Tomorrow we will receive His Holiness Pope Francis here. In this context, however, I would like to refer today to recent events in the Middle East. Last week, we witnessed a bitter attack on a synagogue in Jerusalem, a city that is a holy city for three religious communities in the world. The Middle East as a whole is deeply shaken by this attack. Five people died and countless were injured. It is certainly shocking for all of us when an attack is carried out on a church where people pray. In this case, it was a Jewish synagogue, but it also applies to every other place of worship where people want to pray for an attack. This is a new level of violence which I believe we all condemn in the strongest possible terms here in Parliament. The right of believers, regardless of religion, to pray in safety must not be endangered under any circumstances or at any time. That is why such attacks are an attack on peace. I appeal to everyone not to let the violence escalate. The endless cycle of violence and counter-violence must be ended. The senseless killing must stop. We have often called – and I repeat this on behalf of all of you – to call on those responsible to take the path of dialogue, to seek a peaceful solution.

We have said to other groups in this Parliament that we want to be as flexible as possible and to try to assemble a big majority. To my friend and colleague Mr Preda I would say that we have had some discussions on this. He has indicated that the PPE Group currently has a set position and is not prepared to go beyond it. We all understand the sensitivities. I believe compromises are available, but the position of the PPE tonight is that recognition can only be an outcome of talks. That, in fact, is the current situation. However, saying that this is a contribution towards the two-state solution and that peace will not be achieved without talks are, for example, possibilities. There is wording there from which we could negotiate – as the ALDE Group has said – recognising the debate and supporting the process. I believe a consensus is possible, but what concerns me – and we are delaying the vote as we speak – is that there is no indication at the moment of preparedness to look for that consensus. Therefore I would like us to go ahead with the negotiation on a text to see if we can achieve consensus. In conclusion, we see Sweden, Ireland, Spain, the UK, and soon France, voting for recognition.

I would therefore expect broad and unconditional support for this motion. But unfortunately I know that the situation will be different because this House has shown over the years that it is the temple of European hypocrisy. Let me give you a quick review from our GUE colleagues, who may not have noticed that we have just celebrated the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall and that perhaps we should also cooperate with those who consider it unpresentable, by virtue of their supposed moral superiority. Let us be quite clear that we do not accept lessons in democracy from anyone, because we have seen in recent months what is inside the concept of democracy, which for us is quite different and we are proud of it. I would like to say to my Colleagues on the Greens that the time has come to choose which side to stand on, either together with the grand coalition that governs Europe, or with us to change it. You have to decide, you can't keep having your foot in two shoes. A clear choice has been made by the Liberals, who, after the electoral ballast of the European elections, are now completely subject to the people and socialists. However, I would traditionally expect them to show pride, as Juncker has shown that he represents the antithesis to European ideals. But I would like to dwell for a moment on my Socialist colleagues and their President Pittella, who had said in recent days that he wanted explanations from Juncker or would have distrusted him. I ask you: are you satisfied with Juncker's non-answers? How can you believe that you will do what you have theoretically promised if, in practice, you have always behaved in the opposite way? Mr Pittella, you asked yourself whether Juncker was on the side of citizens or tax evaders. We all know clearly which side Juncker is on and it is certainly not that of the European citizens, who, as Prime Minister of the Grand Duchy, have taken billions of potential resources into the pockets of multinationals. I find it paradoxical that only we, what you call Eurosceptics, have remained to defend the interests of European citizens and the very dignity of Europe. You care about and only defend the interests of Juncker's friends, namely the large multinational capital and strong powers. Mr Juncker, you are the worst image of this Europe. At the head of the Eurogroup, she supported all European failed policies and at the same time as you starve Greece, she took billions from her European partners through agreements with the major international giants. If you had a shred of dignity, you'd have to leave. You have shown that you do not have the credibility to represent Europeans. With this motion we can give that strong signal of change that Europe needs. We are giving you all the opportunity to demonstrate that this Parliament, the only institution legitimised by the people, protects the interests of the citizens and not of the multinationals and banks, of the strong powers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 19, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Mitglied der Kommission. - Herr President, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Zuerst mechte ich mich dafar entschuldigen, dass ich dieser Debatte nicht von Anfang an beiwohnen konnte. Das ist kein Zeichen der Unh-flichkeit, sondern ein Zeichen unbew-ltigter Verkehrsstrom zwischen Saverne und Strasburg. Ich bitte, das vielmals zu entschuldigen. Zu dem Misstrauensantrag der Kollegen selbst mechte ich sagen, dass ich mich in Bressel anlàsslich des letzten Plenums des Europeischen Parlaments uningeladen dem Parlament gestellt habe und die notwendigen Erkl-rungen abgeben habe. Nun kann man parlamentarische Debatten als die Vervielf-ltigung und Wiederholung derselben verstehen. Aber das, was ich am 13. November in Bressel zum Ausdruck gebracht habe, entspricht genau meiner Einsch-tzung der Lage. I have drawn the attention of all my colleagues here gathered to the fact that, from my point of view, the interaction between divergent national legal provisions leads to and leads to a situation that could lead, in extreme cases, to the under-taxation of European and third-party companies which will have to be avoided in the future and which in no way reflects what I will call the ethical and moral consensus which is of convenience. The problem is not only Luxembourg but more ecumenical, European, since advance tax rulings apply in twenty-two Countries of the European Union. That is why I have proposed a number of behavioural changes that we will have to adopt.  During the election campaign, during my inaugural speech on 15 July and during the Commission's inaugural address in October, I called for the establishment of a system that will be characterised by a common base in Europe with regard to corporate taxation. I added that I am in favour of the Financial Transaction Tax, which is no longer a matter for the Commission because we are engaged in a process of enhanced cooperation between the Member States concerned. I have called for the establishment of an automatic exchange system for early tax decisions between the Member States of the European Union. On behalf of Europe, I defended this issue at the G20 in Brisbane, Australia, and I was supported in my approach by the Heads of State or Government of France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Spain, Italy and the OECD Secretary-General. Despite this massive reinforcement, I must have noticed that the G20 was not able to mention in its conclusions the reference necessary for the automatic exchange of information, satisfied with a general sentence on transparency in advance tax decisions. All Europeans supported me, however, unless those who did not speak are suspected of fuelling different intentions. I would like to remind you that, when I was President of the European Union in 2005, President of the European Council and President of the ECOFIN Council, I proposed to my colleagues in the ECOFIN Council the establishment of a tax committee of the same rank as the Economic and Financial Committee so that we would be better able, at a high level, to follow the implementation of the conclusions of the Good Conduct Group and the code of conduct that we had adopted under my presidency. 1997. All of this has not been successful. I would like to invite the Council, the Italian Presidency, to propose again to the ECOFIN Council and to the European Council the establishment of a tax committee which will rank as high as the Economic and Financial Committee which, as a rule, prepares decisions and meetings of the ECOFIN Council. As for the motion of censure before us today, it has its place in the internal rules of this House. I would have preferred it to be introduced in due course, in November when I first spoke to this House after my decision. When I see the identity of the signatories of this motion of censure, I wonder about the profound meaning of it. I believe that I have to answer the questions that will be put to me every time this House asks, but I have the impression that the intention of the authors of this motion is not what they are echoing, since they should know that I am not a friend of the great capital. I repeat that the hilarity movement in the upper floors of European multinationals was great when I was accused of this friendship.  I want to add a few words. The motions of censure are addressed to the whole Commission and I have the impression that I am the only one being questioned. On 15 July, I said here that if the European Parliament ever withdrew its trust in a member of the Commission, he would be asked by the President of the Commission to resign.

Jean-Claude Juncker has put forward proposals on how we can tackle the issues of tax justice in Europe. My group wants tax justice, we want to put an end to the fact that large corporations can withdraw from their tax burden and get out of it. But we also want us to make progress. That is why we need a Commission that puts proposals on the table and launches initiatives. That is what Jean-Claude Juncker has done, that is what the Commission intends to do, and it has our full support in doing so. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will reject the motion on Thursday. Incidentally, I would like to point out that the whole Commission is present – a strong sign of unity and a sign that the gentlemen and ladies we elected four weeks ago want to work. They want to get to work, and we want to support them in that. (Applause) Farage, Le Pen and others who have signed may be delighted to see them again enjoying a few minutes of media attention. Incidentally, this only underlines the fact that all Members, including the right, have the same rights here in this House. When amendments are tabled, they are discussed and voted on. Unfortunately, however, our rights rarely receive attention because they never work constructively, but are always involved with the destructive. (Applause) Frankly, in the debate today, it goes through my mind that the issue we are talking about is actually the ideal world of Mrs Le Pen and Mr Farage. We are talking about tax issues. In tax matters, no EU Commission official has a formal decision to decide, since no Member of the European Parliament has anything to decide formally, there are not bad bureaucrats in Brussels who have to make a formal decision, but tax law is in the hands of the Member States, of sovereign, independent Member States, just as it is the ideal image of colleagues on the right. In practical terms, Why, in this ideal world in which Mr Farage and Mrs Le Pen live, is it really not possible to solve this tax problem? Ladies and gentlemen, the Europe that you have in mind is to blame for the fact that the corporations can take this out of themselves, the Farage Europe is to blame for the fact that these groups do not pay taxes today because the Member States are unable to solve the problem! (Applause) Because we are talking today about the initiators, about the EFDD Group, it is worth looking at this group. Mr Zanni of the Grillo people presented this initiative today. You are talking about': 'We are Europe!' I always ask myself: who is \"we\"?  I look at the EFDD Group, for example: the Grillo people are saying: 'We need more solidarity on immigration'. Farage walks around the UK and says: \"I'm even throwing the Romanians out of Britain.\" There are Romanians and Poles in your group who say' that 'we need equal rights as the founding fathers of the EU in western Europe', and at the same time we are seeing Le Pen say' 'I do not want solidarity in this Europe, on this continent'. In your group, Mr Zanni, we have many colleagues who work with images of enemies, against foreigners, against refugees, against minorities, against Jews. There are many of us working with these images, and you are standing here and saying that they represent the new Europe. Ladies and gentlemen, you are not the new Europe, you are the old Europe! (Tumult) (Applause) Mr. President! I am looking forward to Thursday and to the vote because we are not voting on whether or not the Commission can continue to work. I want her to be able to work, and there will be a large majority for that. We will vote on Thursday on whether or not to give the right-wing populists and the right-wing radicals a success. I do not want this success for the right-wing radicals in this House!

I do not usually respond to insults, because there is an old maxim that says: 'He who spits in the air, in the head is caught', but there is one thing that deserves an answer and that is the accusation in this House. You see, there are hundreds of Colleagues here who often disagree with each other, but who have always defended and exalted the dignity and prestige of the European Parliament. The European Parliament is the only supranational institution directly elected by the citizens and we are here representing millions of citizens. (In response to the verbal assault carried out on a microphone by Mr Sn. Agea) You should be educated first, because the first rule is education. I did not reply to my colleague when he attacked my group and my person. And she's a distumata! With today's vote of no confidence, the European Parliament could, in spite of itself, go down in history: I do not think it has ever happened that an executive is distrusted 24 days after taking office. Let us see what happens if we send all the Commissioners home. The $300 billion investment plan that will be announced in two days' time would jump. This would erase Europe's last chance to create jobs and combat the crisis. Exhausting negotiations between the Member States to appoint the new Commission would begin again. Months would be spent forming a new college and, in the meantime, the European economy and society would collapse. In the absence of answers, unemployment would explode. Our continent would sink into deflation, maybe that's what you want? Perhaps that is the status quo, the quagmire, the lack of answers that you want? We're not there! Mr President, dear Commissioners, what you must fear today is the citizens' motion of no confidence. If we do nothing against the crisis, we will all be wiped out! And so I say to you: at work! At work, to launch the investment plan! At work, to combat tax avoidance and evasion!  The practices of those multinationals which evade and evade taxes with the complicity of too many governments are extremely serious. We asked you about this, Mr President, two weeks ago, and you assured us that everything will be done to harmonise our tax systems and you convinced us in terms of content. We didn't give you a guarantee. We have given you proof and confidence based on the substance of your proposals and we will monitor that.  We're not waking up now! We did not have to wait for a few newspaper headlines to denounce the dubious tax practices of multinationals and governments. Parliament has worked. I have mentioned the proposals contained in a European Parliament report adopted during the last parliamentary term: concrete proposals that we will take up again and entrust to the wise work of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and European Affairs. This is the serious way to combat a scourge as big as that of tax avoidance and evasion. But this is also the serious way to move a Government, a Commission and a European President forward, so that they work in the interests of our fellow citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 22, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Ryszard Antoni LEGUTKO", "mepid": "96796", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I will not be speaking about the personal virtues or vices of the authors of this motion because I do not know the authors of this motion or their intentions. I am not interested in that. What I will be speaking about is the Juncker problem. There is such a thing as the Juncker problem. President Juncker, let us admit that you did not make a good start. Moreover, I am not quite satisfied with what you said last time, and I am not utterly convinced by what you said today. If you will pardon the expression, I did not have the feeling that you have any pangs of conscience at all. It is a rare thing in politicians, but sometimes it is quite possible. But one thing must be clear enough. We really need full information about the special tax agreements and all the possible ramifications. When I said we need it, I meant ‘we’ meaning the European peoples – the peoples of Europe against whom these agreements were directed, including my own country, which lost several billions of euros as a result of the unethical ingenuity of the leaders of Luxembourg. That is not a minor issue. When I say ‘we’, I also mean the MEPs, the majority of whom voted for you not long ago. It is also good for you, President Juncker. You need it yourself because, whatever you do as President of the Commission, the shadow of this scandal will follow you with your name attached to it until the matter is settled once and for all. Who should do the investigating and the explaining? Of course, primarily the authorities of Luxembourg and independent international bodies, and forums such as the OECD. But I must say that I feel somewhat uneasy about the Commission with you, President Juncker, at its helm investigating the case. I do not know about you, but I personally feel deeply attached to the old Roman principle nemo iudex in causa sua: no one is to be a judge in his own case. I believe the old Roman principle is sacred, and we cannot violate it unless we want to make a laughing stock of ourselves. It is utterly unacceptable to seize this opportunity to go ahead with the plan for tax harmonisation – not now, if ever at all, not under this pretext, not in the state the EU is in now, and certainly not with the Commission under your leadership.

Why? Because I think that everybody can feel, and even the spokesmen of the ECR can feel, that it is nothing more than a little game played by the two groups – the EFDD of Mr Farage and the group of Ms Le Pen (NI). I understand this game; it is a game that is normal in politics, I should say, based on what I call a perverted logic. The logic of this motion is perverted because what they want is that we should make a judgement on ‘Lux Leaks’ before the investigations by the Commission and by Parliament; and that is not serious at all. To come forward now with a motion at a time when we are asking the Commission to look into the matter and when we are actually about to set up a parliamentary committee - what is this nonsense, to start with a motion of censure before we have even started to investigate? For me, the only interesting thing about this motion is not its content; it is the fact that, finally, Mr Farage and Ms Le Pen are now finally outing their hidden relationship. That is the most important thing about this motion: their hidden relationship; the fact that they are actually following the same populist strategy, contrary to what Mr Farage said to his voters in Britain. Indeed it is proof of the fact that UKIP is hideous, racist, xenophobic and islamophobic. Those are not my words; they are the words of the founder of UKIP, Mr Alan Sked himself. So, in my opinion, your group – and I say that to Mr Zanni – is in fact not at all interested in clarifying or resolving international tax avoidance; and I find it very strange that Mr Zanni is pointing the finger at us. Put your own house in order, Mr Zanni, because one of the big specialists in all this is Mr Farage. It is he who has an off-shore tax team in the Isle of Man. So put your own house in order. I should in fact say the same thing to Ms Le Pen, because in a few minutes we shall have the fury of Ms Le Pen coming over this House again. In fact, she borrows money from dodgy Russian banks to finance her political actions. Nobody else does that. So I believe that in reality – and Mr Weber has already indicated that he has said really true things – she and you, Mr Farage, are against Europe, and it is not in this way that we shall have more European cooperation. My conclusion is very simple: let us get back to work and let us vote against this stupid motion.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Juncker, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work he has done. Our criticism of you remains, and we have already expressed this criticism during the first joint hearing, when you presented yourself in our group. We pointed out at the time how problematic it is – given the accusation that Luxembourg is a tax haven, that corporate taxes are being evaded there – to start here with the aim of closing precisely these tax loopholes and ensuring fair taxation within the European Union. When the documents became known – and it was only about the documents of companies that have teamed up with PricewaterhouseCoopers, So we were advised by those who were 340 companies, 340 companies for which there were 548 so-called rulings in Luxembourg – after that we immediately said: we must open a debate here in the European Parliament that makes it clear that change, the way forward, towards more solidarity, to financing that is actually used for solidarity-based European integration, and here also credibility in the European Union must be at the forefront. And we asked you how you feel about it. And I can only say on the part of my group that we were also disappointed by your speech ten days ago in Brussels! We were expecting clearer words. We expected you to understand that it is not just a criticism of you as a person, but that it is the criticism of a system that now bears your name. The Juncker system. That is the problem at stake here! It's not just about you! The point is – and you said this in a minor sentence – that 22 Countries of the European Union are now practising precisely this system in different terms and in terms of design. You asked Verhofstadt, you reminded him of his role. You have certainly not done so wrongly. But what is at stake if credibility is really to be achieved would be a very clear commitment to your responsibility. You have tried to explain that, as President of the Commission, you do not stand for Luxembourg. And that is not possible! That is absolutely not possible, we will not take that away from you! For this reason, we also made a motion at the time, a motion of censure. Unfortunately, we did not get the signatures for this, because we have made it clear from the outset that we do not want votes from the right-wing camp, the far-right nationalists. Because the Europe that these Members want is a different Europe. I will refer to the submission of the motion earlier. You have called for the European Union to be changed together with you. But they did not say where this change should go. I believe that this is the crucial point. That is the point that distinguished our request from what parts of you want. And anyone who goes to the motion with Mr Farage and Marine Le Pen cannot and should not be surprised that others refuse. It is up to you to say that we want to change, we want to go in one direction, to go towards a social union based on solidarity. But then you will also have to decide with whom you are in a group. Then you have to decide with whom you go on an application. We stick to it: we want this change. And here we are also disappointed by the Greens, we also say that we are disappointed with the Social Democrats that ten days ago they did not take the opportunity to discuss it with us and to make the debate here public about what other Europe we want to have on the tax issue. That would have been an opportunity! We now have the opportunity to get at least one committee of inquiry through together. That is more than a special committee.

I think that the whole debate on Luxleaks is actually too serious to clarify the self-image of those who sit on the right side of the House and who, in some cases, have often expressed doubts about their placement. In any case, I certainly remember such discussions with the representatives of the 5 Star Movement. But it may be that all this is no longer the case. So let's put it aside. I believe that we are indeed in a very difficult situation with the European institutions, because the publication of Luxleaks came at a time when we really wanted to start afresh and wanted new enthusiasm for a better European policy of solidarity. Indeed, what constitutes Luxleaks has caused a new great unease about the functioning of the European Union. The impression has once again arisen that solidarity is not the top principle in Europe, but that in Europe individuals are in fact constantly trying to make profits at the expense of others and to achieve better positions for their countries. How it came about, let's face it. But that is the perception of many people, especially in the countries where, with the austerity policies of recent years, we have ensured that the states no longer function in the way that the small people and the small businesses, which pay their taxes properly, actually deserve and rightly expect. That is why I believe that this debate about what the Member States actually have as revenue, what they need to function well for their citizens, is a debate that we must have. And if Mr Zanni thinks that I have now joined my group as the representatives of big business, then he is mistaken, that is by no means the case. We want this to be clarified, we want unconditional clarification, and we see that this is better guaranteed if we do not simply move on to this almost ritual act that is known from politics: bring me the head of Jean-Claude Juncker. And then everything is back to what it used to be. On the contrary, we believe that Jean-Claude Juncker, precisely because he is the one that Europe is looking at and with whom Europe has a great deal of expectations and a new beginning, is today in favour of changing the things that have gone wrong in Luxembourg, but also in other countries, in the Netherlands, in Ireland, in Austria – I can make the list longer – including with the tolerance of all the Heads of State or Government and all the Finance Ministers. This starts with a crystal clear, hard and consistent enlightenment. This goes further with the fact that the consequences actually need to be prepared now. The eternal debate about a common tax base for corporate taxation must end. And for me, the question for Jean-Claude Juncker is: being or not being. Either you manage to clarify this – I know that you cannot do this alone, and that is also why I am opposed to this demand for resignation – but either you manage to do so with your European spirit, which you want to put into the institutions differently from your predecessor, or it just becomes gloomy. And here I address the whole Commission: that is not Mr Juncker's problem alone.

This is an ugly tax scandal that will not go away. The stain of deceit has seeped into you and, the longer you stay in that seat, the further the stain will seep up the chain behind you throughout the Commission. The stain is deep, because here in this Chamber today you have said that you are not a friend of big business; yet, whilst you were the leader of Luxembourg, you permitted 240 multinationals and corporations to enter into aggressive corporate tax avoidance. If that is what not being a friend is, I would love to see what being an enemy is. Some of these companies paid as little as one per cent, and yet you stood through the elections and said you wanted to stand in solidarity with the people of Europe. Yes, the people of Europe are in austerity, they have high rates of unemployment and there is poverty sweeping across Europe like a plague. Yet you ensured that the people of Luxembourg benefited from your largesse. You said that these were extreme circumstances, not just for your country; yet I do not see Germany or Britain or France or Italy having 240 companies with corporations earning one per cent. You talked of changes of behaviour, but the only behaviour that needs to change is yours. You ask others in this Chamber to attack us, simply because we are asking where the solidarity was when you put Greece through the troika, knowing millions of euros from dodgy tax deals with multinationals were flowing through Luxembourg’s coffers. Where is the solidarity when Italy has 55% unemployment and Luxembourg does not? Where is solidarity when you stood in this Chamber and said that these deals were done in the name of Europe? When I look at the people in this Chamber, you have to ask yourselves whether you are the moral guardians of the people who voted for you. Are you going to be seen as the Members who vote for your own and keep your own in place, or are you actually going to listen to the people and say that from time to time we must get rid of those who do not have the European ideal that you say that you believe in?

You have forgotten, however, in your apocalyptic vision of the possible censorship of the Commission, the invasion of locusts and the rain of frogs. As for you, Mr Verhofstadt, you have not forgotten anything about all the insults and defamations that have engulfed your eructation, because I cannot find any other word in the rich French vocabulary, it must be said, to describe your intervention.  The reality is that, thanks to the leak of documents, we have further proof that Luxembourg is organising a very large-scale tax evasion in the European Union. More than three hundred multinationals have signed agreements with the country's administration to get big tax rebates. Once the rebate was obtained, the profits were repatriated to Luxembourg through various financial artifices. This little game has siphoned off the tax revenues of the countries of the European Union and, of course, those of France. Thus, French citizens will be pleased to learn that thanks to Mr Juncker, they must pay more taxes to compensate for the leakage of tax revenues organised by Luxembourg, which is not the only country concerned but plays a central role in the tax optimization schemes of multinationals. Techniques based on the artificial location of patents, transfer prices distorted between subsidiaries, combinations of subsidiaries between tax havens allow very wealthy multinationals to pay almost no tax in countries producing wealth. Merchant websites such as Amazon and ITunes have been able to locate artificial activities in Luxembourg and benefit from reduced VAT rates to sell their products in France. Worse, this VAT is collected in Luxembourg when it should return to the country of the consumer. It is a real tax toolkit that Luxembourg offers to multinationals, based - it is true - on the rules put in place by the European Union.  This has enabled Luxembourg to offer a very high standard of living to its inhabitants with highly paid financial and legal jobs. On the other hand, this has greatly impoverished other European Union countries. Mr Juncker, speaking of you in front of the French Senate, the former finance minister, Jean Arthuis, who is not exactly from my parish, said: \"In the morning, he reminds us of our obligations to balance public finances and, in the afternoon, he makes our pockets thanks to the Luxembourg regime on taxation and banking secrecy\". Mr Juncker, you were the Prime Minister of Luxembourg from 1995 to 2013. You are fully responsible for allowing these large-scale tax evasion techniques to be implemented. No supposed person can believe that you can fight sincerely and firmly to undo tomorrow what you have done. It would be as credible as appointing Al Capone as chairman of the Security and Ethics Committee.  That is why we are taking part in this motion of censure and asking all politicians who want to fight this scandalous escape to overthrow the Juncker Commission. It should be noted that you are not the only one responsible, you are just the best example of the monster that has become the European Union but we do not forget who made you King Mr Juncker: the EPP, the PES and the liberals as well as, in France, the UMP and the PS, carry with you the opprobrium of the symbol you have become, that of a Europe of scheming , greed, injustice and cynicism that abandons the small in favour of the bigger ones.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 32, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. Mr President, there is a great temptation to answer only to Mrs Le Pen, who covers me with tenderness every time she speaks in this Chamber. Irrespective of that, however, I would like to respond to some elements of the debate that have been put forward. Frau Zimmer, Sie reden von einem \"System Juncker.\" Mit welchem Recht tun Sie das? Sie haben - wie viele andere Kollegen auch - darauf hingewiesen, dass das System, das Sie mit meinem Namen belegen, eigentlich das Gesamtresultat widerspr-chlicher innerstaatlicher steuerlicher Gesetzgebungen in ganz Europa ist. Also belegen Sie ein System, an dessen Ursprung ich nicht stehe, das ich nicht herbeigef-hrt habe, das ich nicht systematisiert habe, sondern das sich aus den unterschiedlichen steuerlichen Bestimmungen in unseren Mitgliedstaaten ergibt, nicht mit meinem Namen! Before you, I have said repeatedly that the Commission I have the honour of chairing will fight tax evasion and tax evasion. I said before you less than a fortnight ago what instruments we are going to use to ensure that such non-taxation phenomena can no longer occur because they do not meet the normal ethical and moral requirements. I have asked my colleague, Mr Moscovici, to draw up a directive which will ensure that there is now an automatic exchange of information on early tax decisions between us between the 28 Member States. I understand that all the groups support this approach, I have not heard a single voice saying that it should not be conducted. I therefore want to believe that, in your countries, in your parties, in your national parliaments, you will deploy treasures of influence so that the twenty-eight Member States will accompany the Commission on this path. I'm counting on you. It is not enough to make pathetic appeals to me, it is a question of ensuring that, in each country, the consensus is established around the idea that, in terms of early tax decision, an automatic exchange of information will be needed.  When I proposed in Brisbane, Australia, that this rule become a global rule, I noted that the enthusiasm of others was very limited. So we will all have to make sure that the consensus is reached around this idea. I understand that all the parliamentary groups, all the members of this House will support me, when I ask the Italian Presidency and those who will follow, to set up, at the level of the Council of Ministers and the Member States, a tax group that will ensure the scrupulous application of the requirements arising from the code of conduct against unfair tax competition. , which we set up in 1997. In 2005, this idea was rejected when I proposed it. Today, I note that all Members of the European Parliament agree that a tax committee will have to be set up, on an equal footing with the Economic and Financial Committee, which will ensure the proper application of the rules and which will accompany, in formulating proposals, the Council of Ministers of Economy and Finance when it comes to setting up this system. I am advocating for tax harmonization, which is not a plea against tax competition. Tax competition is healthy, unhealthy when it is unfairly conducted. The Commission I have the honour of chairing will fight with all its might against unfair tax competition. Don't question my word. I am speaking before a European Parliament. I am speaking to the European Parliament when I commit myself, on behalf of the Commission, to realising what is one of the basic elements of the programme that I have set out to you and on which I have been elected. I intend to stick to that, and I expect that all commissioners will stick to it, which they will do. And I expect that all those who have invested in the Commission, which I chair, will ensure that the Commission's programme is implemented, both its principles and the details. That is my commitment. I have a contract with Parliament. I was elected on a $300 billion investment program, which I will have the honour of presenting to you on Wednesday morning. I was elected on basic principles relating to the functioning of European democracy.

The European Union is indeed a global leader here, not only because it is the largest donor, but also because as a community based on democratic values it is absolutely convinced of the universality of every man's right to peace and freedom, to a dignified life, to the right of every society to development, to sustainable economic, social and environmental development. This is why it is important that in preparing a new Global Development Framework after 2015, in the international negotiations to be conducted next year, the European Union takes a strong and unified position, to speak with one voice.  With a Resolution of the European Parliament, we therefore send a clear message to the Council that in December we want Member States to put aside what separates them and put emphasis on what brings us Europeans together in the fight against poverty in the world, in the fight against inequalities, in promoting sustainable development. In December, we want the Council to adopt a common position for the European Union to strongly and effectively enter into negotiations for a new Global Development Framework that will replace the old Millennium Goals of 2000 and adopt a new set of post-2015 targets.  This new Global Development Framework must be transformative, it must touch not only on the symptoms but also on the causes of poverty and modern sleuths that oppress human dignity and prevent sustainable development.  In doing so, we do not want to diminish the importance that the Millennium Goals have had so far and all their positive effects, especially in middle-income countries. But we also need to note that this progress, especially when it comes to economic growth, has not been felt equally by everyone. Despite the achievements of the Millennium Goals so far, there is still a \"hunger scandal\" in the world, as Pope Francis himself has pointed out, which we will receive in the European Parliament tomorrow. And indeed, it is a scandal, because there is food in the world for everyone, but there is no justice for all. That is why in this resolution we stressed that the new Global Development Framework must be imbued with a single approach that will be based on promoting the rule of law and respecting human rights.  In this regard, we welcome the work of the United Nations Open Working Group, which has proposed a new set of objectives, among which there are innovative objectives that coincide precisely with this view. In the upcoming negotiations, we want to preserve this, in particular goal number 16, and we would like to remain ambitious and also stress the need to promote \"good rule\", \"good governance\", because we think it is necessary if we really want a transformative framework that will be effective in eradicating poverty, fighting inequalities and promoting development. We know that it will not be easy to insist on this principle of \"good rule\" in international negotiations, but we must do so, otherwise corruption will eat up funds that are intended for development, will allude or even surpass development efforts, and the gap between the extremely poor and the extremely rich will continue to widen. For the success of the transformative Global Development Framework, we also need a renewed Global Partnership for Development in which new growing economies must take greater responsibility, but also the private sector, of course with clear guidelines and control mechanisms. We also need to involve civil society, local authorities and national parliaments more. The resolution also highlights the central role of women in development policy. Unlike the Millennium Goals, which were intended only for developing countries, we want the new Global Framework to set targets for all countries in the world, including the European Union and its Member States. In this resolution, we emphasise such a principle of universality and therefore the need for the European Union to bring all its foreign and internal policies in line with the new objectives. Colleagues, we live in a globalized world where both our security and prosperity in Europe are more connected than ever to the fate of those poorest who are on the margins of the international order. Let's just look at the ebola epidemic situation. Didn't we in Europe feel the consequences of the absence of a coherent health system in West Africa that could not stop the virus from spreading massively in time.  Europe cannot be safe if it is surrounded by the hungry and extremely poor. Extreme opportunities for poverty, bastards and hopelessness are fertile ground for the spread of radical forces. Effective development policy is therefore the best response against any radicalism, and this of course also applies to opportunities within the European Union.  Finally, Mr. President, I want to say that in preparing this resolution we have worked together, all political groups, and therefore I especially want to thank all shadow rapporteurs for their constructive approach. We now expect this same approach from the Council so that the European Union speaks with one voice and remains a force for Well, strength for development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 1, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 41, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I welcome this timely report and thank Mr Stier as rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Development for their efforts in putting together a clear set of messages for the post-2015 agenda. This is indeed a very valuable contribution that will help shape the EU’s position on this important issue. The global debate on the sustainable development goals represents a profound shift in the way the world thinks and acts in international development. I warmly welcome Parliament’s active engagement in this important political discussion, which resonates widely with the public. Today 1.2 billion people still live in extreme poverty. The geography and demographics of poverty are changing. For instance, new actors, emerging economies and private foundations are coming forward, some of them donors in their own right. New conflicts and demands for better governance are reshaping parts of the world. Our planet’s natural resources are in decline and the impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss are becoming close to irreversible. This is why, when addressing Parliament as Commissioner-designate about two months ago, I made it absolutely clear that an ambitious post-2015 development framework is my top priority. The Millennium Development Goals have been enormously helpful in guiding our development efforts since 2000, but we need a new agenda to meet the new challenges before us today: an agenda that includes all three dimensions of sustainable development – social, economic and environmental – in an integrated and balanced manner; an agenda that addresses inequalities and takes a human rights-based approach. The universality principle is a profoundly important feature of this new framework. Universality means that the new framework will apply to all countries of the world, while taking into account national contexts, capacities and levels of development. It also means that the new goals will have far-reaching implications for the EU institutions and for Member States’ domestic policies. I invite Parliament to continue proactively to engage in this important agenda, not only from the development perspective but across all the relevant policy areas. I believe this report is a helpful contribution to a stronger EU position, and I hope it will also help engage our citizens, mobilise support for sustainable development and demonstrate the benefits of working together in shaping our common future.

I agree that it is the fight against poverty that should remain a priority on the post-2015 development agenda. As a member of the Committee on Culture and Education, I cannot help but draw attention to the importance of access to quality education, as this adequate knowledge is very often a determining factor for the development of the individual, which gives hope for a way out of poverty. Nor can the issues of human rights and the rule of law and social justice be overlooked, as they are directly linked, since only in the case of equal access to employment, education or other privileges for all, can the sustainable development of a particular region be possible.  It is therefore important to maintain the 16th point on sustainable development proposed by the UN, which calls for the promotion of a peaceful, integrated society, the rule of law and the effective operation of state institutions. I also agree with the statement that local authorities cannot be deprived of their competences, because they are the authorities who know the needs of their citizens best. I call on the Council and the Member States to adopt a unified and coherent EU position in the December Council conclusions.

With the rapporteur, Mr Stier, and the other shadows and all my fellow Members who have contributed, we have done an enormous amount of work in a very short space of time, in a collaborative spirit and with an awareness of the importance of this report, which will constitute this Parliament's position on the definition of the Sustainable Development Goals to be negotiated at the United Nations next year. It is an ambitious and balanced report which met with a very large majority in committee. It is essential that we find an equally strong majority in this House, so that we can present a united position of Parliament and influence the council conclusions of mid-December. As an S&amp;D group, we have placed great emphasis on human rights, which must be at the heart of the new framework, insisting on the principle of non-discrimination and attention to the most vulnerable, as well as minorities, the LGBT community and people with disabilities. We wanted to emphasize the importance of a new global partnership, emphasizing the universality of the new objectives, the real novelty and the real challenge for the coming years. No longer an agenda for developing countries, but shared objectives that apply to all states, including those of the Union.  We have put at the centre the leading role that the European Union will have to play in future negotiations and that it will be able to play all the more strongly the more it is able to speak with one voice, unity and stronger. We wanted the fight against all inequalities to become a top priority on the new agenda at the same level as eradicating poverty and sustainable development. Europe can and must take responsibility for promoting a close fight against inequalities on a global scale, and it must also set an example. Inequalities that have increased incredibly both within states and between states, and to which many of the great challenges we face on a daily basis, such as migratory flows, are linked. It is also important to insist on inequalities because one of the critical issues of previous Millennium Goals is that, although progress has been made, their distribution has been unequal between different social groups.  That is why in the report we clearly defend the Open Working Group's proposal to have a separate objective on reducing inequalities. We wanted to take the work of the Open Working Group as its basis and we believe that the objectives should not be reduced but that, if they are to be reorganised, it must under no circumstances be at the expense of the most ambitious and innovative objectives, including the one on the equality agenda.  As a member of the FEMM Committee, I am delighted that the committee's opinion has been taken very seriously and, as previous speakers have said, the report strongly shows the central role of women in development policies and full respect for their rights, including sexual and reproductive rights.  There are many other innovative and courageous aspects: the fight against poverty, for example, which we are calling for to be measured not only on the basis of income but by taking broader measures of progress and well-being, as well as the desirable raising of the poverty line to two dollars a day; climate change and the need to move decisively and courageously towards finally sustainable production and consumption models; universal access to quality health and education for all; the need to combat corruption, tax evasion and avoidance, which deprive countries of essential resources, including with regard to innovative forms of financing such as the financial transaction tax; and finally the important role played by civil society, organisations, local authorities and national parliaments in the new framework, which will be all the stronger the more shared and built with more hands.  In this sense, we have insisted on the need for all the actors involved, including the private sector, to always be guided by achieving the objectives of development cooperation, respect for human rights, the protection of workers and the environment and the principles of transparency and accountability.  It is a strong and ambitious report, which we hope will find the broadest support from our colleagues - not least because next year will be European Year of Development - with the knowledge that we are also going to vote on the future of our cooperation policy and in the hope that the Union, also with the contribution of the High Representative, Commissioner Mimica and the President of the European Council, will be able to take part in the debate. , may make you feel strong its voice in the community of states, in support of a world not only free from poverty, hunger and disease but also fairer, more equal and more attentive to sustainable development and to the rights of all and all, because I believe that this is our responsibility towards the new generations.

These objectives within the framework of the Millennium Agenda should be achieved globally and locally. The latter local aspect requires particular attention, as economic growth planning and legislative and management action must not ignore social considerations. The european bureaucracy policy so far has deindustrialised the south and east of the European Union, enlarged the area of social inequality and poverty, and, above all, has resulted in an unprecedented scale of economic emigration. As a result of this policy, and with the participation of the government from my country, 2.5 million people have emigrated to seek work. The implementation of EU policies has resulted in the job losses of thousands. This has primarily affected the maritime economy, which should be a pillar of knowledge and innovation, job creation and growth opportunities for the younger generation. It is therefore necessary to rebuild industry and, above all, the maritime economy, which is a prerequisite for returning to sustainable development and combating poverty and social exclusion.  I therefore call on the Commission to develop a comprehensive programme for the recovery of the economy, including the maritime sector, so that all regions, including Western Pomerania, most affected by the current harmful policy, have a chance of development.

This proposal was taken into account in the final compromise. I hope that the Council and the Commission will take this idea forward. In any case, the new goals form a Christmas tree, but it must have a trunk and branches on which decorations can be hung. In this way, development policy will bring errence and effectiveness. The report, which has been drawn up on the basis of almost 500 proposed amendments, is not balanced. Some objectives have gained greater weight than others. When the Committee on the Environment did not deliver its own opinion, the weight of environmental issues is too weak. The amendments tabled by the ALDE Group partially eliminated this deficiency.

The objectives of development policy must be formulated in such a way that they can and must be achieved equally, both in developing and developed countries.

As we approach the Millennium Development Goal deadlines, perhaps we should examine what the EU has done for – or should I say to – the world’s poor. Perhaps we could talk about the EU pesticides directive, which prevents African countries using effective anti-malaria sprays. As a result, 90% of the world’s malaria deaths occur in Africa, the majority of them being children under the age of three. Or perhaps we could talk about the EU fishing boats plundering the fish stocks off the Horn of Africa. This has destroyed the livelihoods of peaceful fishermen, who resorted to piracy against container ships in order to stay alive. Or perhaps we could talk about the EU’s vindictive behaviour in trade talks, where the world’s poor are banned from exporting their most successful produce to European markets, stopping them from trading their way out of poverty and debt. As you can see, the EU is an actor in international development, but a spiteful and an inadequate one. The EU has so starved an impoverished Africa that it is perhaps no surprise that so many migrants risk their lives to escape it, but thankfully countries like India are coming to the rescue.

There are many of them, including the inability of the international community to comply with the objectives it set itself in the 1970s. The disbursement of public aid to the tune of 0.7% of gross domestic product is poor, and this is also due in many European Union states.  The second reason is the mismatch between the production of wealth on the one hand and the capacity for redistribution on the other. One example is emerging countries that produce both rich and even more poor. We need to learn from this situation by empowering everyone in order to achieve a more effective approach.

This implies an awareness of the seriousness of the problems and the importance of the challenges, but it also involves learning from the experience of cooperation policies, their remarkable progress and their deceiting failures.

A step that has proved, over time, effective, in the sense that millions of people have come out of poverty, and other health-related objectives, with education, with the provision of medical or health services have also made decisive progress. But this step is still insufficient. As noted, more than one billion people still live in poverty and yet during this time, inequality has also increased. From a social conscience point of view, inequality is sometimes more bleeding than poverty. In 2015 humanity has two challenges.

Secondly, I welcome the fact that in this report the core issue of climate change has been recognised as one of the main underlying structural factors that lead to poverty and inequality in the current world. Because of climate change, the world will have to face the consequences of struggles over scarce resources, conflict, violence and hunger. Rising sea levels endanger entire regions of the planet, and, if we do not act now, there will be an increase in natural disasters, which will continue to cause the death and suffering of hundreds of thousands or millions of people, often in developing countries, who, let us be clear, are the least responsible for climate change. Therefore, I really welcome the fact that the framework will be universal and the burden is, hopefully, going to be shared. In order to achieve our post-2015 development goals, we must make sure that our development – not only of developing countries but also of European countries – is going to be sustainable. We must find a way to promote growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions by changing energy patterns. We must work closely with NGOs and private organisations which strive to put these principles into practice. It is still within our power to combat the threats that menace the success of our post-2015 development goals. My hope is that, at the upcoming climate conferences in Lima and Paris, the EU will be the leader in the global effort to tackle climate change in advance of the UN Summit in September, since unmitigated climate change creates costs for global development that we absolutely cannot afford.

The feelings of exclusion and alienation that come from this situation can undermine social cohesion and generate disorder and conflict.

It works alongside and shapes a range of policies from foreign affairs, security and trade to the environment, agriculture and fisheries. As such, it gives us considerable negotiating power in the discussions ahead. The EU is the world’s leading donor and its most open market for exports from developing countries and, in particular, the least developed countries. I believe that this gives us a very powerful and influential voice in the post-2015 discussions. The high degree of convergence between the EU position and the open working group report is one manifestation of that influence. Your report is an important contribution from Parliament to forging a clear and strong EU position. I trust that the Council will deliver sound and effective conclusions in a few weeks’ time. But we should not stop there. The global partnership required to implement the new Agenda will need supporting actions from all stakeholders, including Parliament’s. An effective review, monitoring and accountability mechanism will be essential. I see a significant role for parliaments here too, in helping to hold us to account on progress and in encouraging greater ambition, particularly in ensuring that all citizens can indeed benefit. Together let us bring the weight and influence of a coordinated EU position into the intergovernmental negotiations. In September next year the United Nations General Assembly will come together to agree on a new development framework for our time. Let us show how strong a voice the EU can have and how united it can be and influence our partners to reach the best possible outcome.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 82, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Davor Ivo STIER", "mepid": "119435", "text": "  Rapporteur. - Mr. President, this discussion seems to have shown me that the report has one broad support from various political groups. I would like to thank in the end all those who contributed to the discussion, but especially the shadow rapporteurs, because indeed, without their constructive approach in this work, it would not even be possible to draw up such a report that enjoys broad support and sends a very clear message to the Council, which must now draw conclusions in December that will define the position of the European Union. I am so sorry that there are no council representatives here with us now.  However, I would like to highlight good cooperation with Commissioner Mimica. I think that this cooperation will also be extremely important in this coming period, of course in the implementation of this position that the European Union will take. I will not, of course, refer to everything that has already been said today, however, I have to correct some inaccurate allegations from lawmakers mainly from the far right who have now left the chamber, but who complained that there is no word at all in the report about the fight against corruption. Of course that's not true. This was mentioned by Mr Aliot who voted against the report on the committee as well. However, the report has a whole section dealing with this themo, and specifically paragraph 29, very specifically on the fight against corruption. Therefore, before the reviews go, the document must be read.  Of course, what I have said before in my opening words, effective development policy is actually an antidote against all radicalism, both in the world, both in our environment, but of course this also applies within the European Union. So maybe I can understand why some far-right positions don't want to support this approach and this kind of document.

Implementation of cohesion policy was supposed to start in 2014, but the programming stage is still far from being finalised. Only a limited number of operational programmes have been adopted and, according to the latest information available, only just over one hundred programmes will actually be adopted by the end of this year. Moreover, for programmes not ready for adoption by 31 December 2014, 2014 commitments can only be preserved by rebudgeting uncommitted amounts from 2014, in accordance with Article 19 of the Multiannual Financial Framework Regulation. However, this implies a revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, on the basis of a Commission proposal with the Council’s agreement and Parliament’s consent. As a direct consequence, there will be a significant delay in the actual start-up of project implementation. However, 2014 should not be a lost year as regards investments from the five European structural and investment funds. In this context I would like to table the following question. In the light of the above, can the Commission indicate the exact state of play as regards the adoption of the partnership agreement and operational programmes and the estimated timeframe for starting their implementation? What were the main problems encountered, and by which Member States? What is the Commission’s current position regarding the treatment of commitments for operational programmes co-financed by the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund, the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund and the Cohesion Fund, which will not be adopted by the end of 2014? Why has the issue of rebudgeting uncommitted amounts from 2014 in 2015, through revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, not been brought to Parliament’s attention until now? What can be done to ensure that the revision process goes smoothly and is finalised before 1 May 2015, as specified in Article 19 of the Multiannual Financial Framework Regulation, so as to avoid losing uncommitted amounts from 2014? In this connection, does the Commission envisage taking any measures to facilitate implementation of the operational programme? The Commission should analyse all possibilities in order to ensure that all operational programmes resubmitted after the deadline of 24 November 2014 are taken into consideration in order to conclude the inter-service consultation by the end of the year and be treated as ready for adoption if they fulfil the quality requirements. We are aware that the rebudgeting of uncommitted amounts from 2014 in 2015, under Article 19 of the Multiannual Financial Framework, implies a revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework by 1 May 2015, which, even if it is technical, has to comply with the multiannual budget procedure: a Commission proposal for revision of the MFF, consent by Parliament and unanimous adoption by the Council. Moreover, it should be stressed that, in order to have the operational programmes adopted, a corresponding draft amending budget covering the commitment appropriations for 2015 also needs to be approved. This implies, in the best-case scenario, a delay in actually starting to implement those programmes until mid-2015. What measures does the new Commission plan to take to speed up programming in order to ensure that the adoption of OPs takes place as soon as possible without lowering their quality? Can the Commission provide information as to how the situation with regard to unpaid bills from the 2007-2013 programming period affects the adoption of OPs and the start of the new implementation period?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 86, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I am very pleased and honoured to be here as Commissioner for Regional Policy and I thank the Committee on Regional Development for this important question, which allows me to explain where we stand with our cohesion policy programming and the measures that we need to take in order to guarantee smooth and fast completion of the process. Let us start with good news. As you know, all partnership agreements and 39 cohesion policy programmes have been adopted to date, including 24 investment for growth and jobs programmes where REGIO is in the lead, 14 where employment is in the lead, and one European territorial cooperation programme. The first rural development and maritime and fisheries programmes will be adopted by the end of this year and the rest will follow in 2015. As you said, the 2014-2020 legislative package for cohesion policy was adopted very late, in December 2013, six months later than the corresponding package in 2006 for the period 2007-2013, so this late adoption of the multiannual framework and regulation left no time for preparation of the programming period starting on 1 January 2014. Expenditure is eligible as from 1 January 2014, which means that Member States do not need to wait for the programmes to be adopted. They can start implementation of activities in sectors that are not subject to debate with the Commission. In fact, in many regions, calls for proposals and project selection processes have already started, and some of the operations to be supported are already ongoing.  Of course, procedures and projects that started before adoption of the programmes will need to be confirmed and validated by the monitoring committees, once established, and will need to comply with the regulation.  You ask about the main difficulties encountered when discussing operational programmes with Member States; and, of course, circumstances and issues are different from one Member State to another, so I do not think it would be appropriate in such a limited time to give details. But to summarise, I can say that the debates were mainly on a handful of recurrent issues: the insufficient logic of the intervention foreseen, and therefore the need to strengthen the link between needs and challenges, identified inter alia in the country-specific recommendations, and between results to be achieved corresponding to indicators and actions to be supported; the lack of concentration of investment priorities, the fulfilment of ex ante conditionalities, and finally, of course, the importance of having robust strategies in place to enhance administrative capacity. Moving to the question of the programmes that still need to be adopted, we consider that more than half of all cohesion policy programmes will have been adopted either by the end of the year or under the carryover procedure by March at the latest. In order to preserve the 2014 commitments for the remaining programmes, and those that will not be ready for adoption by the end of this year, the Commission intends to present a revision of the MFF by early February 2015. We hope that we can count on the European Parliament and the Council to help us secure early adoption of this MFF revision and the related amending budget before 4 May 2015. The internal Commission procedures have also been streamlined in order to allow them to carry over as many programmes as possible. However, the Commission will not compromise quality over speed. The programmes which set the framework for investment for the next seven years must build on solid strategies so that European taxpayer can be assured of getting the most effective use of their contributions.  Finally, I would like to assure you that the backlog of 2013 unpaid claims for cohesion policy – and I know Mr van Nistelrooij will ask me about that – will not affect the start of the new period, as the newly adopted programmes have immediately received pre-financing. I had an intense discussion with the Commissioner for the Budget and with other colleagues in order to find a solution for these unpaid claims. However, approval of the third amending budget for 2014 and the budget for 2015 by the budgetary authority as foreseen by the Commission remains essential in order to reduce the amount of unpaid claims for the 2007-2013 period for this and next year.

You were all but one of them. Also a good time to put the finger on the investments.  On Wednesday, the Commission will release its Juncker plan for 300 billion. New money, all fine. But today, with this question, we are putting the finger on what we already have, on those budgets that have already been released. And then we are talking about the European investment structures, investment funds in the order of some EUR 360 billion. And then there's an important pain point.  The pain point is - and you also went into it - that this is not getting going quickly enough. You say: 'The formal framework was not approved until the end of 2013'. I'm a little different about that. At the end of 2012 we had all this whole framework together, we had a code of conduct, in which we had agreed with the Member States that they would now really come up with programmes and that they would behave in the spirit of the code of conduct. Well, it has indeed taken some time and that disappoints us. Therefore this question and also this concern. We must ensure that it is transferred in a timely manner, as you have already indicated. We want the exact track book, the exact dates for that from you. Finally, this week is indeed about those investments, that investment plan. Wouldn't you like to go into the following idea: we have so many instruments, we have made risk sharing, public/private partnerships, as well as revolving funds possible in the context of our resolutions. Do you not think that the Juncker Investment Plan is an important basis for doing even more in order to create a smarter, greener and more competitive Europe with jobs?  I'd like to hear that from you. And I'm not going to go into the pile of unpaid bills this time. Because you have reassured me in that regard. I suspect, moreover, that in December the Member States will come up with a very large pile of bills which they have saved up. And then it will turn out that the unpaid bills will be significantly higher at the beginning of next year than we now think.

In line with that tradition, as this is my first speech as an MEP the appropriate reference is the UNESCO World Heritage Site – the Derwent Valley Mills – which runs from the City of Derby, through Amber Valley and into the Derbyshire Dales, a site I was proud to chair for four years. It stands to benefit from ERDF funding and yet could be beset by similar sorts of EU-sourced problems that this question seeks to highlight: bureaucratic delay and not setting out parameters clearly. What I speak in support of tonight is a cross-party question, and that strengthens the concerns expressed.

As has already been said, cohesion policy is one of the EU's most important investment instruments, and I do not need to explain its importance in this House, particularly in the crisis. We must finally invest out of the crisis, instead of further saving into the crisis. I would also like to stress the importance of cohesion policy, particularly in achieving the crucial Europe 2020 objectives that we have all set ourselves together: from the fight against poverty to active labour market policy, from education to fairer distribution. It is precisely here that Europe must not hesitate any longer! It is a truly alarming situation how many operational programmes have still not been adopted. This cannot really be explained to the citizens of Europe – together with the unsustainable state of unpaid bills, which have really reached scandalous proportions, and the fact that the investment plan, as much as it has now been discussed in the media, is still an empty phrase. I hope that will change over the course of the week when it is presented here. We have to do something and we have to act. And I would like to join in all the appeals here, not only to the Commission, but also to the Member States, to the regional level, to all, to work together here to finalise the operational programmes as quickly as possible, so that the funds are released to the citizens in 2014, but also to make the impact of the unpaid bills, for example, on Erasmus students, the scientists of Horizon 2020 and the other stakeholders clear.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 95, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Rosa D'AMATO", "mepid": "124835", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to begin by quoting some data from Eurostat and DG REGIO. Between 2008 and 2013, public investment across the European Union fell by 20% in real terms. In some countries such as Greece, Spain and Ireland, the decline has been close to 60%. Without cohesion policy, investment in the Member States most affected by the crisis would have fallen by a further 50%. The role of the European Structural and Investment Funds is therefore all the more essential, not only as a result of the cuts made by the Member States to reduce budget deficits.  On the other hand, it is all the more serious, precisely in the light of the above, the serious institutional and financial stalemate caused by the delays in cohesion policy already mentioned by my colleagues. It is all the more serious precisely because it is the size of the territory that is at the expense of it, and therefore ultimately the citizens of Europe, who have been dramatically affected by the crisis and who are looking with increasing disaffection at the national and Community institutions. I come from a region, Puglia, and from one part of Italy, the south, where very serious inefficiencies have already occurred, with the result that the Funds have been dispersaled. Adding to this very worrying picture of delays in the start of the 2014-2020 programming would have devastating consequences. I can therefore only share the concern expressed just a few days ago by the President of the Committee of the Regions, Michel Lebrun, when he warns that unless there is complete – and I would add fruitful – rapid and effective cooperation between the Commission, the Member States, the regions and the cities, European investment could reach the territory too late. I also regret having to stress, as my fellow Members have already done, the seriousness of the European Union's eur 23 billion of outstanding accounts in cohesion policy alone, with obviously very serious repercussions on the beneficiaries of the funds.  Having read with curiosity, but also and above all with great concern, the Commissioner's statements made at the General Affairs Council, when she said that she expects cohesion policy to contribute to the EUR 300 billion investment plan proposed by Juncker, I therefore ask: could the Commissioner please clarify exactly what she said?

These delays in payment obviously cause great difficulties for some of our local authorities and businesses. Even with the cohesion policy, which is supposed to translate into action the principle of solidarity that drives you, the European dream turns into a financial nightmare.  These delays in the adoption of operational programmes are due, in part, to the very low absorption capacity of some Member States which cannot effectively spend the financial windfall promised to them. The scandalous transfer of the management of European funds from the State to the regions also has the effect of delaying the launch of the cohesion policy. Worse, the implementation of the 2014-2020 programming by the regions or assimilated communities, which therefore have a weaker administrative structure than their respective states, will result in longer deadlines in the assembly and financing of eligible projects. As such, the Sivens Dam case gives us a bitter taste of the future calamitous cooperation between the European Union and local authorities.

However, the delay in validating operational programs is a serious anomaly that disrupts the start of programming for the multi-year financial framework. As legislators, we take our share of responsibility and will contribute effectively to finding solutions. Having said that, I would like to stress to you that there are two elements. Firstly, the importance of this delay in the programming of the implementation of cohesion policies is that it weakens all the projects seeking public funding throughout Europe, all those investments that Europe so desperately needs in the face of the crisis. If some Member States are more concerned than others, then let us say so, not to denigrate but to help. If the Commission's technical assistance is insufficient, then strengthen it to meet the quality requirement you have raised. This is the Union's priority: to achieve projects and investment as quickly as possible in our Europe in crisis. Secondly, this difficulty in regional policy echoes the budget payments crisis. On 17 November, the European Parliament was forced to abandon the budgetary conciliation procedure, as Member States were unable to present a viable response. However, it is the regions that pay the heaviest price of this budgetary cavalry. The European Commission must propose an emergency mechanism on cohesion policies. Which regions are most affected, what is the amount of unpaid bills in each region, what are the needs?  These two crises have a violent impact on the economic activity of our European territories. Commissioner, we know your unwavering commitment to cohesion policy, so tell Mr Juncker - before he comes to announce his long-awaited recovery plan on Wednesday - that our Europe needs public investment more than ever, that regional policy is part of it and that if we do not fix it, it will be futile to consider other mechanisms than ever before. , which would be bogged down in the shifting sands of sluggish public investment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 99, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Tomasz Piotr PORĘBA", "mepid": "96801", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to begin by thanking Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for Last year, after three years of negotiations, we completed work on a package of new regulations for cohesion policy, thus entering the next programming period.

Meanwhile, it appears that countries and regions are today showing serious delays in launching the 2014-2020 programmes, which, I do not hide, is of increasing concern. Yet the experience of 2007-2013, when the procedures for agreeing entries in documents took a very long time, should be a sufficient warning to all of us.

This was absent, for example, in the division of Croatia into two NUTS II regions, which placed the least developed eastern part of the country in the same statistical region with the richest northwestern part, thus depriving those in need of the necessary funds for development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 116, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   Mr President, I will certainly keep the time.

There were so many problems here and I would like to tell you: I would like to tell you that I am truly aware of the importance of adopting operational programmes as soon as possible, especially for countries where our funds contribute more than 50% in public investment. I would like to tell you that, from the very first day of work as European Commissioner for Regional Policy, I have sent a letter to all the ministers of the European Union states, telling them that it is necessary to step up our efforts for the benefit of, of course, the citizens, and I have had the opportunity to meet with all 28 ministers from the Member States in the Business Council for Cohesion Policy. I am grateful to the Italian Presidency that, for the first time, it has inaugurated this framework for debate between the European Commissioner for Regional Policy and all ministers in this area. I have seen that many of you have thrown all the blame for these delays on the European Commission. Of course the European Commission has its share of the blame, but I remind you that it is a shared responsibility. The principle of 'shared responsibility' is all the more strong here, within the framework of cohesion policy, because those who draw up the programmes, the ones implementing them are the Member States, the regions, the local authorities. As Mr van Niselrooij said, the Commission anticipated the delays and launched discussions on operational programmes as early as 2012, but we must recognise that the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework and the new legislation for European funds had a significant impact on the ability of Member States to submit quality programmes in 2014. Firstly, speed and success depend to a huge extent on the Member States, because they must take into account the Commission's observations, produce the necessary documents. I'll come to the European Parliament on 8 December. I will be here in the European Parliament, in the Committee on Budgetcontrol. I will be responsible for how the taxworkers' money is used. You ask for a more simplified and efficient way, but at the same time control of taxworkers' money is also needed. I hope that we will be able to adopt not 100, but 150 programmes by the end of the year. However, I want to assure you that we have made this 'task force' for countries with a low absorption of European funds, because they are countries – I have also said in the Council, and in the press conference – where money has really been pumped without seeing many results in people's daily lives.  This is the case, for example, of southern Italy and I am ready to go there, to talk to the local authorities, to the regions. If you could tell me how can I approve a programme for southern Italy, which has not even been sent to the European Commission? How could I? I cannot take responsibility for the adoption of these operational programmes without being assured by all the services of the European Commission that all the requirements that you have asked here by the legislation you have adopted are met. Because we are responsible, as you said, for the efficient use of public money.  And we're having this discussion. We had a discussion in Poland. All the operational programmes were concentrated in Warsaw and we asked them to make an effort to lean on eastern Poland, which is an underdeveloped region, because our intention is to bridge the gap. For Bulgaria, I did everything I could. We have unlocked the money that has been locked in for the environment since 2012 because, practically, the conditions have now been met.  It is the Commission's duty to suspend payments, to discontinue payments when there is a suspicion or when OLAF comes into action. We expect the Member State to meet the conditions and, when the conditions are met, we have restarted the money for the operational programmes, where payments have been interrupted. Indeed, we have this ongoing debate with the Member States, and I am glad that I have had the opportunity to talk to ministers, because absorption is necessary but, as I said, we must not take absorption for the sake of absorption. We need to make sure that these operational programmes meet the needs of citizens and the most vulnerable groups.  I want to assure you that you will have a partner in me. I have informed you and I will inform you on a permanent basis, I will try to come up with a roadmap and the answers to the problems you have raised for the operational programmes to be adopted in 2015. We hope to adopt them as soon as possible after the revision of the Multiannual Financial Framework, and I welcome the Latvian Presidency's intention to address this subject with the utmost priority.  Summing up, at the moment we have all the partnership agreements adopted. Out of 310 programmes provided for 14 were adopted by my predecessor, Commissioner Hahn, in 2014-2020. Since we took office we have adopted 25 operational programmes in 21 days and I hope that by the end of the year we will adopt 148-150 operational programmes. Please understand that it is almost physically impossible to adopt all operational programmes, and that is why I have asked the Member States to prioritise which are the most important and, of course, which are ready. We're doing everything we can.  One last topic: I'm just as worried about unpaid bills as you are. All I said was that for the period 2014-2020 pre-financing was passed on, but I know, like you, that the amount of unpaid bills will increase. It's a problem that needs to be solved. I raised it in the college, I spoke to Commissioner Georgieva, because it is not a problem that the Commissioner for Regional Policy can solve on his own.  Thank you once again, please do not hesitate to raise any issues in your region, and I want to assure you that I consider myself the lawyer for the regions and citizens of the European Union in the College of Commissioners.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 118, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF", "mepid": "28242", "text": "   The debate is closed.

In the case of Romania, the Commission specifically commented on the inability to learn from the experience of the previous period (2007–2013). The Commission's objections relate to the lack of sound argument for the continuation of investments and their correlation with existing ones.  We need to understand that economic growth objectives are closely linked to the coordination of sectoral policies, and a strategic approach that pursues a coherent distribution of investments leads to development capacity building and contributes to increased competitiveness.

In this respect, the committee has put this oral question, and I think rightly so. If you look around, you have to say that the European Union's arms export policy is like a Swiss cheese, especially when it comes to dual-use goods. We know that, in the case of heavy goods vehicles, it is indeed still possible to differentiate whether this is one that is more likely to be used to transport machine parts or one that is used to set up a rocket launcher. When it comes to software and IT and communication technologies, it will of course be more difficult. It can be astonishing when an activist in London receives an e-mail about conditions in Bahrain and this e-mail contains a Trojan, which in the future ensures that her smartphone is intercepted, that all texts she types into her smartphone can be read by third parties. We have this kind of use of surveillance software and information and communication technologies everywhere to spy on human rights activists, political opponents, people who defend diversity of opinion and fundamental rights. I therefore believe that it is time to take a closer look. After all, it is not only that activists in other countries, where it is said that there is a terrorist regime or a regime that is not committed to human rights, use these dual-use goods of software and information and communication technologies, but also people in Europe are monitored by forces from third countries through this software. This is not only a problem in Bahrain, where European software has been supplied, it has also been a problem in Iran, where an entire control network has been set up with European technology, or in Syria. The Libyan secret service has bought technology from a company that advertises openly with the slogan \"Best and easiest to monitor\". Even this company says that it has about 50% market share in the Middle East. And if you look a little further, Ethiopia is a customer, Nigeria, Uganda, Qatar – these are all things that don't really fit into the concept of a value-oriented European Union. That is why it is a step in the right way that software Trojans and network control systems were included in the Wassenaar Arrangement in December 2013. But this has not yet resonated in European politics. However, I would like to see an EU system that guarantees that software and information and communication technology cannot be misused and can fall into the hands of those who monitor their populations and people in a way that we do not accept. Incidentally, this also has strategic and safety implications for us, because this software can of course also be used in the digital context in Europe. And that is why, Commissioner, the three questions: what about the uniformity and enforceability of legislation in the field of dual-use? We know that dual-use goods are basically all approved, because we do not seem to have any inhibitions at all to deliver these goods to areas where armed conflict is taking place. Or the second question, the question of control. After all, it is not acceptable to check only ex-post and not to decide in advance which goods to export to which countries. And then, thirdly, we must also find a procedure that is as unbureaucratic as possible and ensures manageability, not ignoring economic interests. In this respect, three sets of questions, and I look forward to your answer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 128, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, thank you so much for raising this extremely important but difficult question. As you know, the European Union is a major producer and exporter of dual-use items and a significant actor in counter-proliferation export controls. Export controls are key to the competitiveness of our exporters – approximately EUR 14 billion of control exports – and this is also crucial to our and international security. Our export control regime has been gradually strengthened in the last decade. It has robust provisions and it provides a solid legal and institutional foundation. It has been a model for many third countries, but of course the world is changing and it cannot remain static. It needs to be re-evaluated and upgraded so that we can face the different challenges that Mr Lange, and others, made reference to. So we need to have a modern control capacity for the coming decade and beyond. I share your concerns over the problems which have been raised and the concerns regarding export of surveillance technology. It can be misused in violation of human rights, and we have taken action to address this very important issue. We have, in record time, prepared and adopted, in October this year, a delegated act to transpose into EU law the multilateral decisions taken under the Wassenaar Arrangement to control intrusion software and Internet monitoring equipment. This is a very important first step. Furthermore, the export of surveillance technologies is an element – and a very important element – of our export control policy review. As you know, the Commission published a Communication in April last year in which we set out some concrete options under a human security approach, to fully take into consideration human rights as a new dimension of export controls. For example, we suggest clearly establishing human rights as a reason for control and possibly denial of export. We want to act quickly, but it is, of course, very important to calibrate our response carefully. We need to identify exactly which items pose a threat to human rights, to our security, and to select effective and targeted controls while being aware that some of these items also have a legitimate use. We should not lose sight of the risk of seeing products exported from third countries replacing our rightful exports. This would harm our competitiveness and offset the positive effects on security, or on respect for human rights, and that is why we have now launched an impact assessment of various options to modify our export control regulations. We also need to take into consideration how we can develop synergies between the different security trade controls. That is only one instrument that we have. We could, for instance, consider restrictions on the export of surveillance technologies by targeting specific countries. This is covered by sanctions under Article 215 of the Treaty. As you know, the Communication has also outlined a vision for a risk-driven model to generate modern control capacities of EU needs for the future. It sets out concrete options to enhance the effectiveness of controls and minimise distortions in competition, and this would improve the level playing field both within the EU and in our relations with third countries. We could, for instance, promote a shift to open licensing: controlling transactions in companies without delaying export and keeping ex-ante controls only for the most sensitive items or destinations. This would reduce delays and costs associated with controls while providing a high level of security. Finally, I share Parliament’s views that the very specific technical nature of these products requires the mobilisation of highly specialised expertise. We are therefore mobilising experts from all over the EU to conduct regular technical examinations of technological developments to ensure that our controls are up to date. We are engaging with stakeholders, particularly civil society organisations and industry representations, so that they can provide important input to this process. In that regard I would like to emphasise that the private sector is, of course, the first line of defence against proliferation and other associated security threats, so we need to develop a real partnership with the private sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 129, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Adam SZEJNFELD", "mepid": "124890", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Controlling international trade in products that may have dual applications is a very difficult task these days. This is not only facilitated by the ease, despite many barriers, of control, of supervision of trade, but above all by the development of research, techniques and technologies, which are intended to have a very universal application, and in fact only it is up to the users to actually use and use them.  Another issue worth highlighting is the increasing share of international trade in small and medium-sized enterprises. This is a very beneficial process. Companies in this sector are an important base of economic systems. Therefore, they should not be subject to excessive controls and bureaucracy.  Dear! Respect for freedom and the building of international security require the creation of legislation and specific procedures for a modern and effective system of control over trade in dual-use products and technologies so that these products are not used for unlawful repression of citizens or aggression against other states or nations. All this must also apply to modern scientific thought, research and development. However, in doing the right thing, care must be taken not to harm the economic development of the Member States of the European Union, the competitiveness of Europe and the important internationalisation of our small and medium-sized enterprises.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. Sometimes politics is tedious. If you look at certain areas of detail, it is even more tedious. I remember well that when I started to deal with dual use things, not as first, but certainly as one of the first in this House, i had to explain what it was. Few people know what dual-use items, if you can call them that, actually are. The media didn't deal with it, it was uninteresting. And things that are uninteresting always provide an opportunity for groups that profit to do relatively unrecognized things. If you take that up, it's harder. But I can also remember how I then meant: Well, but these dual-use items are actually weapons, are as dangerous as weapons, are something where you have to be careful, as Mr. De Gucht looked at me a lot and said: Well, he doesn't really know, but that's quite another thing. That is why I am glad, Commissioner – and I have listened to you very carefully now – that you think that these are things that need to be addressed, because there are some problems. The first problem is that there is currently no equality of competition in Europe in terms of exports. I will speak English because I can see the Earl of Dartmouth over there, partly hidden behind his nice flag. We have nations that have quite strict rules on exports and other nations that do not have those rules. I think that the United Kingdom, for example, is a nation where they have quite strict rules and they care about those rules. There are other nations in Europe where that is not the case. So it is a disadvantage for the United Kingdom if we do not have European rules. I do not know, maybe the Earl of Dartmouth would agree with that. This is a situation that is bad. That is why this should be changed. We need uniform European rules. Of course, we must also pay attention to what falls under these rules. Until now, we always have the principle that there is a list, and anything that does not appear on the list can be exported. Is this the right approach? I do not know. Perhaps we need a catch-all approach in the future. The second is, as you have also mentioned, the question ex-ante and ex-post. Yes, of course, ex-ante costs more, but ex-post may cost lives. We have to weigh that up. And perhaps human life has to be weighed more heavily than the cost of business. The third is the large area of software. Slowly, as a European legislator, we are succeeding in bringing the software sector into these dual-use items, also in connection with human rights violations. This is extremely important. Most Leopard II tanks exported to the Middle East have not yet cost lives. European software technology has already cost a great many lives.

The malware presents itself like software that we use every day or enters through the Belgian mobile phone carrier – software not hardware – using zero-day exploits. Experts have compared Regin to Stuxnet, with which Iran’s nuclear facilities were attacked a few years ago, and found it in countries like Russia, Mexico, Saudi Arabia and Iran. And while it is popular to look to China or Russia as perpetrators of such sophisticated attacks, the research published today leads me to believe these systems may well have been made in Europe. Even if developed for intelligence services, technologies proliferate very easily. They get smaller, faster and cheaper every day. Imagine the non-state actors active in this unregulated market. All over the world these technologies help in violating human rights and harming our critical infrastructure and sensitive data.

As President, you obviously take your cue from the Chair of your group, Mr Verhofstadt, whose currency, as we saw earlier on today, is almost always abuse and not – as it should be – debate. Anyway, I would like to take the opportunity to respond to Mr Leichtfried’s very graciously-put question – and I would just point out that the distinguished colleague on my right is not a member of my group, as the President seems to think. Perhaps you will be better informed next time you chair a session of Parliament, even a comparatively minor and technical session like this. To respond to Mr Leichtfried, the United Kingdom applies its own judgement on these matters in determining what we should, or should not, export, but I – and other people in the United Kingdom – entirely respect the right of other countries to apply their own judgement on what should or should not be exported. We do not believe that this should be subbed out to the unelected Commission. The significance of dual use is that, in order to export anything on the dual-use list, businesses and exporters in the United Kingdom need to get permission from the Commission first. To be clear, despite the charming introduction from Chairman Langer, the question is misplaced.

The dual-use items often help to spy on human rights activists and are vital to keep independent opposition under control. Today there is a clear need to make sure that export control mechanisms are up to date and more efficient. This means effective cooperation with researchers and also the private sector. Such cooperation also has to address the growing threat of the intangible transfer of technologies. I would like to commend the Commission’s review of last April on the export control policy, which outlines the main shortcomings and proposes strategic lines for the future. I think the meaning of today’s debate is to support and speed up a legislative proposal to update the existing dual-use regulation. It should also provide incentives for all Member States to join, for example, the Wassenaar Arrangement, because behind the  widespread misuse of these dual-use items there is a much deeper issue at stake – the credibility of the EU, which is above all based on common values and fairness. The continuing practice of dual-use items ending up in the hands of repressive regimes is distorting and undermining our moral foundations in favour of pragmatic, short-sighted gains to expand one’s markets by any means. There is an urgent need to establish an efficient embargo on exports of dual-use goods and technologies to countries that are targeted by the EU sanctions, for example Russia, from where the items in question can be transferred to separatists.

That is why it is essential to pay the utmost attention to the Commission's regulatory effort on dual-use products, and the legislative proposal must in any case be speeded up.

First of all, account must be taken of the need to eliminate all threats arising from the misuse of certain products, but at the same time we must avoid a distortion of the market leading to a loss of competitiveness of European producers for the benefit of others whose regulation is less transparent. Secondly, restrictions must be based on stringent controls both ex ante and ex post, and action must be taken at the same time to minimise the barriers that still exist in the European market, identifying the most effective measures to support control action for the most sensitive areas.

The sale of telecommunications systems is, of course, completely uncontroversial to some countries, but it can be a complete disaster to others. It may be the same with some consulting services. We must therefore introduce a system that looks not only at the product as such, but also at the recipient country. Is it a democracy, respectfor human rights, is there a risk that the country will end up in a conflict internally or externally? That can change very quickly, as we saw, for example, at the Arab Spring. We must also learn from the mistakes we made, where several EU countries have actually sold both armaments and surveillance equipment to North Africa and the Middle East.

Attention: we are not talking here about weapons, but about products that are born for civil use and that are therefore much more devious, because they are not subject to the same restrictions, but can also contribute to human rights violations in the world.  Unfortunately, Europe is a teacher of hypocrisy in this area too, and while the Eu ropean Union has acceded to the European Convention on Human Rights, it exports surveillance equipment, radar systems and technological components that can also be used against our own interests. While Europe is full of fine words about world peace, European countries sold chemicals to Syria in 2013, with the express consent of their national authorities – substances officially intended for civilian use, but which may have been used in the manufacture of chemical weapons. It is therefore obvious that there is a need for better control over Member States and dual-use products in order to establish, once and for all, what is legitimate to export and to whom.

This needs to be addressed. Export control is not the only way to address this – we need to do more. I tried to outline how we have done a few things, and we are now in a very cautious, listening mood in order to see how we can update and review the current legislation. We have put forward a communication; there are some ideas. We are also listening very much to what industry says, to what Member States say, to what you say and, of course, to what the different NGOs – which are very active – say. They perfectly agree with you that a few years ago this was not an issue, but now there is greater awareness, and we should use that. Regulations have been amended, policy has advanced, people are more aware, but we also need to make sure that we have controls that are updated.  It is complicated, though. We need to make sure that we get this right so that we target what we do not want to see and do not harm European exports for good purposes. That is why we are now preparing the review. As I said, we have listened to the concerns of many different experts, and we hope that we can strike a careful balance in our proposal, which will come – hopefully – next year.

We need to deliver on growth and jobs; we need to make sure that we do not burden our citizens and our enterprises with undue regulation; we need to make sure that we deliver what is necessary so that Europe can use the existing opportunities in the economy that we are not using today. I believe that we as institutions – the three of us: Commission, Parliament and Council – have a responsibility when we create legislation to assess whether that legislation achieves the goals it needs to achieve and nothing more and nothing less. That is why I strongly believe in impact assessment at out outset, when the Commission is preparing its work. That is why I believe we need to make improvements both in the way we do our impact assessment as a Commission and by putting the Impact Assessment Board in a position to do its work. However, I also believe that we have a joint responsibility, with the European Parliament and the Council, to improve the impact assessment along the way because, at the end of the day, what has an impact is not the initial proposal but rather the outcome at the end of the legislative procedure, and all of us know that this is not necessarily the same thing. So what we need to do – and I know that Parliament feels strongly about this and is working on it – is to try to improve the process and ensure that the three institutions do more in terms of impact assessment along the way, so that when we have the final say about a directive, for example, before it is translated into national legislation, we have a clear view of the impact of what we finally decide to do, and of how to ensure that what it does is precisely what it is intended to do and not more than that. As I said at my hearing, I have a very special interest in helping small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe to use the opportunities they have. From various studies I know of, and also through the contacts I have had with impact assessment authorities in Member States, it is increasingly clear to me that removing some of the administrative burden or undue regulation from small and medium-sized enterprises can have a catalytic effect on employment and on fighting unemployment in the European Union. Just imagine, for argument’s sake, that we can lift the burden of administration from a baker or a butcher by 10%. I am convinced that even that 10% could make the difference between a baker or a butcher being able to hire an extra hand and that same baker or butcher having to close the business because there is no time to see to all the administration. These things can yield huge results because, given the number of small enterprises in the European Union, helping them helps the growth of employment more than anything else. I want to remind you that 85% of jobs in the private sector in the European Union are in small and medium-sized enterprises. Helping those enterprises by lifting some of the administrative burden – by making sure when we legislate for them that the legislation achieves the goal we intend and nothing more than that – is a direct contribution to creating more employment in the European Union. I am dead set on this goal. I am ready to come to you and be accountable for it, but I desperately need your support because when Parliament acts in terms of impact assessment it makes a huge contribution to attaining that goal. We cannot do this on our own as a Commission. We need Parliament, and I hope that the Commission and Parliament together can convince the Council to pick up this issue too, because up to now the Council, to put it mildly, has not been very active in following suit where Parliament and the Commission want to achieve results.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 156, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Markus PIEPER", "mepid": "28224", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I would like to thank the commissioner for his work and for his work Small and medium-sized enterprises are important to us, they are the backbone of the economy, and we must not overburden them with bureaucracy.

Why have the Directors-General been given much more discretion as to whether or not there should be an impact assessment? These are already very specific questions.

We have these expert groups in many European countries – Sweden, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, the United Kingdom – and also in Germany, independent bodies assess the competence and the bureaucratic consequences of national legislation. Why not also an impact assessment of the legislative proposals, independent of the Commission in Brussels? It is not intended to replace the Commission's work on this, let alone restrict its right of initiative. Nor do we want a mooch that interferes extensively with the legislative procedures.

Quantitative indicators are needed, but also qualitative indicators. We need to understand that public policies affect citizens and that the people and different social actors involved need to know why we want to implement a particular policy and what the results will be.

Mr President, assessing the impact of European Union legislation is a very important activity which must, first of all, be carried out in the political field, because the Commission must examine whether the principle of subsidiarity is being respected. This is a very important political issue concerning the very competences of the European Union, the protection of the principle of givers of powers and the protection of compliance with the presumption of competence in favour of the Member States. This is the first element that the European Commission should consider. The second is respect for fundamental rights. These are very important issues which involve many problematic and many individual aspects. The third issue concerns the impact on small and medium-sized enterprises which really need to be taken very seriously. I will tell you, for example, what is happening in Greece, where the memorandum is being implemented and where no control and no assessment of the economic and social impact has been carried out, where we have thousands of unemployed, where we have thousands of poor Greeks. Commissioner, I want to tell you what happened to small and medium-sized enterprises, because the Commission is a member of the troika. Two hundred and thirty thousand businesses have been closed. There was a 75% reduction in turnover. Tax obligations cannot be fulfilled. 46% of small and medium-sized enterprises delay payments. If you had made an assessment of the social and economic impact, we might have had different results. We must also have an impact assessment for technological development because without technology we cannot move on to the new production model.

We wanted a reduced administrative burden, but we kept increasing it. We wanted simpler legislation, but it has become less simple. We are not consistent, and basically we are placing more of a burden on our businesses and our citizens than we should do, without reaching or aiming for better objectives. For me, better regulation is a top priority. I have dealt with the subject in the past, both from an administrative perspective and in speaking to – and working a lot with – businesses. If you talk to them today, most of them will identify this as the number one or number two issue. I very much agree with the Commission Vice-President here: if we could reduce the administrative burden by 10-15%, we would, in fact, have GDP growth roughly 1% higher than we have today. So it is a significant issue with significant implications for growth and for employment. Now this is not an issue just for the Commission. The Commission has made progress, but it can make more. The Council – I will be blunter than the Vice-President was – has done zero. Parliament has made progress, but we need more progress. I would go so far as to say that this is an issue for an interinstitutional agreement, perhaps to be looked at in the future. I would like to see impact assessment as a key issue and as a key building block in better regulation. I would like to see independently-carried-out impact assessments, professionally done. I would like experts and professionals on board. I would like to see the highest possible degree of independence, and I would like the Vice-President to supervise all these activities. I would even like to see financial targets. Perhaps that is very ambitious, but we know that it has worked elsewhere in the world, notably in the USA, and in some Member States. Having spoken to the Vice-President, my questions are similar to those asked by Mr Pieper, so I will not repeat them.

When I look at what Businesseurope has just done today, this has nothing to do with better regulation, it is the destruction of future opportunities for our economy through deregulation. In this context, it is also important that impact assessment remains an inclusive instrument, that we do not postpone the agenda. We must take the costs into account, but we must also take into account the benefits of regulation. We must also take into account what new markets may emerge. All this must be done in context. Secondly, this so-called group of experts, which the Stoiber Commission has proposed, is something where we should not be stumbling, but should work very carefully. I would like to point out that the representatives of consumer interests, health interests, environmental interests and trade unions in the Stoiber Group have distanced themselves from these proposals. We need to discuss it carefully. We do not need a bureaucratic de-bureaucratisation loophole, and we must not reduce stakeholder participation in such a way that only a few are heard.

Zero growth, deindustrialization, programmed death of our agriculture and fisheries, endemic unemployment, loss of purchasing power, failure of the school system and initial and vocational training, uncontrolled immigration, corruption at all levels and increasing insecurity, levelling down, loss of values, I happen and the worst. However, it is true, and it is clearly explained, that each impact assessment contributes to the decision but does not replace it.

And we must not forget that they occupy 70% of the workers in the European Union. In this sense, it is therefore essential to always keep in mind the principle of thinking first on a small scale, which we leave embodied in the small business act. We must not forget that SMEs are the true engine of the European economy, as I said, and account for, for example, in Spain, 99.8% of all companies. They are a source of employment and wealth creation, so facilitating their activity should be one of the premises that guide our political action. The Commission's commitment to periodically review impact assessment standards in order to improve them is therefore a step in the right direction, but perhaps not sufficient.

Secondly, let me take away any misunderstanding. The impact assessment on SMEs was, is and will remain part of the Commission’s impact assessment. The only thing I want to do is to improve that. I do not think it is good enough as it is. To explain the way it works: the services of the Commission who prepare legislation are themselves responsible for impact assessment. This impact assessment is then reviewed by the Impact Assessment Board, and until now approximately 40% of what was presented to the Board was sent back because it was not good enough and had to be reviewed. So I am fully conscious of the fact that the Commission services should do a better job at incorporating impact assessment when they draft legislation. What we are doing now is revising the guidelines so that we do a better job. Your contribution tonight is extremely valuable for me to make sure that I can put that into the debate to create better guidelines. The assumption that impact assessment would not be done for SMEs is not corroborated by the facts. Approximately 93% of the proposals have an entire or partial impact assessment for SMEs. I also believe that we could improve the Impact Assessment Board by making sure that we expand the membership of that Board with people who have experience in this field, who are clearly independent and who are willing to be very clear and brutal if they believe that the Commission is not doing a good job. My intention is to look very carefully at the composition of the Impact Assessment Board. Some of you have suggested that this Impact Assessment Board should be removed from the Commission. I am not of that opinion. I believe it should remain within the Commission, because what we do is assess drafts we make in the Commission before these drafts go to Parliament and the Council. So if you want impact assessment across the board for EU legislation, perhaps we could then have a talk with Parliament on how Parliament organises this and learn from each other and then also look at what the Council could still be doing. Impact assessment means looking at the impact on society in a broad sense. It is not just about whether it is legally well-drafted legislation. It also looks at the economic impact of this legislation. It looks at the social impact of this legislation. It looks at the environmental impact of this legislation. This is all of extreme importance for better regulation. Mr Telička suggested that perhaps we should also have financial targets. Well, let me say – and this is for better regulation, not for impact assessment, and I think it was also Mr Bütikofer who referred to that – that better regulation does not mean deregulation or less regulation. Better regulation can mean replacing 28 national regulations by one clear EU regulation, but it can also mean that the EU refrains from making regulations where perhaps the differences between the Member States are so big that if you make an EU regulation, it becomes so complicated that it is too much of a burden, especially on small and medium-sized enterprises. I want to take a completely rational approach to the issue. For me this is not an ideological issue, a party political issue; for me this is a rational issue. How do we attain the goals of sustainable growth in Europe without an undue burden on citizens and enterprises? That is the main goal of my operation in the next five years. I also believe that we need to review existing legislation. We have not been very good at that as a European Union in the last ten years. I think Mr Telička rightly pointed to that problem, and I really undertake to have a dialogue with this Parliament on how we can also remove outdated legislation or legislation that no longer attains the goals it was intended for. I agree with those of you who say ʽthink small firstʼ. Indeed, not just because there are so many SMEs in the EU, but also because helping SMEs is actually easier across the board than helping the big guys, because if you help SMEs remove just a part of the burden they have, you could create tremendous results in a very short period of time. But the SMEs have to be aware of this, and until now my impression is that whatever we have done at the European level, SMEs today do not have the feeling that we are taking the burden away from them. They have the feeling, as some of you rightly pointed out, that the only thing Europe does is add more burden to them, and we should be very aware of that feeling in European society, and we should be able to do something concretely about this jointly as the Commission/European Parliament. To sum up, Madam President: yes, SMEs will remain as part of impact assessment. Yes, we need to do better in impact assessment than we have done in the last couple of years. Yes, this is part of the better regulation exercise that will be complicated but necessary for growth in the European Union; and yes, the Commission is strongly committed to making sure that all stakeholders, and especially this Parliament, have a full say in how we develop this, and I hope that this can be reflected in the new guidelines the Commissions will be developing shortly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 182, "date": "2014-11-24.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.
