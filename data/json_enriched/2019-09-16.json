A life dedicated to civic commitment in the defense of democracy, in the enhancement of the political autonomy of the Azores, recognized and praised by all for its kindness, for its oratory, for its solid cultural and personal training of great ethical importance.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what is happening in the Amazon - because we are not talking about it in the past, we are talking about it in the present - massive forest fires in the Amazon region are a global problem. It is perfectly legitimate for this Parliament not only to debate it, but to speak out. What I fear very much is that, if we simply debate the situation without drawing the conclusions, I already see a number of people in the Amazon, the proponents of agribusiness, rubbing their hands and saying: finally, Europe is a tiger that does not bite. I therefore think it is important that we conclude the debate with a resolution which clearly states, from our point of view, the consequences that the European Union should draw if Brazil remains in its position today, which is essentially to say that there is no problem and that, ultimately, the Europeans only have to meddle in what concerns them. I think the case of the Amazon is a concern for all of us. It is not just a world heritage, it is an essential part of the fight against climate change and we cannot leave the current situation without consequences.

This hearing took place, Mrs Lagarde made herself available to debate long hours with us and therefore, from that point of view - the rules were respected and these rules stipulate that, in fact, the vote will then be put to the plenary. Nevertheless, I would like to draw the plenary's attention to the fact that Mrs Lagarde has shown that, in principle, she agrees to come to the plenary, which the rules do not oblige her to do.  I think that if this Parliament wants to take this opportunity to improve its profile by having a debate with the candidate for the presidency of the Central Bank, that is a good thing. Mrs Lagarde, I think, had good reason to be in Washington: the General Assembly of the International Monetary Fund is preparing and so I do not take her absence here as a sign of disrespect. However, it is true that if tomorrow the debate cannot be held in its presence, it does not make much sense to hold it.  So, for reasons quite opposite to Mr Bay's, I think it might make sense - but only if it is consensual in this Parliament - to hold the debate and vote in October I, but if we want to present this as an act of defiance towards Mrs Lagarde, then obviously we do not agree with those arguments.

Article 130 of the internal regulation specifies that the appointment of the President of the Central Bank must take place within two months of her hearing. However, his hearing took place on 4 September. So we have until 4 November to appoint the President of the European Central Bank and we have two sessions in October. This could allow us to have a calm and healthy debate with Mrs Lagarde, as can be expected from a monetary policy and a new President of the European Central Bank. I remember her hearing where she said that the European Central Bank had listened to the market for far too long and that it was time to listen to the peoples of Europe.

I am taking this point this afternoon on behalf of my colleague Commissioner Hogan. I want to thank you for the opportunity to contribute to this issue and I welcome the interest of Parliament in forests.  Forests, covering 40% of the European Union’s land surface, are a precious resource for our society, environment and economy and must play a very important role in addressing the sustainability challenges ahead. They are also affected by climate change and associated extreme events like storms or forest fires, which generate additional management challenges. In April this year, Commissioner Hogan organised a European Union conference on forests where we had the opportunity to discuss in depth the current challenges of the European Union’s forests and the forest-based sector. This was a very fruitful event, which had the participation of all relevant stakeholders: policymakers, administrators, researchers, forest—owner representatives, the forest industry, environmental NGOs and representatives of our civil society. The conference confirmed the growing relevance and importance of forests and the forest-based sector in the context of the Paris Agreement, the global biodiversity targets and achieving the SDGs, while also underpinning the importance of forests for new and future-proof economic opportunities in rural areas. Forests and forest-based products are crucial for achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, by constituting carbon sinks and by substituting fossil-based materials, as proposed in the political guidelines of the President-elect. You have asked the Commission to present an assessment of the situation of European Union forests. Let me start by saying that forest policy is primarily the responsibility of the Member States. This is well reflected in the European Union forest strategy and the recent Council conclusions of March 2019 on the review of the strategy that confirmed the subsidiarity—based approach on forestry policy at European Union level.  In the last few years, forests across the European Union have been increasingly subject to several extreme events such as storms, droughts and pests – often seen as consequences of climate change – which are responsible for great losses in the forest economy and the associated ecosystems. The recent large-scale bark beetle outbreaks in many European countries add to the effects of forest fires, storms and windstorms and other pests. The Commission chairs dedicated expert groups – the Standing Forestry Committee, the Coordination Group for Biodiversity and Nature, the Forest Fires Expert Group – to address these issues and facilitate regular exchange of information and good practice between Member States and the Commission. For instance, recent dedicated discussions have addressed the bark beetle situation in the Standing Forestry Committee in December 2018 and guidance on fire prevention-oriented management of forested landscapes in the Forest Fires Expert Group in November 2018. Forest protection and resilience will also be discussed in next week’s Coordination Group for Biodiversity and Nature. An example of the magnitude of impacts is the large-scale mortality of Norway spruce forests in central Europe caused by bark beetle outbreaks, estimated at 80-82 million m3 for 2018. For Germany, the losses of forests as a result of bark beetle outbreak and the drought during the last two years is estimated to have resulted in more than 100 000 hectares of forests being seriously damaged. Concerning forest fires, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS) more than 300 000 hectares of forest burnt down by early September 2019, in 1 880 fires. This figure is more than 60 000 hectares larger than the 2008-2018 average. In total, it is estimated that up to four million hectares of forested areas in Europe are affected by forest damage. This damage is causing significant effects in European forest ecosystems, within and outside Natura 2000, and in the forest-based industry. The current situation on the European roundwood market is beyond comparison: driven by damaged wood from droughts, heat, windstorms and floods, and bark beetle infestation, the market is flooded in terms of volume, and market prices are dropping. The situation is far from optimal from the point of view of climate change mitigation through harvested wood products. In order to support forests and the forest sector’s needs, the European Union Forest Strategy achieved the alignment of the European Union funding instruments in support of a commonly agreed set of objectives and priorities, building on the key principles of sustainable forest management, multifunctionality and resource efficiency.  The common agricultural policy (CAP) is the main source of financial support for European Union forests. The planned public expenditure for 2014-2020 is about EUR eight billion, spread across 90% of the rural development programmes. Other EU funds, such as the cohesion policy, the civil protection mechanism, the LIFE financial instrument, or the research framework programme, consistently support the European Union objectives for forests. Support for the prevention of damage to forests caused by fires, natural disasters and extreme events, and for the restoration of production potential, is also available to Member States through the European Union’s rural development policy. For the period 2014-2020, fire and natural disaster prevention and restoration account for over 20% of the planned CAP expenditure on forests, including EUR 1.7 billion for prevention, and EUR 700 million for restoration. Additionally, an amount of EUR 1.5 billion is programmed for ensuring the long-term resilience of forests. The European Union civil protection mechanism has also been providing ample technical support to disaster prevention and preparedness, and means to help fight disasters such as forest fires. This mechanism has recently been strengthened, for example by establishing a European reserve of capacities that includes firefighting planes and helicopters. Moreover, we are also committing substantial support for research and innovation in the forest-based sector under Horizon 2020, including for the protection of forests and new practices and approaches to enhance forest resilience. We expect that the budget will be substantially increased under Horizon Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 1, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 25, "date": "2019-09-16.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which The forest is an important climate protection ist in Europe; this is particularly true if the forest is also managed and the wood can replace other products such as steel and cement. It is also important for a large economic sector, for recovery and for biodiversity. The forest is in poor condition in many countries in Europe, for example in the Czech Republic, Slovakia, France, Germany and southern Scandinavia. The cause is obviously the extreme drought of the last two years and thus the spread of pests such as the bark beetle. So, in short, a key climate activist is at risk, probably because of climate change.

The reason why this is the case is perhaps because there is nothing like a European forest, we only have European forests in plural and some of them are doing quite well and others are doing worse. In order for us to understand what is actually going on, perhaps we should look at what has happened in recent years in both Canada and Russia. There have been huge forest fires in both countries. In fact, Canada's forest resources are already negative in ecological terms precisely because huge forest fires have released so much CO2 into the air. The reason for this is simple: when nature starts a forest fire, there is no way to put out it. There are no forest roads, there is no possibility of extinguishing, which is why the problem remains permanent. In Russia, we have exactly the same situation: in July, four million hectares of forest were burned there and no one was able to put out. The fact that we take care of the forests requires forest roads. It requires what Donald Trump said a little erdually that we're going to go for a bit of a rake. It's not that small a rake, it's really hard work. But without forest management, we will not solve this problem. Nor is we the bark beetle problem, known as the book-workshop, which is currently spreading quite badly in southern Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 28, "date": "2019-09-16.json", "name": "Bas EICKHOUT", "mepid": "96725", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, thank you for this debate on European forests because we talk quite often about forests outside Europe, but I think it’s very important to talk about the state of our forests within the EU as well, especially because forests are very crucial for climate. They are a natural carbon sink and they are key for biodiversity – and on both matters Europe is not performing well.  First of all on climate: 40% of our current renewables come from biomass and in the Commission’s own impact assessment for the LULUCF Directive, it clearly states that we expect a decline in our sink in the future until 2030, and a decline in the sink is the same effect as higher emissions. So we have to look and do better there also, in forestry as a sink. But also on biodiversity: the Environmental Assessment Agency clearly states that the state of our forests is only at 25% of the favourable status in Natura 2000, in protected areas. So we expect action from the Commission in its climate law to improve the natural carbon sinks and a binding biodiversity strategy for 2030 in order to improve our forests for climate and biodiversity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2019-09-16.json", "name": "Teuvo HAKKARAINEN", "mepid": "197596", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group. – Mr President, there was a small mistake, but Mr Torvalds has already left.

In forests, for example, forest roads have been made to get the forests managed, as well as to prevent fires. We are at the same latitude as Russia, Canada and Sweden. There were large forest fires in Sweden not long ago, but the Finns managed to prevent them. Because Finland lives in the forest, it also knows how to manage its forests so that they grow. Now that we are concerned about the forests of Europe, come and see how it is handled in Finland.  Personal experience I have of it.

The state of our forests should become one of the key challenges for decades to come. In recent years, we have been observing with concern the process of destroying forests: fires, illegal logging, parasites, even a bark beetle. Globally, the area of forests has decreased over the last ten years, although fortunately the Union is not doing badly against this background. In Poland, the area of forests is steadily increasing from 20% of the country's area in 1946 to 30% today. And we are planning further growth. Polish State Forests are a very good example of forest management. I think we should exchange good practices. Every year, 500 million trees are planted in Poland. In total, it is almost 60 thousand hectares of renewals and afforestation. Unfortunately, the Union often does not encourage Member States to afforestation, and that was the case, I ask you, in the case of LULUCF in the previous term of office, when the role of active forest management in reducing emissions was underestimated.

And yet forests and trees have a very prominent role in climate protection and biodiversity: trees and forests are like a green lung, and for this and to do so, sustainable forestry is of paramount importance. Forests can only play the role of climate protection if the wood is also harvested, that is, if the forest is also used, and if, in the end, the wood is also used to produce building materials or also to produce energy. This commitment by forest farmers to sustainability and sustainable forestry must be rewarded, and we must do everything we can to get the forest farmers to keep the European forest alive, to preserve it sustainably, so that this forest can also fulfil its many functions in the fight against climate change.

However, Commissioner, we cannot stop. The cuts in the common agricultural policy in the Commission's proposal mean, in some countries, a heavy reduction in rural development programmes: in some countries it will be 25 % cut, and this is certainly an unacceptable step backwards.

While forest management is a policy within the competences and obligations of the Member States, it is important to note once again and repeat the European Union's forest strategy, which should serve as a talking point for coordinating national policies as well. About 50% of Europe's area is forest areas, which accounts for about 5% of the world's forest fund. While europe is not such a large and significant forest fund globally, the cliché that they are the green lungs of the planet and we need to take care of them is true. Although global trends are for forest areas to decrease, in the Union they continued to grow and increased by around 11 million hectares by 2010. I believe that everyone present in the chamber agrees on the vital importance that forests have on nature conservation and biodiversity, climate change mitigation and the fight to save individual regions.

The amount of timber harvested has doubled in the last thirty years, but without compromising forest resources in the country, as evidenced by the steady increase in forest area. Today, forestry in Poland is almost thirty percent. In this situation, it has become good that forests have finally been integrated by the May 2018 Regulation of Parliament and the Council into the climate and energy policy framework, which means that the removal of CO2 emissions from forests will finally be taken into account in the emission balances of individual EU countries. This will have a positive impact on forestry development after 2020. Unfortunately, climate change is adversely affecting forests in Europe: high temperatures, long periods of drought, snowless winters and extreme weather events such as hurricane winds, as well as pest infesting, including in particular the printer's bark beetle, are causing enormous damage, which requires the support of forest management.

It is clear that a managed forest helps more against climate change than a forest that is left to its own devices. Why? On the one hand, wood permanently binds carbon as a building material, on the other hand, sustainable management primarily ensures healthy trees and thus maximum CO2 absorption capacity. Poorly managed forests, on the other hand, are the losers of climate change. Not only are they prone to droughts, but they are also a burden on pests. Therefore, sustainable and active forestry is a guarantee for healthy forests and their high CO2 absorption capacity. In order to be able to pursue these objectives, I am committed to further developing the European forest strategy, which calls for new, but above all healthy, forests. I look forward to working together. The Committee on Agriculture will also draw up proposals on this.

Before we talk about the state of forests in Europe, however, I would like to make it very clear once again why forests are so important. In the fight against climate change, there is no greater supporter than our sustainable but managed forests. CO2 is stored in wood and also in wood products. The forest must be protected, but also useful for use. Saving CO2 and safeguarding more than three million jobs across Europe is what our forest can do. It is therefore very important to me that we approach the issue in a very objective way. The climate is changing. The pressure from pests and extreme weather events takes place. In view of this, the European Commission must respond and support our forest owners and the entire forestry sector. We therefore need a new, very strong EU forestry strategy that will continue to provide clarity in the future. We cannot accept cuts to the second pillar of the agricultural budget, which also supports our forest owners. We need public money to deal with the climate change consequences in our forests.

Dear! Forests are one of the most important components of our ecosystems. Their condition depends on the ability to absorb and balance part of greenhouse gas emissions. The level of biodiversity also depends on the condition of forests. They are also part of an economy on which many European jobs are based, especially at local level. I agree with the Commission's assessment that, within the framework of the European Forestry Strategy, decisive action must be taken to help Member States, forest owners and managers to combat fires, cataclysms, diseases or forest pests. Today, we need to address this problem at European level, because individual action may not be as effective. Although I agree that this basic level should be the national level as closest as possible to this problem. This must be support at many levels, from coordination to mobilising adequate funds from the common agricultural policy or the Life programme, to supporting research and development. The forestry strategy should be reflected in Horizon Europe. The restoration of a forest substance is, on the one hand, the direction of action and, on the other hand, the strengthening of resistance to pests and atmospheric factors.

On the one hand, they are an important and significant carbon sink, but on the other hand they are also a sustainable source of raw materials. In fact, everything that is now made of oil can be made of wood in the future. It is therefore important to support innovation and product development in the sector. But now that we are talking specifically about forest damage, it is important to emphasise the role of active, sustainable forest management. Forests that are actively managed are not as sensitive to forest damage, storms and pests as untreated forests.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Barrier-free access to plant materials is a prerequisite for the innovative power of European plant breeders and our farmers, as well as for the genetic diversity of our plants. All members agreed on this at the last meeting of the Committee on Agriculture on 4 September. However, the decision of the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office in December 2018 jeopardises this barrier-free access. The members of my committee have therefore unanimously decided to send a clear political message. Allow me, as chairman of the Committee on Agriculture and Development of this House, to present the background to this question to the Commission, drawn up by the Committee on Agriculture and Development, in accordance with Rule 136 of the Rules of Procedure. In 2015, the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office ruled that products derived from essentially biological processes, such as plant seeds, natural features and genes, should be patentable. As a result of this decision, a broccoli and a tomato variety were applied for a patent. In response, Parliament adopted a resolution clarifying patent law for plants in December 2015. This is essentially Directive 98/44/EC, which grants patent protection to biotechnological inventions. The Commission stated in November 2016 that there was no intention to grant patents on natural features. All Member States have supported this interpretation. This was followed by internal powers of interpretation between the Administrative Council of the European Patent Office, which followed the Commission's line, and the Technical Board of Appeal. The latter maintained its position that the patentability of plants should be allowed. The President of the European Patent Office then applied for a final judgment from the large board of appeal of the European Patent Office, which is the highest instance. In this context, third parties are entitled to submit written observations on the facts to the Enlarged Board of Appeal. The deadline for this is 1 October 2019. The Committee on Agriculture and Development has two questions for the European Commission today. Firstly, does the Commission intend to send a written statement to the large board of appeal of the European Patent Office in order to protect the innovative capacity of the Union's plant breeding sector and the general public interest? Secondly, what measures is the Commission taking to ensure that products derived from natural processes are not patentable? Our European plant breeders and agriculture finally need clarity on their future capacity for innovation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 92, "date": "2019-09-16.json", "name": "Norbert LINS", "mepid": "124808", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much for raising this issue because, as was said, it is extremely important to have clarity there. So let me start with the second part of your question, and here the answer is rather simple. The European Commission has taken action to ensure that products resulting from natural processes are not patentable. The Commission has been in close contact both with the European Parliament, the Council, of course, the Member States, and also with the industry stakeholders in relation to the issue of the non-patentability of these products. As requested by the European Parliament in its resolution of December 2015, the Commission adopted in 2016 a notice on certain articles of the Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions. The Commission argues in the notice that plants obtained by essentially biological processes should not be patentable. The Commission notice was unanimously welcomed by the Council conclusions at the end of February 2017, and then EU Member States followed this interpretation in the national laws, and in their patent practices. Now to the first part of your question. Indeed, the Commission, representing the EU, will present so-called amicus curiae observations in the proceeding initiated by the President of the European Patent Office. This will be done before the deadline of 1 October. While the European Patent Convention is not part of Union law, it is in the European Union’s interest to avoid a conflict between the European Patent Convention and the biotechnology directive. The practical effects of the directive would be seriously compromised if the EPO can grant patents for subject matters which the directive excludes from patentability. The substance of the observation will therefore seek an interpretation of the European Patent Convention in line with the directive, as interpreted in the above-mentioned Commission notice from 2016, and thus by the European Parliament, the Council and even all 38 contracting states of the European Patent Organisation. Thus the context of the submission of the Commission will support both the innovative capacity of the European plant breeding sector and the general public interest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 93, "date": "2019-09-16.json", "name": "Annie SCHREIJER-PIERIK", "mepid": "125030", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much. As a Parliament, at the end of 2015, we clearly demanded that natural planting properties should remain freely available for the development of new varieties. We have said this, and that the patentability of plants obtained through a 'process of an essential biological nature' must be put to an end as soon as possible. This has been resolved, it seemed, at least, by correctly laying it down in implementation rule 28, paragraph 2 of the European Patent Convention, after a good statement on behalf of the Commission in 2016, as you have just said. Unfortunately, one of the multinationals challenged this and a Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office decided on 5 December 2018 that this rule would have been invalid and therefore did not apply. It is inappropriate for the Technical Chamber to try to deal with this issue itself and judged it contrary to the democratic will of the co-legislator, including of this Parliament. It is clear from this statement by the Commission that, in the creation of the European Biotechnology Directive, it was never the intention of the European Commission, the Council and Parliament to enable the patentability of natural properties, of a process of an essential biological nature, or to leave this issue open. It is therefore now imperative that the Commission, this Parliament and the Member States submit their views to the EPO Grand Chamber of Appeal as co-legislator and treaty partner in good time. It is important that we now make patents on plants obtained through an essentially biological process impossible as quickly as possible and defend the right to grow!

Mr President, with this resolution, I would like to put the patenting of plant properties obtained through classical breeding once again on the agenda. Although the European Patent Office says that it would not issue patents for the time being, there was still a legal debate as to whether or not it should be allowed. This leads to great uncertainty, but also concern among growers and citizens. Planting properties such as the red color of tomato, the taste of sweet peppers or the long stem of broccoli are common in nature. It's crazy, of course, that a company can apply for a patent on that. This is at most discovered and absolutely not invented. Not only am I morally opposed to a patent being pending, I am also very concerned about the consequences when this is possible. I see that there will be a race and that a few companies will get their hands on all the patents and that there will be a monopoly on fruit and vegetables. And that paves the way for extortionate prices on our food.  In addition, it also inhibits innovation, for example that red color of tomato. Other growers cannot continue to digest this and the result is that there is no longer any development of new crops. This is a major risk to our global food supply, as it makes crops extremely vulnerable to new diseases and new pests. I fully understand that companies are keen to commercialise their new crops, only for that is not the right instrument for patent law. The plant variety right is the right to do that.

Over the past month, the people of Hong Kong have exercised the fundamental right to demonstrate peacefully for their autonomy and the rights of freedom of expression and assembly. Throughout the summer, we invited all sides to reject all kinds of violence and to de-escalate the situation. In this sense, the announced withdrawal of the extradition bill is a step in the right direction. The people of Hong Kong have marched in unprecedented numbers and these massive demonstrations have shown their determination. It is reported that as many as 1.7 million people took to the streets on 18 August this year. In recent weeks, as the situation has escalated, there have been scenes of major violence by triads, apparent attacks on bystanders, reports of excessive use of force by the security forces, petrol bombs and wanton vandalism. All such violence is unacceptable and it cannot be condoned. Nevertheless, the protests have been predominantly peaceful and they continue to be widely supported by the population of Hong Kong. The EU has consistently supported the ‘one country, two systems’ principle. This principle, which is guaranteed in the Basic Law, is also an international commitment from China under the Sino-British Joint Declaration of 1984, as ratified by the Chinese National People’s Congress.  It gives Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and ensures respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong’s people. This principle is also crucial for business confidence in Hong Kong, a city which remains an important financial centre and a strategic port and transport hub. The ‘one country, two systems’ principle is essential for Hong Kong to continue fully to play its strategic economic role. The European Union supports the preservation of the rights and freedoms of the citizens of Hong Kong and its high degree of autonomy. This is essential for the prosperity not only of Hong Kong but also of mainland China. Respect for fundamental rights and freedoms and the independence of the judiciary are also vital for the development of Hong Kong, and for the daily lives of its people, and should be upheld in line with the Basic Law and China’s international commitments. On 18 July, the European Parliament discussed the situation in an emergency debate and you adopted the resolution. Meanwhile, the European External Action Service published three statements, and on 17 August the High Representative made the formal declaration, approved by all Member States, rejecting violence and calling for inclusive dialogue involving all key stakeholders. The High Representative discussed the situation with several international partners over the summer and released a joint statement with the Foreign Minister of Canada. Hong Kong was part of the EU Foreign Ministers’ informal discussion in Helsinki at the end of August. Since then, Chief Executive Carrie Lam has announced, on 4 September, that the extradition bill, which would have allowed extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China, will be formally withdrawn. This welcome move from the authorities potentially opens up space to work towards a peaceful and enduring solution. However, the situation remains tense. We witness with concern the rising violence in Hong Kong. We maintain our expectation that all sides should refrain from violence and seek solutions through genuine and constructive dialogue. For this to happen, it seems that, first, bold steps may be needed to restore trust. Secondly, we see that business confidence and investment sentiment are also being affected. Hong Kong is a vital bridge between the EU’s economy and China’s.

Both the fall of the Berlin Wall and the fall of the criminal communist regime has indeed opened up new perspectives for all of Europe, especially this Central and Eastern Europe to integrate fully into the European Union. Great progress has since been made. And indeed we can say that the European Union and its extension to the east has indeed been a success. European cohesion policy and European funds certainly contributed to this. Based on the principle of solidarity, european funds from the European budget have indeed enabled central and eastern European countries to be transformed in a large way and to truly co-manage the development of the western and northern Member States.
