You can submit your request to intervene in the debate by using the special keys on the electronic voting machine. Please also note that, in addition to using the electronic system, it will also be possible to submit your request in the usual practice (i.e. by raising a white sheet of paper or by making the request in person at the beginning of the debate to plenary colleagues on the catch-the-eye procedure; and by raising a blue card for the 'blue card question' procedure). This electronic system will be tested during various discussions. For this reason, I would like to remind you to always have the voting card with you so that you can use the system.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very good one. If I may give you some advice, go one block further to the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights and listen to the hearings there! I did that yesterday. This is not about resolutions, it is about people and about their freedom. Yesterday I was able to look into the eyes of Mrs Demirtaé, the woman who is fighting for her husband's freedom. Today we are not talking about Demirta', we are talking about four mayors from Turkey who have been deposed even though they have been democratically elected. Today we are talking about Adnan Seluk Mzraklé, Ahmet Türk, Bedia Özgökae. Today, however, we are talking about more than 400 other people without office and dignity who have been arrested in the same way in this wave of arrests. Today we are also talking about Canan Kaftanc'o'lu, the CHP chairman in Istanbul, who was in istanbul because of a tweet from 2012 – 2012! – has been convicted. And yes, today this resolution is also about the safety of human rights defenders, of people who stand up for other people and risk their freedom and security. For example, Veysel Ok, who was just yesterday convicted for insulting the judiciary, as a lawyer, was not allowed to insult the judiciary. However, this resolution is also about much more: relations between the EU and Turkey. How do we imagine the future of this relationship? This future is difficult, but in this future, 20% of all inmates in Turkish prisons cannot be held there on terror charges without these allegations being properly substantiated. However, this future must remain European. And that is why it is worth arguing with the Turkish Government, because turkish society is colourful, freedom-loving. It is worth fighting for their human rights. I know that not everyone agrees, but I believe that it is important to continue to defend the European perspective with Turkey. However, this perspective is built on a clear common basis, and this basis is respect for each other, but also absolute respect for human rights and the rule of law. That is what this resolution is about.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-09-19.json", "name": "Nacho SÁNCHEZ AMOR", "mepid": "197722", "text": "  Author. – Mr President, I would like to express my satisfaction at the fact that it has been easy to reach agreement on this motion for a resolution with the other groups, and I think it has been easy to reach agreement because the degree of deterioration of human rights is becoming increasingly difficult to find alibis or justifications for what is happening in Turkey. It is obvious, already to everyone, that the Turkish penal system is a device used and sometimes designed to silence political criticism. At the moment, the groups are concerned about what has happened to the government/administrative dismissal of several mayors and their replacement by the same Government, by unelected representatives appointed by the Executive. I would like to stress that these are not limitations on rights following a judicial process. No, it is the mere removal of a mayor, newly elected by his fellow citizens, by the Government, that is, by a competing party, and the appointment for that post of a representative of that same party. There is therefore no process, no judge, no guarantees. Moreover, this procedure is used to threaten other mayors, as has been the case with istanbul's social democratic mayor, who has had to win the election twice in order for power to understand that his popular support was much greater. But I would also like to point out that, in the case of these mayors of the HDP, this is not a matter of part-party solidarity, what we are doing is a defence of local democracy in Turkey, whatever the acronyms of the mayors who are affected by these situations. Look, ladies and gentlemen, there's a lot going on in Turkey. The insecurity of power to maintain control of society is increasingly obvious.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which There was indeed a local election in Turkey. The people voted, they decided. And what happened afterwards? The elected mayors were unable to carry out their duties, and the municipalities were placed under compulsory administration. Let me be very clear: this is undemocratic, it is unacceptable, and that is exactly what we must say. But not only that; the AKP government is also increasingly attacking CHP politicians. Ms. Canan Kaftanc'o'lu has already been named, the chairwoman of the CHP Istanbul, who was sentenced to almost ten years in prison for any tweets – I repeat. What a madness! At present, in Turkey, for example, more than 5,000 HDP members are behind bars: arrested journalists, opposition activists, critics. They are not doing well. One of the most well-known of these politicians is Selahattin Demirtas; Of course, that includes my solidarity. All of this is happening, and mr Erdogan is not acting out of the situation of strength at the moment, but rather out of weakness, because in the local elections we have seen quite clearly that he had a defeat, the opposition has joined forces and something can change in Turkey. But it is not only the rule of law and the issue of freedom of expression and the press in Turkey that are under threat. There is so much more. Did you know, for example, that Turkey is one of the countries with the highest number of murders of women? Did you know that Turkey has increasing numbers of rapes of children in religious institutions, that workers in Turkey die every day in industrial accidents? Did you know that there is massive repression against trade unionists, that company organisations are being prevented? All of this is vehement for us, and we need to pay more attention to it. Turkey is going through a crisis, an economic and political crisis, and these crises are mutually beneficial. All I can say, therefore, is that the population is worse off. It is all about maintaining power, mr Erdogan. Therefore, let us pay even more attention to Turkey in the coming months, and let us start with our policy. If we change our policy, let us abandon hypocrisy, let us terminate, for example, the refugee pact, because more and more people have to flee here from Turkey because they no longer have a livelihood!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2019-09-19.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   Author. – Mr President, I would like to thank all the co-drafters of this resolution for their cooperation, from which it has been made clear that we are interested in supporting the democratic forces in Turkey and about human and political rights. The government's current position goes beyond the Kurds. In the long term, the situation of the Kurds in Turkey is complicated, but what is happening there really requires our acute action, our appeal to the Turkish Government that it cannot act in this way as a member of the Council of Europe, as a member of NATO. Yes, the PKK is an organisation that even the European Union considers terrorist, but that does not mean that Turkey can apply collective guilt to all Kurdish politicians. This is simply an approach that could ultimately lead to further genocide. The Turkish government is against itself. It should try to find a way out for peaceful relations with the Kurds. And it should not violate its own laws as stated in our resolution. We list the specific names of the mayors who have been removed, replaced by mayors who are from the ruling party. But this is not just the Kurds and the HDP side. The Turkish Government is also pressuring opposition Republicans, which is why we are saying clearly that we will not accept this fact, and Erdogan must count on the fact that the opposition can win in a democratic society, that is simply normal. The opposition has rights and should have the right to exercise its mandate. And let me make one more comment. Not only the European Court of Human Rights, but there is also a new turkish embassy building at the Council of Europe and its consulate, which they certainly plan to use, but if they do not respect human rights, commitments to the Council of Europe, then this beautiful building is being built unnecessarily.

Mr President, I believe that violence, violation of human rights, terrorism inside and outside Turkey has become the norm in recent years. And I am one of those who believe that the issue of breaking the laws and rules for elected mayors is simply a continuation of many other violations that have turned Turkey into an open country of prison, violence and terrorism; a terrorism that is not only confined to Turkey but is also exported to neighbouring countries. Mr President, my whole country is suffering from violence and terrorism, human rights violations, the harsh face of the expansionist policy of occupying Turkey for forty-five years in Cyprus. And that is why today, if we really want to contribute not only with another resolution but with real work as the European Parliament and as democratically elected Members, we must thunder and send with concrete measures the message: 'Zero tolerance in Turkey!'. The European Parliament and the European Union have taken concrete measures for other countries both within the European Union and outside the European Union, without being able to do so, applying principles and values. We are not going to apply discounts and concessions to Turkey. And if we really want to do it, we all owe it – because I imagine that none of you tolerates what my country is suffering or tolerates these human rights violations – we must, I repeat, proceed to freeze Turkey's accession funds. No euros in this country that terrorizes inside and outside Turkey! No support, no help, no substantial support to all those who are really causing trouble and instability within and within Turkey!

In addition to the issue of economic exchange, the issue of migration, which we have already heard a lot about, is also extremely important the influence of Turkey on the territory of Southeast Europe, especially Bosnia and Herzegovina. Turkey has been pro-government in Bosnia and Herzegovina for years, primarily through Bosniak parties, and this is something that definitely cannot and must not be ignored in any way. Unfortunately, bosnia and herzegovina's European path is largely threatened by certain political parties there, it is threatened by those who do not respect the decisions of the Constitutional Court and who actually deny and impede the rule of law by the end of equality of one of the constituent peoples, which is Croatian. Unfortunately, such a situation also has to do with this projection of interest and power that I was talking about. As far as Turkey itself is concerned, unfortunately in recent years we have found a situation there where there is a twilight of democracy, where we actually have the advancement and degradation of fundamental human rights, democracy and the rule of law and constitutional order, and this has intensified in particular following the unsuccessful coup in 2016. We've had a situation of purges of unseaid personnel in the education system, in the media, in the judiciary, and the highlight of that is what we're talking about today, which is the dismissal of legally elected local leaders and replacing those installed from the top. Unfortunately, this degradation is not good, this degradation shows that Turkey deviates from all those principles established by the founder of the modern Turkish republic Kemal Atatürk, which are democracy, the rule of law and a modern secular state that as such has also submitted a candidacy for the European Union. In order for Turkey to remain on good terms with the European Union, so that these neighbourly relations can develop, it is essential that Turkey returns to those standards established before, that such situations of dismissal of elected officials are prevented, that Turkey returns to democracy, the rule of law and that the demographic treatment of the ruling party and its president is impeded.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2019-09-19.json", "name": "Eero HEINÄLUOMA", "mepid": "197800", "text": "   – Mr President, Turkey is indeed an extremely important neighbour to us, it is politically, economically and also in terms of public interaction.

Turkey’s local elections in March and June witnessed a voter turnout that the people of Turkey can rightly be proud of. However, ensuring that democracy goes well beyond the balloting process on voting day requires a political environment with freedom of expression and respect for plurality. It is central that elected representatives are able to exercise their political mandate freely and without fear of repression, dismissal or detention.  Following the March elections, we saw the decision to declare elected mayors ineligible to assume office and to give mayoral mandates to the candidates with the second highest number of votes. As High Representative Mogherini and Commissioner Hahn expressed, this undermines the electoral process and goes against the core aim of ensuring that the will of the people prevails. The respect for democratic outcomes was further put into question with the suspension last month of the mayors of the cities of Mardin, Van and Diyarbakir, who were replaced by state governors. This deprives voters of political representation at local level and seriously damages democracy.  Turkey must repeal measures that inhibit local democracy. This follows clearly from the recommendations of the Venice Commission and from Turkey’s obligations as a member of the Council of Europe. As we have said to the Turkish authorities multiple times, we are conscious of Turkey’s security challenges and its right to fight terrorism. However, those security challenges cannot justify dismissals for political reasons, applying broad anti-terror or criminal legislation. Unfortunately, the negative developments in the rule of law are not limited to the recent local elections. There are still a large number of journalists, writers, academics, politicians and human rights defenders in detention in Turkey, for instance, Osman Kavala, who has been detained for almost two years, or Selahattin Demirtaş whose case was heard yesterday by the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. We’ve also seen a dramatic increase in prosecutions for insulting the President, as exemplified by the case of Canan Kaftancioğlu. The European Union has consistently called upon Turkey to ensure the respect of fundamental freedoms in accordance with Turkey’s obligations as a candidate country and as a member of the Council of Europe. This is not just about Turkey’s status as a candidate country. It is also about the kind of country Turkish citizens want and deserve, a country with stronger institutions, a more inclusive country and a country where they can all find their place and contribute to Turkish society’s collective progress. In the European Union we will continue to work to support a strong, free, safe, prosperous and democratic Turkey as a key neighbour and partner in our region, not just as a candidate country. It is in our shared interest to contribute to this and all Turkish citizens should know that they can count on the European Union.

This is not a crisis that began with the exodus in August 2017: over a million Rohingya refugees have fled violence in Myanmar in successive waves of displacement since the early 1990s. The vast majority of those who have fled and reached Bangladesh are women and children, and more than 40% are under age 12. Many walked for days through the forest to reach safety, including pregnant women, young children, the sick and the elderly. Too many children are growing up in Kutupalong and Nayapara refugee camps in the Cox’s Bazar district. The refugee settlement has become the largest refugee camp in the world, with more than 600 000 people living in an area of just 13 km2. For many children, those are the only places they have ever known, and they are vulnerable to disease and lack sufficient access to education. This is heart—breaking. The world that is watching owes these children a duty of care. We all remember that in 2018 the UN independent fact—finding mission concluded that crimes against humanity and possibly genocide had been committed against the Rohingya. In its further report in 2019 the UN fact—finding mission reported severe ongoing sexual and gender—based violence, including systematic rape, gang rape and forced sexual acts by the Myanmar military and security forces against Rohingya women, children and transgender people. Yet, the authorities in Myanmar refused to investigate seriously human rights violations against Rohingya and to hold the perpetrators accountable. Not only that, Myanmar continues to deny that these rights violations ever occurred in the first place – claims that are contradicted by extensive good-quality evidence and individual witness accounts. The highest-ranking military, who supervised the attacks against the Rohingya population, remain in their posts. Myanmar has so far refused to allow a UN Human Rights Council fact—finding mission to enter the country. Despite the Government of Myanmar having withdrawn cooperation with the UN special rapporteur, the special rapporteur continues to seek to engage and assist with human rights issues. So it is high time for action. The Council has prolonged its restrictive measures in place in Myanmar for one year. These measures include asset freezes and travel bans on 14 senior military and other security officials of Myanmar. The decision of the International Criminal Court to open a preliminary investigation into crimes, under the court’s jurisdiction, committed against the Rohingya population is a welcome step towards accountability.

There are now more than one million Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar, making it the largest refugee camp in the world. This is a major refugee crisis with a significant risk of radicalisation inside the camps. The situation inside the camps is deteriorating. More than 500 000 children remain without access to education. The prospects for a rapid return of the refugees into Myanmar, in a safe, dignified and voluntary manner, are increasingly unlikely. This was shown by the failure of the recent second attempt for the repatriation of 3 450 refugees, since no one agreed to return to Myanmar due to the lack of conditions conducive for returns. The situation, in addition to being an urgent humanitarian crisis, is evolving into a longer-term political and security challenge. Therefore, we need to intensify discussions on the prospects for refugees, the Cox’s Bazar security situation, the livelihood and education opportunities in the camps, the access to health and justice, the impact on the host communities and, of course, the Joint Response Plan funding. The European Union will continue to call for sustainable solutions for the Rohingya, and for the Myanmar authorities to ensure that conditions are met for safe, dignified and voluntary returns. This can be achieved only by implementing the recommendations of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, which the Government of Myanmar has endorsed. These issues were raised with the Myanmar Government at the Human Rights Dialogue held in Yangon in June 2019, co-chaired by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore. Within the ongoing Everything But Arms enhanced monitoring, and all relevant bilateral meetings, the European Union is urging Myanmar to contribute to the creation of conditions conducive to the safe, voluntary and dignified return of Rohingya refugees to their place of origin.

It is a peaceful sign for women's rights, which I must say is sometimes too peaceful for myself. Actually – because on 8 March this year, women in Iran, in Tehran, gave flowers in the Metro. In Tehran, the first and last compartments are reserved for women in the metro, and three women took off their veils there and expressed their concerns very clearly. You said: I hope that one day we will be able to march together on the streets of Tehran in Iran, with and without a veil, because there is enough space in Iran for all Iranians. A video shared on social media shows women hugging with and without veils as there is applause. The tension and also a feeling of awakening are really felt. And what was the Iranian regime's reaction? Incarceration, harassment, imprisonment up to 24 years. And that is not the only case. Nasrin Sotudeh, who received the Sakharov Prize from us here in Parliament, was herself sentenced to 33 years and 148 lashes for defending women like the one in the Metro in court. These punishments show us one thing very clearly: the Iranian regime feels threatened by these courageous women. Yes, the situation in the region is truly complicated, and it has become even more complicated in recent days.

The last three women convicted were for a video that went viral on March 8, in which, taking off their veils, they handed out flowers and told women that they wished they could walk together in Iran, some with a veil, some without him, but as a result of a free and own decision. This was her crime, a crime considered an attack on national security, for which they have been sentenced to more than twenty-three years in prison, in a trial without guarantees, without having access to the choice of lawyer.

They will defend their right, their freedom and the future of their daughters. That is why it is important today that this Parliament sends a very clear message.

Journalists, lawyers and activists are constantly facing harassment, arrests and prosecution for their peaceful work. With this resolution, the European Parliament is calling upon Iran to suppress all these sentences and immediately and unconditionally release all human rights defenders and all EU-Iran dual nationals who are arbitrarily detained. Three Iranian women appeared in a video while protesting against the compulsory wearing of veils. The protest was peaceful and advocated for women’s right to choose whether to wear the hijab or not. These three women have been convicted and sentenced to between 16 and 23 years’ imprisonment. The authorities reasoned that they were acting against national security and promoting moral corruption and prostitution. This case is a clear example of an extremely disproportionate punishment. Moreover, these women were arrested although they were solely exercising their right of freedom of expression – one of the core rights of every human being. In another case, an Iranian woman set herself on fire in protest at her arrest because she wanted to watch a football match in a stadium. Besides this violation of women’s rights, the joint resolution also reacts to Iranian measures taken against several EU-Iran dual nationals. These persons have been arrested on the basis of vague or unspecified charges and sentenced without a fair trial. It is clear that Iran is severely violating human rights, and we – as a democratic body that represents those imprisoned European citizens – have a moral duty to support them and to react in a resolute manner. This House is constituted to protect all European citizens wherever they are. Iran is one of the founding states of the United Nations, and has ratified multiple legally binding treaties under international law, focusing on respect for human rights. However, reality shows that they don’t respect these obligations.

One of the last alarming cases is the tragic death of the twenty-nine-year-old Sahar Jodayarí, who decided to set himself on fire in the face of a possible six-month prison sentence for attempting to enter a football match disguised as a man. Iran is the only country in the world that forbids women from entering stadiums, but of course this is by no means the only discrimination. Since January last year, at least thirty-two people have been arrested, and ten imprisoned for protesting against the wearing of the mandatory veil, which is a manifest violation of their right to manifest themselves as an exercise of freedom of expression. We therefore demand the release of all persons arbitrarily detained and imprisoned for exercising their fundamental rights. Moreover, Iranian women remain strongly discriminated against on issues of personal status related to marriage, divorce, inheritance and the issue of children, and are marginalized economically. Discrimination in the public and private sectors must come to an end. We hope that our call today, from here, will help the European Union and its Member States to prioritize the protection of human rights defenders in Iran.

We can't put that aside because now we need the nuclear plan to succeed.

It is sanctions, not words, that are needed or Iran will be emboldened further. But the names of just some of those languishing in Iranian prison cells need to be spoken.

Unfortunately, in too many countries, including Iran, women continue to face threats and abuse because they are human rights defenders or simply because they are women. They receive defamatory comments and slander. They face hatred, harassment, intimidation and incitement to violence, often of a sexual nature, or they face imprisonment for standing up for their basic rights. In this context, I would like to express how deeply saddened I am by the fate of Sahar Khodayari, who earlier this month set herself on fire after learning that she faced a prison sentence for trying to attend a football match, and who died in the hospital from her wounds. Her tragic death is the heart-breaking aftermath of an appalling contempt for women’s rights. No woman should fear imprisonment for attending a sporting event.  Every year, on 8 May, the international community marks International Women’s Day. For the European Union, this is a time to pay tribute to acts of courage and determination by ordinary women around the world who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities. In the joint statement that the EU published on 8 May this year, we stated that we are committed to giving all women and girls equal access to health services, education and economic empowerment and opportunities to shape their own future. We will never stop fighting for true equality for all, inside and outside the European Union, to make sure that progress achieved is not undone. Our commitment to support human rights defenders, including women’s rights defenders, also applies to our work in Iran. In the context of the regular, high-level political dialogue with Iran that aims to advance bilateral cooperation in a number of areas of mutual interest, the European Union has been consistently raising issues of human rights. We have regularly engaged with the authorities to demand that human rights defenders, including women, must not be subjected to harassment or detention.  We have been vocal in this demand, for instance in the case of the 2012 Sakharov Prize laureate Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was sentenced to long periods of imprisonment because of her advocacy for fundamental human rights. And we continue to be vocal, including in international fora such as the United Nations Human Rights Council. The rights of women and girls are also likely to figure prominently during Iran’s upcoming Universal Periodic Review in November. I am acutely aware that the focus of this debate also extends to the situation of EU dual nationals imprisoned in Iran. There again I would like to be clear: the practice of detaining and imprisoning individuals, such as the UK Iranian citizen Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, solely on account of their nationality is contrary to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Iran has ratified and is bound to uphold. Iran’s continued practice of detaining dual nationals clearly breaches the commitment that no one shall be subject to arbitrary arrest or detention. As the European Union, we will continue to call for the release of all EU-Iranian dual nationals and all Iranian human rights defenders. We also call on Iran to ensure that no individual is detained arbitrarily, and that detainees are not subject to any form of mistreatment. Detainees should also have timely access to a lawyer of their own choosing, and to adequate medical care. Honourable Members, thank you for this debate. I can tell you that we are encouraged by the attention paid to these issues by the Members of the European Parliament and we will continue our efforts to work together with you to support human rights defenders across the world.

I understand those worries and I hope I can assuage them at least to some extent. Of course, the Commission cannot speak for, or bind, the Court, but I can reassure you that we are following the situation of emergency services, including volunteer firefighters, very closely. Firefighters are a key element of emergency and civil protection services everywhere in Europe. Across the European Union, firefighting services are made up of a mixture of professional or career firefighters and volunteers. The composition of firefighting services varies greatly among different Member States. For instance, 80% of French firefighters are volunteers. The numbers are even higher in countries such as Germany or Austria, but in other countries, like Greece or Bulgaria, the firefighting workforce is almost entirely professionalised. To be clear, the Matzak judgment does not oblige Member States to have a particular mix of career firefighters and volunteer firefighters. It certainly does not oblige Member States to get rid of volunteer firefighters altogether or always to treat volunteers in exactly the same way as career professionals. The central issue of the Matzak judgment was about resting time and, more specifically, the entitlement to resting time for firefighters who, while on standby, are obliged, first, to live and stay permanently near to the fire station and, second, to respond to a call and reach the fire station within eight minutes. The Court concluded that, given these specific constraints, Mr Matzak’s standby time should be counted as working time for the purpose of the Working Time Directive and should not be seen as free time. Most of the ensuing debate about the Matzak case has been centered on the notion of ‘worker’. However, on that point the judgment said nothing new. A long line of case law makes clear that, under EU law, whether someone is considered a worker depends on the circumstances. Somebody who pursues real and genuine activities, who is subordinated to another person and who is remunerated in return, is a worker for the purposes of this piece of law. In the case of Mr Matzak, the Court concluded that, in his particular circumstances, these conditions were met. Following the judgment, various stakeholders jumped to the conclusion that EU law had made it impossible to have volunteer firefighters, but I believe this conclusion is incorrect. Let me be clear: there is no one—size—fits—all reply to the question of the status of volunteer firefighters under the Working Time Directive. Each specific case needs to be assessed against the criteria for qualification as a worker established by the Court, and, if the Working Time Directive does apply, its provisions on resting time should be respected. But the Working Time Directive offers a lot of flexibility for sectors such as firefighting and emergency services. For instance, derogations from daily and weekly rests are possible, of course, if compensatory rest is provided. Member States may also allow workers to opt out of the 48 hour average maximum working time under certain conditions, and in exceptional circumstances, such as natural or technological disasters, attacks or major incidents, the directive can be disapplied altogether. In summary, each case must be examined on its own merits to ensure that the status of volunteer is not used to circumvent European labour law. The Matzak judgment does not mean that every volunteer firefighter in the European Union automatically qualifies as a worker and, in any event, the Working Time Directive provides for flexibility to accommodate the needs of emergency services, such as fire services, without denying the firefighters protection of their health and safety.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 132, "date": "2019-09-19.json", "name": "Anne SANDER", "mepid": "24594", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, forest fires, floods, accidents, rescue, personal assistance... the list of services provided by volunteer firefighters is long and is growing year after year. The events of this summer have reminded us that their intervention is essential in our daily lives, to ensure the protection of citizens, businesses and rural areas. Volunteer firefighters are also helping to create social bonds, especially in rural areas. Their selfless civic commitment is essential for a more united Europe. In the European Union, among the 3 and a half million firefighters, there are many volunteers. In France, these volunteers make up 80% of the workforce. They alone account for two-thirds of the response time of protection services. Colleagues, I would like to sound the alarm here, because this model seems to us to be in danger. A ruling by the European Court of Justice in February 2018 described the situation of a Belgian volunteer firefighter in home care as working time. This volunteer firefighter's periods of duty were recognized as working time and were compensated. If this case is a case law, it will have to be clarified, but we are concerned that this breach will lead to the possible integration of volunteer firefighters into the scope of the Working Time Directive. The obligations set out in this directive in terms of rest time, work time, but also leave would therefore make the activity of volunteer firefighters incompatible with paid employment. There is therefore a real risk that volunteering will be confused with a workload. If that were the case, it would spell the end of our backup model. It would also undermine the free civic commitment of volunteerism. The consequences of this situation would be dramatic because of the legal uncertainty. Europe, of course, is supposed to promote forms of volunteerism and ensure the safety of its citizens. We end up with a situation where it would be quite the opposite. That is why we are mobilising, I am mobilising, with my colleagues here today, but also with all my colleagues in the EPP Group, and we are asking that the scope of this directive be clarified. We call on the European Commission to implement concrete actions, a framework to restore the legal security of the voluntary firefighter system.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 133, "date": "2019-09-19.json", "name": "Milan BRGLEZ", "mepid": "197446", "text": "  On behalf of the S&amp;D Group. Although this is the last debate in this plenary, it is one of the key. Especially for socialists and socialists and social democrats and social democrats. It concerns solidarity as our fundamental value and also the fundamental value of the European Union, as set out in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union, and, of course, the mission of voluntary assistance to others. Together, these two can really form a European way of life. In many countries of the European Union, voluntary firefighters are a pillar of protection against natural and other disasters. Volunteering in this area has a long tradition. In Slovenia we have been celebrating 150 years of volunteer firefighters this year and we are also the country within the European Union, which has the most voluntary firefighters in terms of population, 150 000 of all, 50 000 operational. In fact, voluntary firefighters in some Member States account for as much as 90% or even more of all firefighters.  And it is only the combination of voluntary and professional units that enables response and assistance in the event of fires, natural disasters, floods, cases of serious traffic accidents and other human distress. And in urban centers and in the countryside. At the same time, firefighters in Europe and beyond are ranked as the professional group of people most trusted by people. They are therefore a key part of civil protection because they ensure the personal safety of the population and contribute to public safety.  Of course, there are differences between national systems and ways of organising voluntary firefighting, and everywhere this is a noble mission. Individuals and individuals perform it in their spare time and without pay or compensation as an essential element of the employment relationship. Because they are not paid for their noble work or mission, they especially deserve our recognition, praise and thanks. Protection and protection against fires and other accidents is essentially the responsibility of the Member States. Through our decisions and legislative acts, meps of the European Parliament have an indirect or unintended influence on the status of volunteer firefighters in Europe. Not just positive. The 2003 Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on certain aspects of the organisation of working time was adopted with a view to protecting workers in the European Union. It sets minimum safety and health standards for the organisation of working time in all Member States, which is a major step forward in protecting workers' rights in the European Union.  The implementation of the Directive, especially following the Court's decision in the Matzak case of May 2018, according to which on-call time at home also for voluntary firefighters employed by private individuals is considered to be working time, means that female volunteers and volunteers could easily exceed the 48-hour working time, i.e. the maximum 48-hour working time per week, and the required 11 hours of daily rest. This is a high risk to the protection systems against natural and other disasters in the Member States, as volunteering could be prevented.  However, as a social democrat, I believe that the existing protection and definition of workers and the future protection and promotion of volunteering are equally important and are not mutually exclusive. We can't sacrifice one in the name of another. We need to improve the legal rules at most so that both are strengthened.  Namely, natural and other accidents do not know the working hours. They're unpredictable in scope and time. There will never be enough professional units, especially outside urban centres. That's why we have to do everything we can to keep volunteering.  It should be possible to coordinate the professional obligations and mission of a volunteer firefighter or fireman, to promote their recruitment and to ensure their equipment. The European Union Civil Protection Mechanism, the RescEU project, and in particular the Crisis Management Coordination Centre, are welcome to respond to major disasters, ensure effective solidarity between Member States and exchange good practices. With them we have obtained a reserve at European Union level that complements national systems and allows coordination or coordination and sharing of resources. However, it is essential to respect the principle of subsidiarity and to prevent centralisation. Over-regulation must be avoided, national traditions taken into account and without interfering with systems that work well and are trusted by people.  With optimism, I am thread that Commissioner-designate Janez Lenarčič knows very well the importance and role of voluntary firefighters. I believe that voluntary firefighters and firefighters under the direction of the department will be properly placed within the framework of EU mechanisms and that, in cooperation with the Member States and other Members of the Commission, there will be an improvement in their status.  However, I must point out that volunteering is not a form of work. Because of the dilemmas created by the 2003 Directive and the decision of the Court of Justice of the EU, we must not change the directive and the definition of worker or accept exceptions for individual countries or groups of countries. In particular, we must not at most to promote its reduction to a 35-hour weekly working day.  I therefore propose that we discuss a specific directive covering civil engagement for public security services. Within it, however, we make sure that status, safety and health standards are properly defined and the possibility of incentives or rewards for voluntary firefighters and firefighters are also given.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Basically, I can agree with the previous speakers: we really need to examine such a new, separate directive, and I would be glad if we could find planning certainty for our fire brigades here. In my Member State, Germany, there are currently 1.1 million active firefighters; 95% of these are members of the volunteer fire brigade. There are only about 100 professional fire brigades, but 24,000 volunteer fire brigades. I myself come from a very rural region in the Oberallgäu; the nearest professional fire brigade is located 150 kilometres away in Augsburg. Volunteering is not limited to the fire brigades. Across Germany, there are 1.8 million volunteers in civil protection, fire brigades and emergency services. In my state, Bavaria, there are 470 000 rescue workers; of these, 450 000 are voluntary and voluntary. These figures clearly show that volunteering is the backbone of our fire and rescue system. But not only that. Especially in rural areas, the volunteer fire brigade plays a central role in social life. The exchange of all age groups among themselves in all social classes is specifically maintained here. We must therefore promote and protect this commitment. Volunteering should be fulfilled and must not frustrate. Now we have this European Working Time Directive – my predecessors referred to this – and we must, of course, state that voluntary working time cannot be offset against working time from the working occupations. That would be a threat to our entire rescue system. In Germany, we have assumed for many years that voluntary services do not fall within this scope. And now we have this court ruling, which again worries us, because we must not define the volunteer fire brigade as workers in the sense of a normal professional life. We need legal certainty and we need clarity for our volunteer fire brigade. Unfortunately, we are not making any progress at all here at the moment, and all the only thing that remains for us and all the volunteers is that we will actually find solutions here at European level. Our voluntary service system has proved its worth and plays an important role in the growing social fabric.

There are more than 16,000 Volunteer Fire Brigades in Poland, of which more than 4,300 units today operate under the National Fire and Rescue System, i.e. they support this professional, state guard. That's more than 225,000 firefighters who can take part in direct rescue efforts. In total, the Volunteer Fire Brigades bring together almost 700 000 people in Poland, including – worth highlighting – 82 000 are children and young people, because, as has been mentioned here, also on the example of other countries, these voluntary fire brigades are often in their small homelands, in their municipalities, in the villages where they operate, especially in rural areas, are such a cultural centre and forming social ties.  The government, which I had the privilege of representing as minister of the interior, also responsible for the fire brigade, the Government of Law and Justice in Poland for the first time took over the Volunteer Fire Brigades program of modernization of uniformed services. For the first time, we have harmonised the legislation in such a way that the Volunteer Fire Brigades can be supported. In conclusion, I would like to say to the Old Polish custom of the bridesmaids and bridesmaids of the Volunteer Fire Brigades: God's happiness!

Madam President, today in this Chamber, I am delighted because we are trying to make invisibles visible. Our eyes are used to firefighters, we don't see them anymore! I am talking about men and women whom each of us have probably already crossed in each of our Member States, stopped at the side of the road or blackened by fire fumes. It is thanks to their strength of vocation and dedication that all this is possible. Who are we talking about, then? As I said, men and women everywhere respond to distress calls, in big cities, small villages, in all weathers, rain, snow, wind. At every moment, when you, your loved ones or your friends, all citizens, need help, they will be there, benevolent; they'll be there, perhaps, to save your life. So these men and women are the firefighters. Just yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, if you took public transport like me to come to Parliament, you could not escape this one that cries out for their distress. Colleagues, today, these firefighters, our firefighters see red and this is, I think, the time to thank them in this Chamber and to pay tribute to them. I would add that in France there is a strike by firefighters, and I give them my unwavering support. In France, as in most of our Member States, the vast majority (80%) interventions are carried out by voluntary teams. Of course, volunteers receive compensation, that's the least we can do! But when are we going to really give them the recognition they deserve? During their service, they do not benefit from any pension contributions, any contributions for the risks they incur, or any protective status. We cannot accept that these men and women are cut and hard at will, and I assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that their safety is our responsibility. The day before yesterday, I was talking to a firefighter from the Pyrenees-Atlantic. He told me the story of a 21-year-old volunteer firefighter who was burned in the hands, arms and thighs while trying to save his colleagues from a deadly fire. Today, this young volunteer firefighter has to pay back 9,000 euros. What for? Because the medical expert considered that it was not in the context of his work! I ask you the question: if it was you he saved, you who, today, are sitting comfortably in your chair... put yourself in his place! Double punishment assured, you would be touched both in your flesh and in your wallet, simply for doing your duty.  So let's go back to volunteer status. Indeed, this status has just been challenged by a judgment of the European Court of Justice, which recognises the qualification of workers, in accordance with the directive on the limitation of working time. We can only appreciate the trajectory it indicates. However, this change in status implies a profound change in the organization of firefighters. And many, I see them, are already calling for an exception to the directive. So, to these, to these great profit-head explorers, I say that they are very wrong. Volunteer status is not the answer. We have to go back to service and the common good. Finally, I will say that those who protect us today need us to protect them, so that their motto, which is 'save or perish', never becomes 'save and perish'.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 138, "date": "2019-09-19.json", "name": "Sylvie BRUNET", "mepid": "197576", "text": "   Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the Commission for this communication, which was highly anticipated, as far as I am concerned, on this sensitive subject, in view of the issues that are currently the case for those involved in the emergency model. In this speech today, which is my first speech , since I am a brand new Member of Parliament - in plenary session, as an MEP, let me stress three points. My first point reminds me that there are about 3.5 million volunteer firefighters in the European Union and I would like to acknowledge their commitment to the service of all, as my colleagues have done, at a time when climate change is, alas, leading to more and more natural disasters. This is how the excitement caused by the Matzac decision must be properly measured. This court ruling, considering the volunteer time of certain categories of firefighters carrying out home guarding as working time, may have surprised while concerning a very specific situation, which is not that of all volunteer firefighters. In this context, it is clear that this first clarification is more than welcome - thank you for that, Commissioner. I'm coming to my second point. I have listened carefully, Commissioner. I have noted that, in the Commission's view, the specificities of national models must be taken into account. I have also heard that you have rightly pointed out the importance of the principle of subsidiarity in this area. I am very happy about that. This approach should preserve the material organisation of our emergency services and keep intact the possibility of mobilising men and women in emergency situations throughout the European Union. It is, of course, this preservation that I call for. Finally, my third point is more general. Today's debate is an opportunity to recall the urgent need to support civil protection mechanisms through the appropriate European instruments. We need to encourage more coordination of our relief systems. We need to consolidate the European Civil Security Mechanism, pool our resources and disaster scenarios, and share our expertise. In conclusion, I would like to express my relief at this plenary meeting today. Let us preserve these national models of civil security, some of which are based in particular on altruism and volunteerism, which work well and ensure the territorial proximity of relief efforts. At the same time, let us boost the European Union's action by leveraging and at the level where it is effective.

Every day, French people, farmers, craftsmen, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and SMEs, take the uniform to help us.  However, the courage and dedication of this generous commitment to the community is poorly rewarded. Every day our firefighters are assaulted in response. Our volunteer firefighters feel very alone and poorly regarded. Their situation does not seem to have improved since Marine Le Pen's last intervention on the subject last year.  The jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice will make it impossible to reconcile their services and professional activity. For accounting, budgetary and above all civic reasons, full professionalization should not be conceivable. Daily and crisis relief will no longer be assured as it is today, to the detriment of the French and the resilience of our society.  The French model of civil security is based on volunteerism, which accounts for 80 per cent of the fire brigade workforce in France. Since professionalisation is neither desirable nor possible, it is therefore essential to adopt a specific directive during this new European mandate. Beyond the legal debate, the issue is political and civic, it concerns other European countries. This is a choice of values and society. A volunteer firefighter is now committed to protecting his fellow citizens and his territory.  In the context of the acceleration and increasing of civil security crises, it is more necessary than ever to be able to count on the civic commitment of volunteer firefighters throughout Europe.

Volunteers are often joined to help regular firefighters. I am a volunteer myself and have been involved in the extinguishing of forest fires and know first-person how difficult this task is and how difficult this job is. We must not allow regulation in legislation at European level to jeopardise the status, life and health of volunteer firefighters in the Member States. In 2018, the Court of Justice of the European Union in its case determined that the time a Belgian citizen spends as a volunteer firefighter should be counted as working time. This sets a precedent in some member states where volunteering is regulated at national level and would in practice mean that volunteer firefighters would have two jobs each. I think it's clear to everyone what problems all this can lead to.  Directive 2003/88 on aspects of the organisation of working time is negotiated and drawn up in a different context from today, and its aim should in no case be to intimidate or discourage volunteers, but to protect the rights of vulnerable employees. With all due respect to the work of the European Court of Justice, I believe that we should not be left to be guided by interpretations of the Court of Justice, especially in this case, which, instead of bringing legal clarity, creates legal chaos in many Member States, in areas related to the protection of citizens' health and life and the environment.

The organisation and the functioning of firefighting services is and remains a competence of individual Member States and each Member State has its own specificities and needs.

I take this opportunity to point out here that users of the Nationally and Free Emergency Information System (EMERGENCY) for smartphones and tablets in Hungary can obtain fresh knowledge about the current situation, fires, accidents, power outages or alerts issued by meteorology about the current situation in their place of residence, the areas affected by their destination, monitored routes, counties or even the whole country. The app can be used to prevent accidents and improve user safety.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 148, "date": "2019-09-19.json", "name": "Leszek MILLER", "mepid": "197540", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. – Voluntary fire brigades are undoubtedly a very important element in the rescue system of most EU Member States. Their members are well-trained women and men, who are usually the first to provide sacrificial assistance to victims at the scene. They also work closely with other services to ensure the safety of citizens in the area of their activities (cities, municipalities) or neighbouring areas.  There are more than 1,800 TSOs with nearly 96,000 volunteers in the Wielkopolska region of Poland, whose inhabitants have entrusted me with the mandate of an MEP. Most of them are men, but women's teams are also very numerous, as they have more than 2.5 thousand members. It is worth noting that in Wielkopolska there are also more than 1,000 youth fire teams with 13,4 000 members, including nearly 5,000 girls.  I believe that the hard work of the volunteer fire brigades deserves the highest recognition. I am all the more concerned about the risks that may arise to the status of voluntary fire services in the European Union. I firmly believe that we should take every action to ensure that the status of volunteer firefighter in the EU remains intact. Moreover, the European Commission and Parliament should bear in mind that the effectiveness of voluntary guards depends to a large extent on whether they have specialised fire-fighting equipment and whether they are properly funded.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 149, "date": "2019-09-19.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}]
