We would not be able to present quality work and good results without good cooperation with Commissioner Cretu, who is constantly trying to improve the results of cohesion policy. Speaking of cohesion policy, we must say that this has long been more than just one of the European Union's policies. These have long been more than just funds or just projects. Cohesion policy and the projects we fund through the European Structural Investment Funds have become part of the beliefs and values ​​we share - an example of how we can express our European solidarity. We have turned from an institution into a reflection of people's opinions and interests. That is why it is extremely important after 2020 to continue to maintain this delicate balance between the portfolio of financial instruments and the grants we provide for our regions and municipalities. Our central task must be to meet their wishes and needs, and at the same time, none of the crises facing the European Union or the challenges we face must prevent us from fulfilling these commitments. That is why it is not right to start talking from now on about the percentage of financial instruments, the percentage of grants, since it must be subordinated solely to the interests of our municipalities and regions. However, it is important to anticipate what will follow our intervention and what would be most important for the beneficiaries. Let's set priorities! My suggestion is that they be small in number, but provided with resources so that we can easily see the results. Long ago, what it counts from our work, it is not the reports, it is not the reports, it is not the accounting. These are the visible results that our citizens see. The reason they send us here, especially the people who work in the Committee on Regional Development, is to make their lives easier and the countries of the European Union richer. I believe that this is at least the role of our work in this committee. The new initiatives we are launching in the European Union are commendable. Many of them are successful and meet people's expectations, meet the challenges that lie ahead. However, we must not forget that cohesion policy and grants for developing regions are not handouts. They are part of the whole that the European Union represents, part of the effort to present the same quality of life in every part of the European Union. Otherwise, fencing with fences will not only be physical, but even more scary. It will be in our understanding, where instead of building bridges, we will build barriers. That is why I believe that it is extremely important with this report to launch a meaningful debate on how to maintain grant funding for developing regions and to present financial instruments for faster developing countries, while also being able to make sure that everything new, which we are presenting - both financial instruments and grants, to be equally accessible everywhere in the European Union, and I am sure - people will appreciate that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-05-18.json", "name": "Ruža TOMAŠIĆ", "mepid": "119431", "text": "reporter. - Mr President, Honorable Envoy Crețu, cohesion policy is perhaps one of the best examples of how membership of the European Union can be positive for less developed Member States. The single market and the four fundamental freedoms sound great in theory, but if the Member States are too different in their level of economic development, one always gets the impression that someone is taking advantage of someone. From less developed members, workers go to more developed ones willing to work for less money than the domicile labor force, which lowers the price of labor and creates dissatisfaction among local people. On the other hand, less developed members are losing their working age population and thus entering even deeper into the long-term economic and demographic crisis. Reducing these disparities so that they do not encourage excessive waves of migration from poorer to richer members of the Union and create citizen dissatisfaction is very important for the future of the European Union. Cohesion policy has an important place in this process, and technical support, which we are talking about today, is a quality mechanism for creating preconditions for good use of funds and financing of quality projects in less developed members. Lack of administrative capacity in less developed member states is a major obstacle to better use of European money. As a rule, post-communist countries have a large administration in relation to the number of inhabitants, but it is insufficiently trained to quickly, efficiently and transparently withdraw funds from European funds. of which they would be permanently disabled in catching the connection with the more developed ones. That is why the correct, efficient and transparent use of technical support in the next financial period is so important! A new approach based on real decentralization, good education and, most importantly, evaluation of implemented projects will create the preconditions for the administration manages better and ensures greater absorption of money from the European level. At the time of writing, I have spoken to a number of stakeholders from different Member States, and I have noticed the same problem with a few - the use of technical support is merely satisfying the form that usually takes place at national level. We need to change that. This money should be used at lower levels and involve local and regional actors, anticipate and meet their needs, and training must be tailored to the target group of participants. Therefore, with this report, I call on the Member States to better report on the types of activities funded by technical assistance, but also on the results achieved. Time goes by, money is spent and results are lacking and this is very likely because there was no real evaluation system. That is why I think that the regular updating and public availability of the database on activities that Member States intend to take or have already taken should be considered. I hope that we will learn from the mistakes made so far and really dedicate ourselves to improving the future use of technical assistance. The purpose is not just to spend money but primarily to use it for those for whom it is intended, and we can only do so if we inform them in a timely manner about the training opportunities offered and create awareness that technical support can help greatly in the economic uplift of more passive areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-05-18.json", "name": "Daniele VIOTTI", "mepid": "124791", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, cohesion policy is one of the European Union's greatest successes, thanks to it many regions have emerged from poverty and it has guaranteed the development of even the most peripheral regions.

Too long bureaucratic procedures, difficulties in combining different tools and funds and various delays are limiting the potential of this extraordinary policy.

I would like to begin my speech today by thanking, first of all, the REGI Committee, the Committee on Regional Development of the European Parliament, and the two rapporteurs, Mr Novakov and Mrs Tomašić, for these reports. First of all, I will talk about the report on the right balance between financial instruments and grants under European Union cohesion policy. The Commission of course welcomes this report, which is a key topic for the ongoing discussions on Omnibus, the changes proposed for your adoption in the revision of the multiannual financial framework, but also for the development of the post-2020 policy. In our view, the European Commission, an appropriate combination of grants and financial instruments is essential to make a difference on the ground, at local and regional level. I think we can all agree on some common principles that are needed to achieve this successfully. First of all, the financing mix must be made according to the type of investment, but also according to the characteristics of each sector and each region. We believe that a significant part of cohesion policy must be delivered through grants, and it could not be delivered otherwise when it comes to essential infrastructure, such as schools, hospitals, the care of children who do not have a direct profit. The financial instruments are the ones that complement this support for income-generating investments. At the same time, financial instruments should not be reserved only for rich instruments, and you know very well that we encourage all Member States and provide technical assistance for all regions, including the poorest, to adopt and duplicate their financial instruments. The Commission supports all regions in strengthening the capacity to use, as I was saying, financial instruments. The second principle is that of responsibility, of empowering stakeholders. I believe that this is essential to enable cohesion policy to have results on the ground. The managing authorities within our programs are our best and closest partners without whom we would not be able to implement our programs. They are strategically placed to identify those combinations of grants and financial instruments that are appropriate for each region. Instead, national and regional promotion banks benefit from fundamental expertise, which we must use to strengthen our ability to attract and make the best investments. Therefore, through Omnibus we propose to award contracts directly for the implementation of financial instruments and of course we in the Commission would assess whether these regulations proposed by Omnibus will be adopted by you and then by the Council as soon as possible. The third principle: we need a well-defined framework that allows for the development of secure, long-term projects, and so it is important that the changes we are discussing now are balanced and calibrated. With regard to Ms Tomašić's own-initiative report on the future perspective of technical assistance in cohesion policy, the Commission of course welcomes this report. Several Commission initiatives are recognized, such as TAIEX REGIO PEER 2 PEER. Unfortunately, in my weekly visits to many Member States, I often feel that not even the ministers are aware of all these tools that the Commission makes available, and this saddens me because, in fact, I have invented all these tools precisely to support the Member States. We have 250,000 field workers in the field of European funds. They have accumulated a experience, greater or lesser; some have been working in this field for forty-two years, since the Regional Development Fund was invented, others have been working for ten years, as in Romania or Bulgaria, others for four years. I strongly believe in this exchange of good practice which supports the exchange between fund managers and experts in order to increase administrative capacity between Member States, regions and municipalities. We offer these services at the request of the Member States and I can assure you that we have very few requests in this regard; so if a Member State tells us tomorrow that it needs technical assistance with public procurement, within five days the Commission will mobilize and send the best experts from the regions performing in this field. So, from this point of view, I encourage you all to make known all the tools that the Commission makes available to the Member States, free of charge. That is why I congratulate you on this report for providing valuable suggestions on the more efficient use of technical assistance, a very useful tool, especially in the context of post-2020 discussions. Therefore, I would like to emphasize once again that we in the European Commission encourage Member States to take an approach to the use of targeted financial instruments in the light of the difficulties and experiences they have faced in the past. For example, we suggested that Member States use technical assistance to complete the fulfillment of preconditions - what we call ex-ante conditionalities for investment, but also for the implementation of anti-fraud and anti-corruption actions. Unfortunately, Member States generally want to use this technical assistance in general to cover staff costs and wages. I appreciate your speech and that of Mr Novakov, who highlighted very well the challenges of labor migration, brain drain, brain drain, demographic challenges in less developed regions. We are here to help. You are right: training and preparation are sometimes more important than money, and I am glad that both rapporteurs, including the representative of the Committee on Budgets, have emphasized the responsibility of the Member States, because when it comes to implementation, one hundred percent is the responsibility of those states. We called on the Member States to ensure that all funds can support staff and authorities performing the most important tasks, including intermediate bodies, but also regional and local authorities. I believe, just like you, that we can improve the way we use technical assistance, I believe that evolution must be supported, we are at the beginning of the debate for the future of cohesion policy. We are thinking, for example, of advancing technical assistance at the beginning of the funding period, not every year, so that the implementation system can be prepared before the start of programs and the selection of projects - is one of the ideas. We could also use technical assistance to support national and regional administrations to strengthen their project pool. This will help us to ensure that the implementation of projects can start as soon as funding is available because it is very important for us to learn from the lessons of the past and not start the financial cycle with all these delays that we are now experiencing. I also registered 7 years ago. In any case, we also consider ideas such as better targeting of technical assistance to beneficiaries or exchanges of experience between regions. Thank you very much. Also from the budget, Mr Viotti emphasized the key role of strategic funds and structural investment funds, how they can be combined to maximize impact on the ground. I look forward to your comments and your suggestions.Thank you very much!", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-05-18.json", "name": "Miguel VIEGAS", "mepid": "125100", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. - Mr President, in this period of convergence, from the year 2000 onwards, the European Union began to diverge with the less developed regions and with those less developed regions moving away from the European average and the wealthier regions. In fact, the Multiannual Financial Framework reflects this reality with a significant decrease in funds directed towards cohesion, compared to previous tables. And the question of financial instruments represents, in fact, another side of this deliberate option to subordinate redistributive and agricultural policies. I must say that, according to the hearings we held in the framework of the AGRI Committee, it has been widely proven that financial instruments cannot under any circumstances replace existing support, namely at the level of the second pillar of the CAP and, therefore, cohesion it cannot be a watchword.

In the new reality it is necessary for the technical assistance to be accessible and to be able to offer special services, at project level, or even beneficiary. In every region, in every municipality, in every university, in every ministry there are separate needs. There are separate people, separate resources and technical assistance can help make projects of particular importance to local communities a reality. It is therefore necessary, first of all, to increase the transparency of the expenditure of resources on technical assistance and to immediately proceed with a study on the contribution of technical assistance to the implementation of cohesion policy in order to arrive at targeted indicators and methods. evaluation for the next programming period. Besides, we have a writing sample for specialized technical assistance and this is what happened in Greece with the task force. According to the Court of Auditors' report, we have positive results in the absorption of resources, but mixed results in the implementation of sustainable structural reforms.

For us socialists, it is clear that we will focus on the projects that matter most to the citizens of the European Union. Investments should focus on areas likely to have multiplier effects on jobs and growth, such as investments in innovation, education and sustainable energy. People are the real driving force behind innovation and the establishment of just and progressive societies. For this reason, financial instruments should also contribute to strengthening the social pillar of cohesion policy. It is also important to improve the performance of financial instruments in less developed regions, that is, in regions with higher unemployment rates, trying to find measures, through positive discrimination, which help to reduce asymmetries. Finally, we want a cohesion policy that continues to distribute public funds in the European Union but, at the same time, advocates demanding accountability and accountability. It is crucial that clear rules are established and technical assistance guidelines are provided to the administrations involved to overcome the problems, something that the Commissioner has always advocated alongside the European Parliament from the outset.

Cohesion policy and the EU budget in general should have a financing system that makes it possible to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the budget, but which also attracts private investors so that the financing gap is filled as a result. I would like to emphasize that lending should not be a complete substitute for grants, but should aim for the right mix that makes the best use of businesses, regions and local government. When we look at both more developed and less developed Member States in the EU and their investment needs, we find that the funding gap varies across sectors and priorities. However, one thing is clear: in addition to the grant, other funding channels are needed. The solution can be found in the loan. The European Investment Bank must play a more central role in this. The European Investment Bank was set up in the context of the Treaty of Rome, but now is the time for it to play a more central role in cohesion policy as well. It already provides loans, loan guarantees and capital, which, together with grants and subsidies, form a functioning system of private and public funding. Problems with funding are also the lack of adequate information about the company. Training and guidance are needed at all levels of government so that a suitable range of funding can be found for each situation.

There is at least one scenario in the White Paper on the Future of the EU in which EU cohesion policy would go overboard. It is about nothing less than solidarity, social equilibrium and - if you will - the freedom to invest sensibly in the regions. Who seriously wants to dispose of all these core values ​​that have practically been abolished in cohesion policy? After all, the new reflection paper “Shaping globalization” does not want this. I can only support you, Commissioner, if you keep saying aloud: Cohesion policy is not a financial instrument, but a policy with a long-term objective, namely the creation of equal living conditions in the Union. And that is why, in my opinion, it makes no sense for us to reduce the mix of instruments in cohesion policy to credit instruments.

Cohesion policy is designed to help lagging regions. It is clear that in market conditions, more competitive players raise a larger share of funds. In the case of regional policy, these are the richer regions. Therefore, by allowing the widespread use of financial instruments, it is clear that we will not only do this for the poor, but also for the richer. Personally, I really don’t want that. Therefore, as the shadow rapporteur for the Greens, I call for a vote in favor of this report. In it, I would like to thank the rapporteur, he was able to properly assess the threats posed by the use of financial instruments. And it is not just about increasing regional disparities. This includes opacity, strengthening the partnership principle and much more. Also, the report has managed to strike the right balance between cohesion policy and the philosophy of cohesion, while not ruling out the possibility of exploiting the potential of financial instruments where appropriate. Colleagues, Ruža Tomašić's report is devoted to an important and sometimes ignored topic. The European Union spends tens of billions of taxpayers on cohesion policy. The European Union has developed rules for the use of this aid. Accordingly, the European Union must ensure that the Member States have sufficient capacity to use this aid properly. Until now, technical assistance has been funded from the cohesion budget. Unfortunately, in more cases, this support remained at the national level and rarely reached the regions, let alone the municipal level. And where else, below the municipal level, are the communities. Let us not forget that community-led local development is becoming an increasingly important instrument of Cohesion Policy.

However, it is necessary to avoid reproducing the errors and waste that have characterized it in various Member States and therefore, if on the one hand it is necessary to insist above all on the involvement of regional and local authorities, both in the design and in the implementation of technical assistance measures, on the other hand, it is necessary to make the related expenditure more transparent, which amounts to 13.4 billion.

The aim of cohesion policy is to strengthen the economic and social cohesion of the community and to catch up with the less developed regions. In 2004, ten countries, mainly Central and Eastern European countries, joined the European Union. If we were to ask their population now how they feel whether this catching-up has taken place to the extent expected, their answer is no. Of course, it is possible to measure regional catching-up in terms of GDP, competitiveness, infrastructure, where there has been development. But for them, the fundamental question is how their quality of life has changed in 13 years. Prices have approached Western Europeans, and the wage gap has widened. This needs to be addressed at EU level, at decision-making level. If the governments of the regions do not do this, the population will have an opportunity, the European Citizens' Initiative. Thus, the Jobbik for Hungary Movement took the lead in such an initiative, found partners in six other EU countries, and launched a wage catch-up initiative, which should be said to be a goal for developed countries as well. the consequence is that people are migrating from these countries and causing tension there.

And then it cannot be the case that you only work with loans, things that you have to pay back. Throughout the social domain there are countless projects that you simply have to get off the ground. There is no market mechanism behind that that will pull that for a while. We get that clarity today, because now and then I read in the communication from the Commission or the EIB: \"banking business solves everything\". No, it really won't. So, this is a good balance here. Second remark: it is extremely difficult to work with all kinds of Revolving Funds instead of with subsidy instruments with Public Private, and we need that technical assistance for that. I also think that the Commission should also set those quality requirements with Member States that want to use new instruments and make much tighter agreements for seven years. That is a nice stepping stone to the new period. Finally, a number of things are going well. Let the stars shine. Let's see where it can be done.

On the report on grants, I would like to say that we point out the risks of overuse of financial instruments, but we also make a choice and give a direction as Parliament, that is to continue to keep the topic of grants, the instrument of grants as an instrument strategy of cohesion policy. It is therefore on this choice that we must focus attention, effort and dialogue with the Commission and the Council. The second report on technical assistance seems to me to be even more important. Here I point out three issues: we have made a choice of merit, not only in the sense that the instrument is important in helping States, regions and local autonomies to do more and better in programming EU funds, and the Commissioner does well to raise the issue of more information, but we have made a choice, I believe, that goes in the right direction. We have said that assistance is technical not only in terms of resource absorption but it means more quality, to understand exactly how community resources modify the fundamental characteristics of the economy and society where they intervene. More cooperation, inspired by the cohesion policy, between the structural reforms we introduce in individual countries to make them more competitive and the relaunch of a public investment policy and, therefore, an important heart of the technical assistance policy. Finally, a point on which I believe we must work more and ask the Commission for a contribution on this: not to make technical assistance an instrument outside the reform of the state and public institutions. Building a modern European ruling class that knows how to use Community resources better and able to offer new innovation and development policies.This is the challenge of the new technical assistance, not a market tool, but an ability to build a new statehood especially in many regions where we need the contribution of a new ruling class, able to make better use of these tools.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2017-05-18.json", "name": "Mirosław PIOTROWSKI", "mepid": "28341", "text": "- Mr Chairman!

In general, I think this is the right approach, as it is in harmony with the declared European solidarity. However, as we also note in the report, there are some drawbacks to financial instruments (point 11.). We note already in point 1 of the report that they were designed before the financial and economic crisis and were not the most appropriate. There are examples of misuse of these funds, but it should be noted that they go to the Member States that joined the Community later, and - despite the sometimes problematic use of them - are often the only reason for support for the European Union.

Both reports address key issues such as flexibility, complementarity, the combination of the European Structural and Investment Funds with other European Union financial instruments, and also address one key issue that has already been mentioned - the good balance: the balance between the experience we already have so far in the implementation of cohesion policy and balance for future implementation.

Thank you for your contributions. I really share your views that this policy is more important than ever, in times where we have so many divisions. I think it is very important to show solidarity between Member States, and this debate shows that together we can make this policy stronger. I would like to make some clarifications because I think there were some misunderstandings. I would like to underline that financial instruments do not lead to reallocation of funds between Member States or regions. When financial instruments are used, we do not support banks, we use them to transfer EU resources, with strict rules. Synergies are, of course, very important. I would like to thank Mr Lambert van Nistelrooij for [mentioning] this communications idea, a very elaborate document. I am very grateful to the Maltese Presidency that they also included in the Luxembourg meeting the Commission’s communications issue, on our debates between ministries for cohesion policy, because it is very important. I am very sorry that Mr Finch is not here any more because the irony of our policy is that this policy was created because of pressure by the UK, in 1975, when the United Kingdom said it would not go to the Council in Paris if this ERDF solidarity fund were not created, because there was the situation with the closure of mines, and it was the European funds, the ERDF solidarity fund, which retrained people in new activities. I am very sorry, but I don’t know if the people when voting for Brexit knew that they had jobs because of the European Union. Mr Finch is right. It is not European money, it is taxpayers' money, but this money is also going to the UK: in Liverpool, as you said, we now have the Metro in Cardiff ongoing and a lot of big projects, such as the university in Manchester . You mentioned the Peace program, which is very important. I am very worried, like you, about this because it was not London, it was not Belfast, it was not Dublin, but Brussels who put the money together for the reconciliation policy. I fully trust that Mr Barnier, our Chief Negotiator, will deal with that because this is a very important program and shows that this policy also has a role in healing the wounds that we have on the map of Europe. Thank you very much and I will now say a few words in my mother tongue. I believe that the two rapporteurs have played an important role in emphasizing the need to use both grants and financial instruments. Grants are practically very necessary when it comes to infrastructure, things, hospitals, schools, roads, which do not necessarily produce immediate profit, and financial instruments, Mr. Novakov, indeed, share your position, are just as indispensable, but we must to make sure that this combination is done in a suitable, calibrated, efficient manner. So I encourage all stakeholders, at national, regional and local level, managing authorities, banks - because they have the capacity and expertise to find that balance between grants and financial instruments. In that regard, the technical assistance that Mrs Tomašić talked about so much is very important. For this period, you are well aware that we in the European Commission have worked closely with the Member States to ensure that this funding period will bear fruit, but I do agree with you that we can do more. As for us, we encourage all Member States, help them to improve their administrative capacity, but also to establish the right legislation. As I told you at the beginning, we are trying to identify new priorities for technical assistance. My personal opinion and that of DG REGIO is that this technical assistance should be advanced at the beginning of the funding period in order to support the preparation of the programs in time, in order to avoid the delays we are now experiencing in the Member States, to facilitate the exchange of experience between regions and to join forces with the newly created Support Service for Structural Reforms, to work together on the ground.I look forward to our collaboration in the coming months for the debates on the post-2020 budget to ensure that the 500 million Europeans will benefit from the policy they deserve, to ensure a better life for them and their children., it is, I think, our responsibility as politicians and I assure you that I, personally, and my services will do everything we can to bring our input in this regard.Thank you very much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 43, "date": "2017-05-18.json", "name": "Andrey NOVAKOV", "mepid": "107212", "text": "rapporteur. - I want to thank everyone who took part in the debate today.

Hundreds of millions are invested in European municipalities every day to solve people's problems. And these are facts that we cannot ignore. Of course there are problems to solve, of course there is room for improvement. Can we make procedures faster, easier and more understandable? Maybe. Can we make cohesion policy more visible? I guess you can.

However, the resources that have been devoted to it over the years have never allowed cohesion policy to do its job.

I support Mr Novakov's report because it also expresses my conviction that the grant system must be maintained in certain areas. Grants should be the preferred form of investment, especially in building public infrastructure, social services, but also research and innovation. Of course, Member States and regions must be left free to choose the share of grants and financial instruments in implementing their priorities. At the same time, I must say that the combination of these two types of tools still offers unexplored potential.

In the period from 2014 to 2020, the European Commission and the Member States have at their disposal EUR 14.6 billion of technical assistance under investment and technical funds. I believe that increasing funding for technical assistance is a prerequisite for all other economic activities and strategic investments. The establishment of efficient administrative and infrastructural conditions has an extremely favorable effect on the development of many economic branches. In order to preserve the transparency of the allocation of funds and take into account the regional level, it is necessary to involve and inform citizens, especially by using technical assistance at the national level to train local capacities.

As everyone has been saying, as a consequence Hakainde Hichilema, the main leader of the opposition party, who did not recognize President Lungu's election victory, was arrested, imprisoned and charged with high treason. It is a crime for which the maximum sentence in Zambia is the death penalty. As we know, no execution has been carried out in this country for 20 years, but so far such the highest penalty is still possible in Zambia for a crime defined as high treason. As we have also noted numerous reports of political motivation in relation to the charges against Hichilem, and given that the trial will start as early as this week, I would like to call for an urgent political dialogue between the two parties with the support of international partners, including the European Union and regional organizations.

The European Union values highly its partnership with Zambia. We are proud of our significant contribution to that country’s development and are firmly committed to remaining a key partner. The European Union is also aware of the various challenges the country is facing and supports its ambitious economic and governance reform agenda.  You may recall the EU’s involvement, through the deployment of an EU election observation mission, led by the honourable Member Cécile Kyenge, who has just taken the floor. We are very grateful for the work she has done. We are advocating implementation of the mission’s recommendations, in particular in response to its concerns relating to freedom of expression and assembly.  Zambia has traditionally been a peaceful and democratic nation in a neighbourhood so often marked by political instability and human rights violations. It is therefore of even greater concern that Zambia’s democratic trajectory is being questioned, particularly since the highly—contested elections in August 2016, which revealed the polarised nature of the country. The arrest of the opposition leader, Hakainde Hichilema, on 11 April resulted in increased political tensions, to which the European Union was quick to respond by calling on all parties to refrain from any action or rhetoric likely to aggravate the situation. The European Union, in close coordination with the Member States, will further convey a strong message to both the government and the opposition to play a constructive role and to engage in a dialogue to restore trust in support of an inclusive political environment.  Regarding the ongoing proceedings against Mr Hichilema, the European Union calls upon the government of Zambia to ensure transparency, independence of the judiciary and the right to a fair trial and due process, according to international human rights law. Making Zambia’s institutions accountable and inclusive is vital for upholding its democratic credentials and political stability. The European Union will continue to engage with our Zambian partners through all political and diplomatic means, at all levels, calling upon the wisdom and sense of responsibility of all parties to avoid further reputational damage to Zambia’s strong democratic traditions.

Ethiopia faces multiple challenges and a deteriorating humanitarian situation, including several droughts and a cholera outbreak, but also persisting pockets of violence throughout the country. The European Union is aware of the difficult situation that the Oromo People’s Congress and other key opposition parties face and has repeatedly highlighted these concerns to the government. The EU delegation in Ethiopia closely follows the case of Dr Merera. They attend his trials and have regular contact with his lawyers. The delegation equally monitors trials of other opposition leaders detained and has regular contacts with their remaining leadership. The situation has further deteriorated under the state of emergency, and the stability of the country and of the wider region remains at serious risk. Ethiopia is an important partner, and the situation warrants the EU’s close attention. The EU-Ethiopia Strategic Engagement is the right framework to address and follow issues of concern. The visit of High Representative Mrs Mogherini to Addis Ababa in March was an opportunity to discuss political developments with the Prime Minister, emphasising the imperative to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms under the state of emergency as well as for a credible political dialogue with the opposition. She reiterated him again in the margins of the Somalia conference in London, and he was grateful for the EU’s continuous engagement. It is important to note that the first dialogue at the EU-Ethiopia Strategic Engagement was the governance and human rights sectoral dialogue. It was formally launched in the presence of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, during his visit to Addis Ababa from 4 to 6 April. Topics discussed included due process of law and detention conditions; youth empowerment and children’s rights, including female genital mutilation; and migrants’ rights. We are now working on concrete follow-up, in particular on the strengthening of independent civil society, the establishment of a strong political dialogue, and the improvement of conditions in detention centres. Since this visit, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission has reported to the Parliament on its findings on the violence that led to the current state of emergency. We welcomed the recommendation that security personnel responsible for the excessive use of force should be held accountable. We have encouraged the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission to work with the independent civil society organisations and human rights defenders and to publicly share all of their reports. We also welcome the recent visit of UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Mr Al Hussein, to the country and strongly encourage Ethiopia to cooperate with UN special procedures. The EU continues to stress the need to address guidance of the population and encourage tangible changes to laws and practices to ensure more outlets for citizens to express their views and concerns freely and peacefully, including through independent media, political parties and civil society. The arrest of senior leaders of the opposition such as Dr Merera is detrimental to a process of reconciliation and dialogue. We have called for the release of the leaders of the opposition and supported calls for independent investigations into all acts of violence. The European Union stands ready to work together in addressing these issues. Given the enormous task that the country is facing in terms of humanitarian challenges and its key role in issues of common concerns – regional peace and security, migration, climate change – we must be ready to support them to foster democracy and prosperity and we think that one cannot exist without the other.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 90, "date": "2017-05-18.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Now, on behalf of Vice-President / High Representative Mogherini, I would like to tell you how sorry I am to see that, after our many years of discussing this same issue here, the situation is getting worse instead of improving. The situation is on the verge of catastrophe. The country is consumed by anarchy and disorder, with atrocious acts of violence commonplace. Civilians are being deliberately and systematically attacked, often with an ethnic intent, by a range of armed opposition groups, and notably in large offensives by the Sudan People’s Liberation Army. A hundred people are dying each month and some 1.8 million refugees have fled to neighbouring countries, while almost 2 million persons are internally displaced. Famine has been declared in parts of the country. The European Union is doing everything possible to encourage peace. It undertakes ongoing political dialogue with the transitional government to urge implementation of the 2015 Peace Agreement. We are fully engaged with regional efforts, through the African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development, to end the conflict. The European Union has provided almost EUR 0.5 billion in humanitarian assistance to South Sudan since the conflict started in December 2013. Our support to the region has been increased to address a massive influx of refugees. The European Union has imposed an arms embargo against South Sudan and is lobbying for the UN Security Council to follow it. The European Union is appalled at the gross violation of human rights and international humanitarian law perpetrated by all parties with complete impunity. It has encouraged the African Union to establish a ‘hybrid court’ for South Sudan, as envisaged in the Peace Agreement, as soon as possible. Let me reiterate today our messages to all parties. There can be no military solution. All parties must observe the ceasefire in full. The United Nations peacekeeping mission in South Sudan must be allowed to exercise its mandate without restriction, so all parties must allow unfettered humanitarian access to those in need, and attacks on aid workers must stop. The national dialogue launched by President Kiir must be transformed into an inclusive political process, truly open to all parties, which is deemed credible by the South Sudanese people. People’s lives – mainly the lives of South Sudanese people – hang in the balance, threatened by violence, famine and destitution. The European Union will continue to deploy all instruments available – political pressure, sanctions, development assistance, international justice – with a view to encouraging the parties to replace conflict with dialogue. Thank you for your attention. I look forward to good news.

I would like to thank my colleagues who supported this proposal with 43 signatures, and I take this opportunity to thank you that the interpellation saw the light of day in this plenary session. I am also pleased that, as of today, my fellow Members from the countries most affected by this issue are present here. In any case, what we want to point out is the obvious difference in product quality between the Western European market and the Central European and Eastern market. Studies have already been completed in many countries and this has been proven. In some countries these studies are still being done, but in any case there is an obvious difference and we want to point to the single European market and we believe that all consumers must have equal rights, strive for cohesion, strive for equality and that is why we have raised this interpellation to daily order. We would like our children to enjoy the same standards in that common Europe that we have all worked so hard for together. My two questions to the Commission expressed in this interpellation are: Given the single market, what measures does the Commission intend to take to eliminate single market sharing practices? And the second question: Will the Commission revise European Union legislation to protect consumers by removing double standards in the quality of products sold in Central, Eastern and Western Europe? The deadline for response was April 12. We didn't get it. That is one of the reasons why this item came up on the agenda. We have also requested the initiation, that is, the initiation of a change in legislation related to this issue, so I expect, after the discussion this afternoon, that Ms. Crețu may also respond that the Commission intends to continue with this issue. Once again, thank you to all colleagues who participated in this and to a colleague from Croatia who started a study on this issue so that we proved that there really are differences.This has already been proven in Slovakia, it has been proven in the Czech Republic, Hungary.Our agriculture ministers also supported this issue at the Council meeting, and I believe that you, as the Commission, will answer this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 156, "date": "2017-05-18.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, dear rapporteur, I am glad to speak on behalf of Commissioner Věra Jourová, my colleague, on this very important and so sensitive issue, as you rightly raised. It is very important to discuss it. Existing EU legislation aims to ensure a high level of consumer protection, safety, and correct and reliable consumer information. We think that only safe food products are allowed on the EU market – as we said, we have a single market – and of course, consumers must be accurately informed and not misled about the composition and characteristics of food offered for sale. We have general labelling rules and requirements to that effect, and it is EU legislation which ensures that producers have to make a complete list of ingredients that enables the consumers to be fully informed of the composition of the food product. This being said, as long as products comply with EU legal requirements and their labelling does not mislead consumers as to the main characteristics, companies are not prevented from differentiating products according to the market. There is no legal basis, unfortunately, at EU level to challenge differences in food composition in individual Member States, as long as the relevant food information is not misleading. However, should a trader advertise a product as being the same in several Member States, but at the same time deliberately reduce the quality of the product in some of these countries compared to others, this practice could be addressed under the Directive on unfair commercial practices by the competent national authority. EU consumer law allows national enforcement authorities or courts to end specific misleading commercial practices if they consider that they are harming consumers. After the investigations and many events coming from this House, the Commission has called on Member States to provide further data and evidence in order to assess the existence and extent of these alleged practices and possible reasons for them. So far, the Commission has received 21 replies from the Member States. According to the received replies, the issue of dual quality is considered a big problem, especially in the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia. The main products concern food, laundry detergents and pet food. The investigations carried out in several countries showed said the labelling of these products corresponds to their composition. In other Member States there is no particular data or evidence related to the issue of dual quality so far. In order to tackle this important issue, more cooperation among enforcement agencies is needed, so as to elaborate an objective mapping and to compare products sold in several Member States. The Commission intends to provide the results of this mapping for the next SHERPA meeting of the high-level forum for a better functioning of the food supply chain on 20 June, in line with a conclusion of the European Council of 9 March 2017. This forum will enable, for the first time, an exchange of views between all concerned actors, such as consumer representatives, industry at various stages of the supply chain, Member States’ authorities and the Commission. Some of you have called on the Commission to propose a specific legislation to prohibit dual quality. In our view, the reinforcement of existing laws should be strengthened in the first place. I trust that the on-going debate on the process of collecting evidence will raise the awareness of all concerned players on the issue and help address it to the benefit of all European citizens and consumers. On our part, we will build on the results of the consultation of national authorities and the outcome of debate in the high-level forum.

Commissioner! The topic of our discussion today only seems trivial, because in fact it concerns a huge number of European Union citizens - both in my country, in Poland, but also in many other new Member States - who are clearly discriminated against by producers of food or cleaning products. We are now sure that the common opinion about the lower quality of products offered on the markets of Central and Eastern European countries is based on many studies and analyzes. Consumers in my country have had similar concerns about the quality of food, toiletries, cleaning products and disinfectants for many years. However, the most outrageous in this case is the policy of many large concerns. Firstly, they mislead consumers by not providing reliable information about the different composition of the same products in the west and east of Europe, differences which, for example in relation to food, may even have a negative impact on public health. Secondly, the prices of lower quality products available, among others, in Poland are in many cases higher than the prices of their counterparts in the West. The treatment of consumers in my region of Europe as second-class customers undoubtedly deserves a reaction at the European level. Nobody expects complete unification of the composition of all products across Europe, but we cannot accept such far-reaching differences between the composition and quality of the same goods offered on the common market but in different Member States.

If I am here, it is because I am from Strasbourg and I want to support the holding of the session in Strasbourg as well as the work on Thursday afternoon. Moreover, the session could even extend until Friday to make Strasbourg the sole seat in parliamentary work. The question asked by the Slovak and Hungarian governments on the complaints of consumers in these countries is legitimate, but it seems to me to be poorly put. Indeed, the tests carried out by these governments do not show any infringement in respect of consumer health protection and in their information as provided for by European legislation. We are therefore not in a case of fraud or even outright deception. It is about using the prestige of a brand and its quality standards, recognized over the years in Western Europe, to sell a lower quality product, adapt the price to the standard of local life and preserve the margins of the parent company. Beyond this marketing lie, we need to think more deeply about the issue of food. Multinationals are not ideological, they pragmatically adapt their production conditions to the economy and the local market. The Commission is pursuing a globalist logic of standardization, sanitization, standardization which substitutes brands for the land, which weakens our diet and gradually causes our countries to lose their culinary identity. This policy obviously benefits the big multinationals in the food industry. The only long-term solution to this problem is to relocate production closer to consumers, to give back to our fellow citizens the tastes and flavors of their territory and to leave States the right to be more rigorous on quality standards, on appellations of origin and on the protection of their culinary identity.We must thus break with free trade, which accelerates this race for junk food by opening our markets to fruit and vegetables picked tasteless, transported thousands of kilometers in refrigerated containers.We must also put an end to the monopoly of central purchasing bodies and generalized tenders.We are faced with this situation.I myself have established large-scale distribution and I am unhappy about this policy which is being carried out, which ultimately leads to standardization and standardization and which bypasses local productions during calls foroffers because they are not competitive.Our peoples have the right to food sovereignty and to respect for their culinary identity, which are far more important issues than the brand dispute.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 164, "date": "2017-05-18.json", "name": "Alojz PETERLE", "mepid": "23693", "text": "   – Mr President, dear colleagues, a quarter of a century after the fall of the Iron Curtain, we see that all the walls between the West and the East still have not been pulled down.

I'm not surprised by reactions in the Western press that double standards were \"fake news number one.\" To call analyzes carried out in the state laboratories of the Member States 'fake news' is in itself indicative of the mood among producers in Western Europe. If citizens prefer food with a different and local taste, expensive producers, then produce it under a different brand of raw materials in the country and hire labor there! More than 2 months ago, the Bulgarian Food Safety Agency undertook analyzes on the topic. In just 2 days I was able to identify similar differences in several products.

Yes, Mr Jakovčić and all my colleagues, I am very sensitive as a person when it comes to two standards, two qualities, two speeds and so on. It is very important to say that, from my point of view, I do not consider it acceptable that identically-branded products would be deliberately advertised and sold as being the same in different Member States but in fact with a lower quality in one country or another. It is not only about our health but that of our children and next generations. In such a scenario, I think people will rightly feel treated as second-class citizens by industry and perceive that there is no benefit from the single market for them. This said, I must repeat that the companies are not prevented from differentiated products within the EU legislation to better adapt them to the local taste and other conditions – including local market environment – such as competition pressures. As I said in my introductory speech, there is an on-going debate and a process of collecting evidence. This debate will raise awareness, I hope, including for our debate for the benefit of the EU citizens. However, the EU legislation is clear: a product marketed as being the same in several Member States when in fact it presents significant differences in certain countries may be considered as unfairly marketed under consumer protection legislation.
