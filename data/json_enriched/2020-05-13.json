I would therefore like to begin this plenary session with a word of praise and thanks to the women and men in white shirts who have provided essential health services with dedication, courage and humanity in such difficult times. It is our common duty to enable them to carry out their work safely and efficiently. We have already made hospitals, human resources, machinery and medical equipment available from one country to another, thanks also to the work of the Civil Protection: an effort of solidarity that represents a wealth for all our countries. Today we feel the need to strengthen the European Union's powers in the field of health: this is a commitment that we must make before our citizens. Parliament has called for a European health response mechanism to prepare for and respond in a common and coordinated way to any kind of health crisis. The Covid-19 pandemic has shown the need for a more proactive public health policy and greater and better cooperation to build resilient and accessible health care systems, as well as, above all, the need for greater solidarity in Europe. Seventy years ago, on 9 May 1950, solidarity between six European countries pushed for a Europe of peace and security. A Europe which, as Robert Schuman said, 'will arise from concrete achievements that create a facto solidarity'. This vision was the only way to ensure lasting peace and improve people's lives. It was an ambitious but also very pragmatic vision, based on the horrors of war and the sacrifices made to put an end to it. Seventy-five years of peace, a common project, with many future challenges to face. Work is only just beginning and with women, men and young people, capable of developing solidarity, as they have shown in this period of serious emergency, our task will be easier. We have a great responsibility before us: we must live up to the expectations of european citizens and relaunch a great reflection on the future of Europe, together with immediate responses to the problems we face. This crisis is teaching us many things, but above all that only together can we start again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 5, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-05-13.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "  I would first like to remind you of a number of precautionary measures that have been taken to respect social distancing.

Dear colleagues, the coronavirus crisis has been a before and after in the future of our society. The fight against the virus has forced us to do things we would never have imagined: confinement in our own homes—often away from our loved ones—, the halicking of a large part of economic activity, and the loss of numerous jobs. The suspension of the way we all led our lives gives the measure of the effort that has been required of the citizenry, and we have to live up to our representatives.  Companies, the self-employed, have also been trying for months to show the best of themselves so that they can survive this crisis and continue and continue their business once everything happens.  Institutions, to live up to it, we have to give voice and defend those interests of our companies. And the issue at hand here is an excellent opportunity to do that.  Companies incorporated in the form of European public limited companies will not be able to comply with the current legal obligation to hold their shareholder meetings in the first six months of the year. The restrictions imposed on us by the pandemic prevent this.  That is why the European Commission's proposal is purely common sense.  It is essentially a question of reforming the legislation in this area to allow, in this year 2020, an exception to that rule for shareholder meetings, so that the deadline for constating them is extended by six more months, until 31 December this year. Also that the use of digital media is encouraged so that they can also be celebrated remotely.  It is, as I say, an inescapable and necessary reform. And so is it that it is dealt with by the emergency procedure and is approved immediately. It is not permissible that today these companies do not know for sure whether they should hold their shareholder meetings next month, with all the health risks that this entails, or whether they will have to wait and be able to hold them in the next six months. We need to send a message that makes it clear that our commitment is to help and protect.  Europe is playing its future and credibility in every crisis, and every response we give to the problems of each sector, to every group and to every citizen represents what this House has to represent.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the House for giving me again this opportunity to take the floor here. This crisis is unprecedented and it means that we need to take unprecedented decisions. And that's why I am convinced that a very strong cooperation between the democratic and legitimate European institutions will be vital in the next few weeks, in the next months. It's an opportunity for me today to share with you some comments after the fourth video conference after the last European Council. As you probably know, we have taken some very strong directions. The first goal was to endorse the proposals made by the ministers of finance in order to mobilize more than EUR 540 billion in order to support the workers, the companies, but also the Member States. We have asked the ministers of finance to implement this decision by June 1st. Of course, we all know here, but also in the European Council, that it's not enough. And I would say that this European Council was the opportunity to shift from crisis management in the short-term to more and more the mid-term and long-term vision about what we need to do, especially in order to have a strong debate about the orientations for the recovery strategy and, I would add, for the transformation strategy of our economic and social model. This fourth video conference was also an opportunity to discuss on the basis of the roadmap for economic recovery and transformation prepared together with the President of the Commission. I have had the opportunity earlier at this European Council to present the four chapters that we are putting on the table and I would like to focus here in particular on two aspects which have been the subject of debate and which must continue to mobilise us in the coming weeks and months. The first point remains the importance of being fully mobilised on the issue of the internal market. How can we strengthen the internal market and, above all, can we consider that the challenges that existed before this pandemic have not disappeared with this pandemic: the climate agenda and the digital agenda.  I would remind you that, just a few months before the start of this pandemic, very strong and, I would like to say, even historic decisions, were taken in particular by the European Council, with the very strong support of the European Parliament, to consider that the climate neutrality of the European Union should be a mobilising objective to support our businesses. , to support our economic and social transformation. The same goes for this digital ambition. Continuing to act more than ever is going to be necessary in this direction, considering that climate and digital agenda must be at the centre of the common project we want to implement. The internal market is also the debate on the strategic autonomy of the European Union, and we feel in this European Council an increasingly shared orientation to consider that we must learn from the past, learn lessons and bring production capacity back to Europe, certainly in the strategic field. I want to say, to paraphrase what has been mentioned in the European Council, let us bring back the made in Europe. There is one very central issue here: the crisis has demonstrated the importance of being mobilized on this subject and having a strategy that incorporates that reasoning. In addition to this important commitment to the internal market and having made the request to the European Commission to present a report in the near future on how the different European ecosystems are already affected and how they may probably be affected in the coming weeks, so that we can have information that is as useful as possible.  The second point, the single market, but also the second important point, is of course the financing and the essential importance to develop a very strong and ambitious strategy, to mobilize more means based on two very strong tools. The first one is the European budget and we had in the last few weeks, the last month, many debates together about this orientation for the next European budget. More than ever, we need to take decisions. We need to adapt also our strategy in order to take consideration into the consequences, the huge consequences, of this crisis. But it's not enough - the next European budget, and that's why we have taken this very strong commitment to work together in order to launch a recovery fund, in order to be able to mobilize more means, more money, to identify what are the priorities in the near future. And in this context, of these two instruments that need to be mobilized, some, I was in fact, had called for the idea of mobilizing a Marshall Plan-type strategy. I proposed, I want to do it here again, Mr. President, that we can work on what I call, as far as I am concerned, a De Gasperi plan, named after one of the Italian founding fathers, in order to work together on the financing modalities, which must be the subject of debate. How are we going to fund it? How are we going to identify the height of the means that are needed? And how will we identify the interaction between this stimulus and transformation fund on the one hand and the next European budget? And above all, how will we agree on how to mobilize the means? How, with common sense, effectively, will we mobilize the means that are necessary to succeed in this economic recovery? Finally, apart from this debate on recovery, on the transformation which will have to continue at the outset of the proposals that the European Commission will make taking into account this pandemic, which will lead the Commission to put new proposals on the table, alongside these provisions, there is another point that I would like to highlight at this time which I am given to share with you. It is the importance of not losing sight of the importance that the fundamental objective of the European project since its launch after the Second World War has been not only peace and prosperity, but this idea that it is together, by cooperating together, by working together for more solidarity and unity, that we can meet the challenges we face.  And the driving force behind this European project has been, throughout the last decades too, this question of European convergence: to reduce disparities, to reduce differences. And, more than ever, in the face of this crisis, we feel how essential it will be to convince all Member States that this crisis should not be a reason, a pretext, an excuse to aggravate differences at European level, to aggravate differences and disparities at European level, but on the contrary, must strengthen us in this common will to work for more convergence , for more cohesion and for more European integration.  More than ever, I share the conviction that this crisis reveals how much more cooperation, more convergence, more integration and not the other way around. Because we know that the opposite will mean much more fragility and much more incapacity. We see this when we are faced with a global impact that requires answers that must be global naturally. Finally, I would like to tell you that there is another extremely important point. We are seeing the first impacts already very hard in economic terms, for example in the tourism sector, for example in the air transport sector and in many other sectors as well. We can see that for the next few days, the next few weeks, there is a need to work actively on the basis of the proposals that are put forward by the Commission, recommendations, even if Member States have decision-making capacity on the issue of borders, on the issue of tourism, it is important that very quickly, on the basis of these proposals that are put forward, which are put forward , the Member States sit together around the same table, their sleeves rolled up, to try to have consistency, to also have the capacity to meet this challenge.  I call for the reopening of European borders as soon as possible, taking of course the precautionary measures that need to be taken, but the issue of the free movement of people, an extremely important issue, the ability to gradually reopen our capacity for economic development is also extremely essential from a social point of view. And I hope that in the coming days we can really make progress, by allowing Member States to be around the same table to take decisions together, in a coherent, synchronized way and to show our European resilience. Finally, I would like to tell you, although not directly linked to the debates of the last European Council, that it seems to me central, as I address the European Parliament, to say solemnly, as President of the European Council, that the primacy of European law is indeed a central subject when it comes to advancing European ideas, advancing European cooperation and advancing European cooperation and , in this respect, the role of the European Court of Justice is a central role in ensuring a uniform interpretation of European law. 70 years ago, Robert Schuman expressed, through a declaration which, even today, constitutes a foundation, constitutes a foundation for this European project, values which, for the time, were extremely innovative at a time when, even a few years before, nations were at war, generations distrusted each other, had made the choice of the retreat that had brought the tragedy.  I will not comment on whether what we are facing is in the realm of war. Everyone finds the capacity to develop motivation to face the challenges we face, but I certainly see something in common in this situation more than seventy years ago and the situation today. We are facing a global crisis, a serious crisis, an unprecedented crisis.  And, just as at the time, it took resources, creativity, innovation, audacity, courage, courage, coming out of the blinders that had, for decades, pulled the world down, in the same way, more than ever, the question is whether this political generation, this generation of citizens will have the capacity for audacity, innovation, creativity and courage to ensure that we can , in the drama of this crisis, in the pain and misfortune faced by so many families exposed very directly, that we find the resource and the transformative energy to make this European project which, from my point of view, is probably one of the most beautiful political ideas in the history of women and men, so that we can make this European project an ability to meet this challenge and bring what is to the at the heart of this project, ultimately, the dignity of people to bring in caring societies, societies that are brought together so that they can look to the future with more optimism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 17, "date": "2020-05-13.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   présidente de la Commission. – Monsieur le Président, cher Charles Michel, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, dans les soixante-dix ans qui ont suivi la déclaration Schuman, les crises et les défis ne sont pas inconnus à l’Europe. Comme vous l’avez tout justement dit, à bien des égards, la devise de l’Europe a toujours été non seulement «Unie dans la diversité», mais aussi «Unie dans l’adversité».  Et aujourd’hui, dans cette période d’adversité et en réponse à cette crise, l’Europe a plus que jamais besoin d’unité, de détermination et d’ambition. Et c’est dans cet esprit que la Commission travaille sur un plan de relance ambitieux pour l’Europe, comme vous le demandez dans votre résolution aujourd’hui.  Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, nous savons tous pour quoi il est nécessaire d’agir et, au cours de ces dernières semaines, vous m’avez souvent entendue parler de ce que l’Europe doit faire. Aujourd’hui, je veux vous parler du comment. Je veux vous présenter l’architecture et les principales caractéristiques du plan de relance ambitieux pour l’Europe sur lequel nous travaillons. Mais, pour faire cela, nous devons d’abord bien comprendre l’anatomie de cette crise très particulière. Allow me three remarks ahead of the analysis. We have had economic slowdowns before, but we’ve never had an economic shutdown like the last three months. Our economies have been on hold. Supply chains have been disrupted severely. Demand has collapsed. The truth is that we will not just go back to ‘business as usual’ soon. Our economies and societies will open slowly, cautiously, gradually. While schools stay shut we all know that most parents will have to continue with ‘home-office’, and while social distancing measures rightly stay in place, businesses will have to rethink their workplaces and the way they work. In other words, we will recover but it will take time.  My second remark. The virus is the same in every Member State, yes, but the capacity to respond and absorb the shock is very different. For instance, we all know countries and regions with economies that are built on client—facing services like, for example, tourism or culture, have suffered way more. We should not forget that those who were hit first by the virus were often hit the hardest, because it was the painful experience and the full transparency of Italy and Spain in dealing with a pandemic that helped others to brace themselves for the impact. My third point. Every Member State has supported workers and companies as best as possible. Also, thanks to the European level being fast and forceful, we triggered the general escape clause, we gave full flexibility on all the structural funds and full flexibility on state aid. But it is also true that each Member State has a different fiscal space, so the use of state aid is also very different from Member State to Member State. What we are starting to observe now is an unlevelling of the playing field in the Single Market. To all that, we need a European response, and because it is a real European recovery focusing on European priorities, it is essential that the European Parliament plays its full role. For me, it goes without saying that this Parliament must provide democratic accountability and have its say on the entire recovery package, just as it does on the European budget. That is what we’re going to discuss today.  So let me plunge into the recovery package, which consists of two parts. First of all there will be the European budget, the so—called MFF, that is very well known to you. Secondly, and on top of the budget, will be a recovery instrument funded through a larger headroom. This headroom fixes the maximum amount of money that the Commission can borrow on the capital markets with the guarantees of the Member States, so backed by the Member States. Just as important, the entirety of the money of the recovery instrument will be channelled through the European budget, that is, through European programmes. This is why – and I repeat it – the European Parliament will have the same say on how the recovery money is spent as it does on how the MFF is spent.  Now, where does the recovery money go to? It will be spent across three pillars. The first pillar will focus on supporting Member States to recover, to repair, and to come out stronger from this crisis. The bulk of the money will be spent within this first pillar on the new recovery and resilience instrument that is created to fund, in the Member States, key public investment and reforms, but they have to be aligned with our European policy. In other words, thus we are paving the way to a climate—neutral, digitalised and resilient Europe.  This will be done through the European Semester. It will be available to all Member States, whether they are in the euro area or not. And it will be focused on those parts of the Union that have been most affected and where resilience needs are the greatest. This is one part of the first pillar, and the bulk of the money goes there. Within this first pillar there is also a second part, and that is the proposal by the Commission to top up the cohesion funds. This will be above the usual cohesion envelope within the MFF. This top up will be allocated based on the severity of the economic and social impact of the crisis. The second pillar. The second pillar is about kick—starting the economy and helping private investment to get moving again. We already knew before the crisis that we also need major private investment in key sectors and key technologies – 5G, artificial intelligence, clean hydrogen, off-shore renewable energies, you name it. The only thing this crisis changed is that it has made this need greater than it was before. This is why we will strengthen InvestEU. We will also create for the first time a new Strategic Investment Facility. This facility will help invest in the key value chains that are crucial for our future resilience and strategic autonomy. We’ve seen during the crisis how dependent we were on global supply chains, for example in the pharmaceutical sector, so Europe must be able to produce critical medicine itself.  But for all this, we also need healthy companies in Europe to invest in. This is why we’ll also propose, in this second pillar, a new Solvency Instrument. This will help match the recapitalisation needs of healthy companies which have been put at risk as a result of the lockdown, wherever they are located in the European Union.  Now the third and last pillar. The third pillar is about learning the most immediate lessons of the crisis. Over the last month we’ve seen what is important, what has worked well and what needs to be improved. So we will strengthen programmes that have proven their value in the crisis, such as RescEU or such as Horizon Europe. We will also create a new dedicated health programme, and we will make sure that we can support our partners by strengthening our instruments for neighbourhood development and international cooperation and for pre-accession assistance. Honourable Members, in a nutshell, this is what the recovery instrument looks like. It will be focused on where there is the greatest needs and the greatest potential. The recovery instrument is short—term and concentrated on the first years of recovery. It will include grants. It will include the possibility to frontload part of the investment, still this year, using proven financing models based on national guarantees. We should not forget that we’re not starting from scratch. The recovery instrument will complement the three important safety nets that were mentioned and agreed by the leaders in April – the SURE programme, the finance availability from the European Investment Bank and the European Stability Mechanism. Together with our MFF, this will be the ambitious answer Europe needs: an answer that includes the new own resources that we need in our budget, just as the Commission proposed in 2018; an answer that reflects our common values with a mechanism to protect the rule of law; an answer that is built on necessity but is designed for the future. Das heißt: eine Antwort, die aus der Krise geboren ist, die aber in die Zukunft investieren und dienen muss. Das stärkt nicht nur die Solidarität zwischen den Ländern und den Menschen, sondern das stärkt auch die Solidarität zwischen den Generationen. Denn, meine Damen und Herren, früher oder später werden Wissenschaftler und Forscherinnen einen Impfstoff gegen das Coronavirus finden.  Aber gegen den Klimawandel gibt es keinen Impfstoff, und deswegen muss Europa jetzt in eine saubere Zukunft investieren. Unsere Investitionen in den Wiederaufbau haben ihren Preis, und dieser Preis ist eine steigende Schuldenlast. Wenn wir aber die Schulden erhöhen müssen, für die unsere Kinder in Zukunft aufkommen müssen, dann ist es das Mindeste, dass wir mit dem Geld in ihre Zukunft investieren, dass wir den Klimawandel angehen und dass wir die Klimabelastung senken und eben nicht noch etwas draufpacken.  Deshalb: Im Ausgang der Krise dürfen wir nicht in die alten Muster zurückfallen. Wir dürfen nicht den Wiederaufbau in eine Wirtschaft von gestern stecken, sondern wir sollten jetzt mutig die Chance nutzen, um eine moderne, eine saubere, eine gesunde Wirtschaft aufzubauen, die die Lebensgrundlage unserer nächsten Generation, unserer Kinder sichert.  Meine Damen und Herren, die europäische Ebene allein kann nicht alle Wunden heilen, die diese Krise hinterlässt. Aber wir nehmen unseren Teil der Verantwortung wahr, indem wir heute die Lasten zwischen den Mitgliedstaaten ausgleichen und gleichzeitig sicherstellen, dass diese gewaltige Anstrengung auch auf das Konto der jüngeren Generation einzahlt. Das ist unsere Aufgabe heute. Und ich bin fest davon überzeugt, dass ein einiges Europa der Aufgabe gewachsen ist. Lang lebe Europa! Long live Europe!

Today, I want to speak first about people, their hearts, their courage, their efforts, their fears, and probably also their pain: the nurse in Madrid who was infected while helping a patient, the doctor in Bergamo who had to decide about life and death in the past weeks, and probably the young researcher in Tübingen, who worked day and night trying to find a possible cure to stop this pandemic. I mention these examples to show that the heroes of this crisis are not politicians, managers or media stars. The stars have been the millions of Europeans who helped, engaged and took care of all of us. Thank you very much, from the bottom of our heart, all of you. No words can ever be enough to thank you for your engagement. Now we have to do our job as politicians. Now it is our turn. In the EPP Group, we strongly support the general architecture which is now on the table: to have an ambitious, future—orientated MFF – and we add a recovery plan, a recovery fund, which really delivers on the demands of today’s European Union. Speaking about the architecture of this new mechanism, for us, as the EPP, the key element is to fight for a democratic budget, a budget decided by the people represented here in this Chamber, a budget based on solidarity among people and nations in the European Union, a budget that is honest with the people and a budget that cares for the people. ‘We want to have our sovereignty back’ was one of the main messages in the Brexit campaign. I tell you that this successful message reflected on the problem that people don’t feel involved in the European decision—making process. And that’s why it is so important that it is not Brussels that decides about the recovery fund, a kind of external power deciding. No: my MEP decides about the future of the European Union and about the recovery programme. It must be in the hands of those who are elected for this. No budget without democratic legitimacy. That is one of the principles in the European way of life. This promise was given by the European Commission and I would say that now is the time to deliver. To the Council I want to say that now is not the time for institutional battles in this field. I think it is the time to guarantee, also from a Council point of view, a democratic Europe as a principle for the future. A second consideration for us, the EPP Group, is that people don’t care about procedure. They only care about concrete projects and concrete support. In this spirit of the past weeks, a spirit of solidarity among Europeans, we also have to focus on the ones who really needs our help the most, the most affected regions, and especially the young generation. I want to put this at the centre of my second point, namely that we have already faced, in the last 12 years, a kind of lost generation in the European Union, where millions of young people – well—educated, well-prepared people – had no chance to really succeed in the labour market. And I want to underline that Europe cannot again allow us to have a lost generation facing the future of the European Union. That’s why the investments are needed. Europe has to give the young generation hope. The third aspect I want to underline is to be honest regarding the MFF. We have to keep the promises that we gave to the voters last year. There is one aspect, which Ursula von der Leyen has already rightly underlined, that is about future investments – climate change, the question of stronger investments in research, the digital world, education, the fight against cancer or today against corona – and to do it together as common activities. And we must not forget our regions and farmers. I want to underline this. We must be fair with everybody. Today cohesion and agriculture policy is one of the tools where we already show solidarity in today’s European Union. That’s why it must be properly financed as well. As a final point, I want to underline that we have to take care of the preparation for future emergency situations we will face in the European Union. We cannot promise that we will be able to avoid another pandemic in the future. Nobody can do so. But we can make sure that Europe is much better prepared for the next pandemic or the next crisis. We need flexibility. We need own resources. We have to create tools for a quick and decisive response if there is an unexpected situation in front of us. After the crisis, we want to see a united Europe where all parts of our Union will economically recover. After the crisis, we want to see a united Europe which invests in future projects and which creates an economic future for our young generation. And, after the crisis, we want to see at a global level a Europe that is the first out of the crisis. That is what we want to achieve, and probably this is the Schuman moment of our generation, also having your words in mind. We have to be clear on this and we have to be motivated by the courage we saw from the nurses, from the doctors, and from all those who delivered in the last weeks. That is what we should use as an example.

We've had some very difficult weeks in every country. Many of our fellow citizens have lost their lives, many of them to family members and loved ones; and today millions of people face great fear and uncertainty about the future. It is therefore welcome that, despite the complicated circumstances, this Parliament has been able to continue to do its job with responsibility. Thank you to President Sassoli, who has made this Parliament an example of solidarity, and also thanks to all the officials and civil servants of the house.  I think we are aware of the historical responsibility we have at this point. Because when citizens feel helpless and left to their fate in the worst moments, easy recipes, populism, nationalisms, and democracy really gain ground. That's why the decision we have to make in the coming days is important.  Despite the Council's initial reaction that ministers and heads of government seemed to pass the ball to each other so as not to have to decide, finally on 23 April there was a positive signal that all European citizens understood: a European reconstruction plan with a financial plan in order to be linked to the multiannual financial framework.  Now it is up to the Commission and, more importantly, we demand that the Commission be ambitious. Tomorrow we are going to vote on a joint resolution which sends two very clear messages. The first is a unit message. This Parliament is capable of overcoming ideological and national differences in order to work in a common interest. That is why it is so important that the Recovery and Transformation Fund is within the financial framework, that is, subject to the scrutiny of this House; and that is why it is imperative that Parliament decides on an equal footing with the Council.  And the second message is that of ambition. Convergence and sustainability should be the objectives that set the course of the reconstruction plan and the resource on how to use that money. Society is asking us; young people are asking us to do so when they tell us not to sacrifice their future by renounging the European Green Pact and a more sustainable model of society; they're asking us on social media since the WeMoveEU initiative. Let us listen to those who from civil society want to work with us for a better Europe. Because Europe, ladies and gentlemen, is not ours. Europe is not our property and we therefore need more than ever of all energies today.  They also ask us not to abandon the weakest. That is why the other major axis must be the social pillar: a network that protects the most vulnerable and guarantees employment. We cannot give up important initiatives in this regard and we must also invest in a just digital transformation. To finance all these urgent policies, we call for at least two trillion euros to be endowed. I understand that this is a difficult time to ask member states for money and that is why it is time to raise the own resources ceiling to at least 2%. It's time to move forward with the issuance of reconstruction bonds. The plan should be based primarily on grants, and loans have to allow for long-term maturities and repayment linked to the economic recovery.  I have heard Mrs Van der Leyen talk about the European Semester, and I would like to remind you that our political group will not admit that the European Semester is not linked to issues as important as environmental sustainability, such as social rights and as sustainable development goals.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is very good to remember the past to draw lessons, but it is also important to look to the future. That is why I would like to address the European Commission and the Council: they currently have an important responsibility, and Parliament is prepared to support them, to work side by side, to shoulder their shoulders, but whenever you want to be ambitious and put the common interest before national discourses.

With the health crisis caused by the CoVID-19 pandemic, we are entering a major economic crisis. The experience of the last 70 years shows that Europe has advanced especially when it has had to find solutions to the crises that it has had to deal with. After this crisis it will not be enough to restore the economy, in many places it will take a profound transformation of the way we relate to resources, but also to technology. We will not be able to return to the economy of the 20th century, but, on the contrary, we will have to build the relaunch on a new foundation. Attention to the environment, digitalisation, strategic sectors such as health will be the core of the reconstruction and economic transformation we need.  We have a duty to propose a bailout for the millions of citizens who have lost and are losing their jobs, for the hundreds of thousands of companies in difficulty, for entrepreneurs, for our overloaded health systems, for crisis-hit sectors such as tourism, transport or agriculture. A truly European economic recovery and transformation plan, which must go beyond the traditional divisions east-west, north-south, net contributor or net beneficiary, Euro-non-euro and so on. The new European budget, as well as the recovery and transformation plan, must be the result of a democratic act, in which the European Parliament directly elected by citizens must play its part. The Union must not only share money, but also bring a common vision, and Parliament is the guarantee of the coherence of this vision. We must quickly return to a functioning economy that will, however, work on new parameters, in a European society that needs to reinvent itself after this crisis. This will only happen with investments whose benefits can be seen in the real economy, where people are running out of jobs, where companies are now going bankrupt without their fault. Our group will oppose any attempt to jeopardise adequate funding and the connection to the values of the next multiannual budget.  Firstly, we want a European budget that does not depend solely on the financing capacity of national budgets. If so, then the time has come to take on our own resources for the multiannual budget, which will give stability to the European budget without putting any more pressure on national budgets.  Secondly, democracy, individual rights and the rule of law are not negotiable for us. This is a red line for the Renew group when we adopt the multiannual budget. Europe will not be built with populism and extremism, but with real resources invested under the protection of values, the rule of law and functional justice. We'll recover together or we'll lose separately. This is the choice we have to make, the choice that I hope has only one answer. For me the answer is: together.  Let us have courage, on behalf of our citizens, who a year ago were going to vote in record numbers to be represented decently, dignifiedly and competently in the European Parliament. Now is the time to show that we have courage and that what we promised in the campaign, when we asked citizens to come to trust the European Union, we can put into practice, because once again and with that we conclude Europe is being built by solidarity in fact and not just by declarations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2020-05-13.json", "name": "Tom VANDENDRIESSCHE", "mepid": "185771", "text": "  on behalf of the ID Group.

Thirty years of globalisation has already turned China into the second world economy. There, the country has been hit by unfair competition, dumping practices, market manipulations and, above all, the naivety of Western politicians. The trade deficit with the European Union is already EUR 164 billion. In addition to being dependent, we risk being economically colonised and, in the long run, politically dominated by a communist dictatorship. That is why we need to rethink the relationship with China. We need to protect strategic sectors and infrastructure from hostile Chinese takeovers and infiltrations.

Colleagues, for the past three months, nurses, doctors, nursing assistants, cashiers, sweepers, garbage collectors, delivery men and, more recently, teachers have been putting their lives on the line to ensure the continuity of ours. For the past three months, European citizens have shown a huge outpouring of solidarity: help for isolated elderly people, food donations, mask-making and shared childcare. Initiatives are no longer counted. For the past three months, our citizens have been taking responsibility, but they are getting impatient - and rightly so; for in the meantime, what are European leaders doing? I have heard you, Mr Michel, and I welcome your statements in favour of a joint response and a reduction of differences within the European Union. But the reality is that when you look at the actions of the heads of state and government, when it comes to implementing this solidarity financially, they are relenting. They procrastinate. They lock themselves in the logic of each for himself. For more than a decade, some have been asking the question of solidarity in moralizing terms, as if the European Union were divided into two camps: the camp of the Member States deemed virtuous and, opposite, the camp of the Member States deemed sinners. Of course, the public management of the Greek, Italian or Spanish governments has not always been blameless. But it is successive Dutch governments that have been working to wage a real fiscal war against the rest of Europe. It was the German government that defended a car industry that was cheating all over the place. It is the Scandinavian banking supervisory authorities that have allowed the development of the largest money laundering networks of the last decade. At the same time, Greece, Italy and Spain took much more than their share of the reception of refugees, thus saving the honour of Europe. Undoubtedly, within the Union, all Member States have things to blame and all Member States contribute something to our common prosperity. So let's leave behind these moralizing arguments. What is at stake is the very raison d'être of the European Union, a project launched seventy years ago with solidarity as its cornerstone. This solidarity is motivated by our common interest: that of ensuring sustainable prosperity for our fellow citizens, that of regaining the capacity to face together the existential challenges of our time. Therefore, it is in our common interest to design, finance and execute together our economic redeployment strategy. And this, following a very simple principle: from each according to his abilities to each according to his needs. It is through a common loan that we will be able to finance this great project and it is through a common European tax justice that we will repay it. Parliament understands this: the restart and ecological transition of our economies requires a real Community surge. If we fail this test of fire, it will be the monetary union and, eventually, the European Union. European citizens have largely done their part. It's up to you, European leaders, to do yours!

Mr President, Presidents of the Council and the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, if we look back on the past few weeks, I do not think we can say that Europe has excelled through timely and coherent response to the pandemic. But we can make up for that in the coming weeks with the discussion on the multi-year financial framework and the recovery plan. With regard to this recovery plan, we will be voting in Parliament tomorrow on a text that contains clear indications of what is needed. That text will also be supported by my group. This will involve a lot of money. That's normal, too. The scale and severity of this crisis require a substantial budgetary footing. But it is often the focus on things that do not directly cost money but can still make a substantial contribution to the fight against the pandemic and certainly to the economic recovery. Commission President von der Leyen, among others, has already stressed the importance of the internal market. That importance cannot be stressed enough. The internal market plays a crucial role in restoring economic activity and employment. Second point, investment. Of course they are important. Private investment, but also public investment. I think it is high time we said goodbye to a very rigid Eurostat rule on the booking of public investment. It really inhibits the proper functioning of the economy. A third point that is gaining in importance every day is what I would call the need for geopolitical protection. We see international groups and investment funds raising billions on international capital markets every day. They do so, of course, to strengthen their liquidity, but it is clear that they are also making a war chest. I think we need to take pretty strong measures to prevent hostile takeovers. Temporary measures, but still.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The European Union is at a crossroads. Is it continuing its self-destructive course of austerity and austerity policies and failing as a project? Or will it become a real community of solidarity, 75 years after the end of the Second World War and 70 years after the Schuman Declaration? However, while the people of Europe suffering from the virus have been waiting for a clear political signal of unity and solidarity to be shown, the Member States, Mr Michel, have been arguing with each other for weeks. And during this time, those who in recent years have been the first to pay the price for cutting public services – with poor wages and miserable working conditions, with insufficient infrastructure – are keeping things going. And to these workers, Mr Weber, they deserve not only our thanks, to whom better working and living conditions are due.  As a result of the EU summit, the European Stability Mechanism is now lending EUR 240 billion – without conditions for the time being – to the Member States, but as loans. I wonder, Mrs von der Leyen, what happens if the debt rules take effect again? Are the Member States using the European Stability Mechanism heading for a new debt crisis? And what will the Commission do then? Will it then again recommend cutting health systems, cutting social security systems, cutting infrastructure, cutting pensions? Will public property be privatised again? And are those who are already bearing the greatest burden of the Corona crisis threatened with decades of austerity, because in your speech you explicitly referred to the European semester process? And that means nothing more than cuts and privatisation siting in public services, a halt to foreign investment in the infrastructure needed, and also a stop, the task facing the great European Union, which is to master the digital turnaround and the Green New Deal.  Instead, it is time now to put the Stability and Growth Pact on an end once and for all. We need a social investment offensive, and privatisation and the fall-out of public services must be reversed. We are faced with the great question – and we are all wondering – about how economic and social revival can succeed in the European Union. The Commission has been given the thankless task of somehow insinuating the squaring of the circle by the Council. At this point, however, it is not a geometric task, but a political one.  What is needed is a courageous EU budget, which is based both on the fact that the Member States have substantially higher contributions and, on the other, real own resources, that is, .B taken by a European digital tax, collected by a comprehensive financial transaction tax and, yes, also by – I repeat– a levy on wealth by the richest 1% of the European population. The rich and businesses must play their part in European reconstruction.  Instead, the building fund is now to be set – the amount and financing modalities, despite their speech, are still rather unclear. The funds will then go to the Member States as grants or as loans – as I did not fully understand in your speech.  If there is credit, it in turn increases the likelihood of a debt crisis in the future. Corona bonds, on the other hand, would have been the right first step to find a way to an ECB that directly supports eurozone public finances. There is a lack of courage on the part of everyone in this House.  The EU must decide which way it will go: continued austerity or solidarity.

Mr President, I would like to thank very briefly for the messages that have been delivered. Just a few points very quickly. First point: whatever extremist, populist, demagogic critics say when they speak out about Europe, the history of the European Union is a story that has revealed an added value unprecedented in human history, in terms of prosperity, rights and freedoms. We must not stop recalling this European achievement, whatever the demagoguery and populism.  Second element. We have all said it, each and every one with our words, our sensibilities, our approaches: we are confronted - we feel it well - again at a key moment. It is the responsibility of a generation to be up to the task. And indeed, Mr Weber, I share your view: this is not the time to compete with legitimacy. The European institutions are democratic: the European Parliament, which directly represents European citizens, and the Member States represented by governments which, every week, face political responsibility before their National Assembly. This legitimacy must also be respected, it seems to me, and of course the Commission must be a driving force, a political driving force to fuel the dynamics of this European debate. In any case, be convinced that, for my part, I will do everything possible with colleagues in the European Council to ensure that not only do we not wage a sterile battle institutionally, but that we are mobilised, with our sleeves rolled up, hands in the mud, on these subjects that are now on the table: what is the amount needed for the MFF and for the Recovery Fund , how to finance it, how to distribute the loans, the subsidies to ensure that there is this capacity to forge a political compromise useful for The Citizens of Europe, how are we going to succeed in the digital agenda, how are we going to succeed in this climate agenda? Because these problems before did not disappear after. On the contrary, they must be levers of hope, of hope, because Europe has demonstrated that we have the talents, the intelligence, the resource. Our main resource is European citizens.

I think that it will be irreversible for the Member States to put significantly more money into the pot here, because the challenges are simply much greater. It is a pity that Mr Michel had to leave early. That is why the minimum 2% of the own resources ceiling is important. I believe that even in this day and age, it is crucial that we use the right tools to meet the objectives you have described, even with the right mechanisms. You mentioned digitization – absolutely right. We need new mobility. We need investment where it makes sense, in artificial intelligence.  And I believe that, and I would like to thank the European Commission again today, the path you have taken today with your guidelines to gradually open borders and strengthen tourism in a special way will help us to get a run-up.

Coming out of this crisis requires us to mobilise large amounts of public investment. Sadly, our Member States coming out of a large euro crisis are too burdened with debt to undertake this investment. That’s why the solution is that Europe rises to the challenge and Europe puts together this plan, this Schuman plan, if you allow me to call it this way. This Parliament proposes that the European Commission raises a two trillion recovery package that is financed by recovery bonds, which allows us to invest in medical, in Green Deal, in digitalisation, in all the priorities of our European citizens. Now, the big question is: how do we finance such a plan? Five groups in this parliament are offering a grand bargain to our Member States. We are offering them a deal. We are saying: ‘we understand you’re really constrained, we understand it’s hard for you to raise your contributions’. That’s why we think these interests and this principle from these long—term loans that we need to pay for the plan have to be paid with new own resources that make those who cheat on their taxes, the digital companies that are not contributing as much as they should, the big polluters, pay what they should be paying. This plan, Madam President of the Commission, is economically sound because we need this investment, is politically feasible, as you will see tomorrow when you count the votes. It’s feasible to be ambitious, it’s feasible to have an ambitious plan, and it’s financially possible because our citizens are looking for good investment vehicles into the future. There is demand for such an investment vehicle. Seventy years ago, Mr Robert Schuman said ‘we need to make Europe in the concrete’.

Furthermore, unlike other foreign central banks, the ECB cannot directly finance the European budget, nor are there any other forms of own resources that do not result in additional taxes for European citizens. The next MFF, the instrument on which European solidarity should be based, will therefore only allow one round game for someone and a net loss of resources for others. Countries with very large spending margins are already financing their own economies, denying any possibility of mutualisation of sovereign debts or Eurobonds. The instruments put in place, including the recovery fund, will therefore only be able to lend by forcing countries with already high debt to borrow even more and by burdening the blameless citizens with this crisis, the only lenders of last resort, given that the Treaties prohibit European central banks from playing this role.

The next MED plays a key role in boosting our economies after the crisis and is therefore necessary to be ambitious and of sufficient size. However, given the seriousness of the crisis, a recovery fund envisaged by the Commission is also necessary, but it should not come at the expense of traditional EU policies, which have already proved their usefulness on a number of occasions. Cohesion policy and agricultural policy should therefore also be strengthened. Cohesion policy is the EU's most important investment instrument, of which all States and Member States are winners. Let us preserve the recently introduced flexibility in the use of cohesion funds, at least in the first years of the new MFF. As a Hungarian Member, I will pay particular attention to the fair distribution of funds. Hungary has performed outstandingly in economic catch-up in recent years, with growth of around 5 percent.

On the other hand, those who buy shares on the financial markets pay 0.0%. Zero point zero. Because they are poorer than the poorest? No, of course not. There is an urgent need to create a financial transaction tax. Already in 2011, the Barroso Commission had proposed this project, which can now create 57 billion euros. The text is written, there is only to move forward politically. Despite Brexit, despite the crisis, a financial transaction tax can bring in 57 billion euros. So what are we waiting for?

This pandemic knows no borders; neither should the EU’s response. That is why the chairs of the committees in this Parliament who deal with external policies have issued a joint statement. We have called for close cooperation with our neighbours and partners, both in the fight against the pandemic as an imminent health issue and against its serious future consequences.  In the past few weeks, we have seen remarkable efforts of cooperation and acts of goodwill, but we have also had to witness increased isolationism, harsh competition between nations for medicines and equipment, intense propaganda and disinformation by third countries, and a sharp rise in cyber—attacks. This shows this pandemic has a global meaning. It’s a global challenge.  The Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will be the main instrument to tackle this challenge we face within the European Union, but also to support our partners not only, but foremost, in our immediate neighbourhood. This has to be covered in the future MFF.

There was a lot of passion. There was a lot of ambition in your statements. What I think I saw most across all the interventions today is that there is a clear push for making sure that the EU, our Union, our Europe, will emerge from this crisis stronger, more modern, more sustainable and more resilient. I think these have been the calls presented by the leaders – Ms García Pérez, Mr Cioloş and Mr Lamberts. I cannot tell you how much we in the Commission appreciate the close cooperation with this House, especially over the last few weeks, where your quick decision—making helped us to be able to deliver to our citizens what was needed the most. We all had to focus on how to save as many lives as possible at the beginning, then on how to preserve as many jobs as possible, and now we are discussing together how we are going to relaunch the European economy and how we are going to recover from this dramatic crisis.  I would really like to thank you for that because, with that cooperation, we have already been able to deliver, over the last few weeks, more than 200 measures, some of the very important legislative proposals adopted by you, which really went in the direction of how to help people on the ground concretely to overcome this unprecedented crisis. Thanks to the heroic efforts of our health professionals and thanks to the discipline of our citizens, we are finally seeing that the terrible numbers of corona crisis victims are slowly going down. We all know that this was a very difficult period, but the biggest test is still ahead of us: how to recover from this crisis, how to relaunch and restart our economy, and how to get back to normal. This could indeed be, as Mr Weber described, the Schuman moment of our generation. Therefore, I very much appreciate this debate because, as Mr Silva Pereira said, we need to be ambitious and bold to meet this challenge, this test, of European solidarity and credibility. How do we want to achieve that? Just let me quickly recap some of the major features of the proposals we are currently working on. We want to base our response on a powerful future long—term budget, a multiannual framework with a strong recovery instrument which would dramatically boost the financial firepower of the EU. I would definitely call this an unprecedented ambition. So here I would beg to differ with Mr Verhofstadt that this is ‘business as usual’. I was personally involved in the negotiations on the last three financial perspectives and what we are proposing right now has never been done before. It’s very bold and very ambitious. I believe that, with your support, we can deliver on this challenge which is ahead of all of us. I would like to reassure you that we want to reinforce all the policies which work and which are, I would say, battle—tested. We would like to make sure that we will top up the cohesion funds and focus the top—up especially on those who have suffered the most during the crisis. We want to use and improve the work of InvestEU and of Horizon, which is so important for supporting our scientists. And we would never forget the very important social aspect of our work for the European Union. We need to tackle poverty, we need to make sure that the Just Transition Fund works efficiently, and of course we cannot forget about women, parents and all the issues related to gender balance, which will be so important for our recovery. On top of that, we are bringing to the table a new solvency instrument to prevent bankruptcies caused by this crisis, and we also want to develop a new health programme that would prepare us better for the future. So, once again, I repeat, this is definitely not ‘business as usual’. This is a very ambitious response to the current crisis. I would like also to respond to the calls of Mr Lamberts, Mr Eickhout and Mr Ertug by saying we definitely want to use this new financial firepower to bounce our economy forward. We want to make it greener and more sustainable. I think that this crisis has taught us the lesson that we have to be more resilient through strategic autonomy and technological sovereignty. These are the areas where we need to be much more active than before, and this is our goal. To all those colleagues who have been highlighting the importance of own resources, I would like to reassure you that we are very actively working with all options. Most of these have already been mentioned here in this debate. We are going to present proposals which we believe will be acceptable to all and which could be approved by your votes and by the Member States. It’s very clear that, if we have to deliver on this challenge, we can deliver only with your full involvement and with clear oversight and scrutiny from the European Parliament.  If you allow me, Mr President, before concluding, I will make just two quick remarks on issues which are not related to the main theme, but have been raised in this House. As they are so important, I just want briefly to react to them, these being the questions from Mr Olivier and Mr Omarjee concerning the German Constitutional Court’s recent ruling. Here I would like to say that, despite the fact that we are studying the ruling of the German Constitutional Court in great detail, I think our President has made it very clear. She clearly said that, when it comes to the primacy in Europe of EU law and the independence of the European Central Bank, these are basic principles which we are ready to safeguard and defend if necessary, even using the option of infringement proceedings. So we are clearly working on it.  To Ms Yoncheva, I would like to reassure her that we are working on the report on the rule of law, where we will study all the known issues, but also on how our governments have been using special powers during this difficult period and how to make sure that we will, as quickly as possible, bounce back to normally—functioning democratic systems. All this will be brought to your attention and to your table at the latest in September. Once again, Mr President, thank you very much to everyone for this debate, for the ideas, for the encouragement and for the ambition I have felt in this House.

Let me also thank you for this very useful debate. We will convey your views to my colleagues and to the President of the European Council and his team. We face extraordinary circumstances, but the situation only strengthens our resolve to work harder for the benefit of our citizens and our economies. As President Michel told you, our shared objective is to build at EU level a long-term response to the dramatic consequences of the COVID-19 crisis. This will complement the rapid and wide EU support already deployed with your help these last weeks. Today, the President of the Commission gave us an outline of the modified MFF and an ambitious recovery instrument. We are yet to receive details of the Commission’s proposal, and you will understand, therefore, that I am not in a position to comment on the substance today. The proposals will have to be analysed in the appropriate fora, and guidance from the European Council will be needed for the Council to form its position on the text. Our next MFF should be the cornerstone of the recovery of the European economy, of the rebuilding and the re-establishment of the functioning of the single market in the post-COVID period to ensure the massive public and private investments needed. It should have greater investment potential, especially in the initial years of the new financial perspective. The post-crisis European Union economy should become resilient and more self-sufficient, and for the recovery to be swift and successful, cohesion, convergence as well as solidarity will be of utmost importance. Continuous cooperation between our institutions will be an essential part of all of this process. The Presidency is firmly committed to maintaining the existing good working relations that we have established in our response to the crisis. We will therefore continue to be attentive to Parliament’s views on these very important files.  In this spirit, I have taken good note of the legislative initiative report and of the resolution you are preparing. These are useful reminders of where the European Parliament stands in the context of crisis. Good interinstitutional cooperation will also be essential for our sectorial work. We will need to work together to ensure a timely adoption of sectorial programmes and we will look forward to working with you on them.
