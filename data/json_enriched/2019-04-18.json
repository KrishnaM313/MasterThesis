We can be proud of the progress we have achieved together since then. We are recognised today as one of the global leaders in dealing with these substances.  Since 1999, we have banned or restricted many endocrine disruptors. Furthermore, we have been the first to establish regulatory criteria to identify endocrine disruptors in the legislation on pesticides and biocides. We have also provided funding for research and have supported international organisations. However, this is not enough. Today, endocrine disruption is still a global challenge and a source of concern for many citizens. We cannot rest on our laurels and we need to step up our approach.  This is why, last November, the Commission adopted its comprehensive communication on endocrine disruptors. Adoption by the Commission confirms that we remain committed to protecting EU citizens and the environment. It also delivers on the commitment undertaken when working on the criteria for pesticides and biocides. The EU approach to endocrine disruptors needs to remain based on science and on the application of the precautionary principle. We have three objectives in mind. First, minimising overall exposure to endocrine disruptors. Second, accelerating the development of science; and third, promoting an active dialogue with all stakeholders.  The Commission has identified a comprehensive set of actions with different timelines to achieve these objectives. These are outlined in our communication and I am pleased to inform you that work has started on all of them.  The cross-cutting fitness check on endocrine disruptors should be finalised in the first half of 2020, with a 12-week public consultation planned for this year. In 2019, we also aim to organise the first meeting of our annual stakeholder forum and to launch a new web portal. Other actions announced in our communication have a long time frame, for example in the area of supporting research. Honourable Members, I know that some of you are disappointed by the idea of the fitness check. I can assure you that we are not simply trying to kick the can down the road. We are all committed to evidence-based policy-making and evaluations and the fitness check helps us make better policies. Today we have different approaches to tackle endocrine disruptors in different sectors. The Commission agrees that there should be coherence in the treatment of these substances. However, before proposing changes to the legislation we need to see whether and what changes are necessary. Different treatment of the same substance does not mean incoherent treatment per se.  We have already undertaken some useful evaluations, but none of these has covered all of the relevant issues. Furthermore, we need to look at some issues in a cross-cutting way, such as the criteria to identify endocrine disruptors and the different regulatory consequences. The fitness check will fill this gap and will pay special attention to those pieces of legislation that regulate products used in the daily life of consumers, including the most valuable ones. I’m thinking, for example, of the legislation on toys, cosmetics and food contact materials. Evidently the fitness check will not start from scratch, but will build on data already collected in the previous evaluation. We want to finish this quickly so that the new Commission will have the information at hand to make an informed decision. Before concluding, I would like to say a few words about the significant work that the Commission services carry out on a daily basis to implement existing policies that are relevant for endocrine disruptors. These are in many cases particularly important to protect vulnerable consumers. Just to give two examples: the Commission is finalising a priority list of potential endocrine disruptors used in cosmetics for swift assessment and possible follow-up regulatory action; and second, in the area of food contact materials, we are waiting for further scientific advice in Bisphenol A (BPA) and fatalities, and we are ready to act as soon as this is finalised.  I am confident that by advancing coherently in all relevant policy areas, we will achieve the objective that we all share. I’m looking forward to hearing from you on this topic, and thank you very much for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-04-18.json", "name": "Julie GIRLING", "mepid": "96956", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I’m actually speaking today on behalf of Mr Gieseke, who is not able to be with us. But I would like, on behalf of the PPE Group, to broadly support the motion that Parliament is putting forward. We are in line with the objective of formulating a comprehensive EU framework on endocrine disruptors. The motion highlights a number of areas where work is required and I guess if this was a school report, it would have some phrases such as ‘must work a little bit harder’. We certainly need the pace of investigation and validation of data to be speeded up and, whilst I appreciate the Commissioner’s points about the fitness check and I wholeheartedly support them, we are concerned about speed and we are concerned about making sure that we don’t let this particular issue slip. There needs to be investment in the whole issue of substances (we have highlighted that in Parliament’s text), substances used in mixtures and their joint and several effects. There is broad consensus on that. It’s been customary this week for Members to use their last speech in this Chamber and we’ve heard an awful lot of ‘this will be my last speech’. Well, I’d like to just go to that theme for a moment because for me, as a British MEP, I want to just mention one thing about Brexit and how it relates to this subject because Brexit has taught me a lot. It’s taught me never to pursue with blinkers on anything that’s ideological. Be very careful with decisions based on emotion, on gut feel, on belief. Be very careful about creating acts of faith, as opposed to action based on evidence. It can lead to disproportionate and damaging action that later causes regret and difficulties finding a way back. What’s that got to do with endocrine disruptors? Well, I think rather a lot because we do hear quite a lot of what I would call ideological hysteria about endocrine disruptors. I’m thinking here about Amendment 1, which is a good example. We will not be supporting it in the PPE. It calls for the same actions for suspected endocrine disruptors as for proven endocrine disruptors. This goes too far, it goes too quickly and it’s not based on scientific evidence. Secondly, on Brexit, we were told not to listen to experts. Well, on endocrine disruptors we must. We must look carefully at the scientific criteria and evaluate in a calm and systematic way. Broadly, we can support this statement.

These chemicals are present in many products and materials around us, including plastic bottles, children’s toys, cosmetics and food packaging. Europe must do everything possible to phase out dangerous substances, particularly those with endocrine disrupting properties. But in order to do so, we need the political will and we need concrete action. We feel that the European Commission did too little too late, because we have the strategic framework. However, there is still a lack of concrete action to provide full protection for human health and the environment. We are saying this because, even with the strategy, we are still excluding, for example, toys and cosmetics, and this only leads to a fragmented patchwork of different national standards, which makes it difficult for everyone, both for consumers, who do not know what level of protection they can expect, and also for producers, who suffer from diverging standards. We need a European course of action, and it needs to put people’s health and the environment first. We expect the European Commission to expand the scope to address endocrine-disrupting chemicals also in materials and products such as toys, cosmetics and food packaging. As socialists and democrats, we are pushing for a legal framework that can help protect our citizens. We are also asking for a horizontal definition of E disease that is aligned with the WHO’s definition. We believe that people have the right to know that their everyday environment and the products they use are not harmful to their health, and on behalf of the Socialists and Democrats I call on the European Commission to acknowledge the European Parliament’s resolution and our legitimate concerns, as it is time to phase out endocrine disruptors once and for all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-04-18.json", "name": "Frédérique RIES", "mepid": "4253", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, I have been in this hemicycle since 1999 and, in 20 years, we cannot say that the European framework on endocrine disruptors has evolved, while science has advanced. Researchers have revealed the impact of these disruptors on human and animal health, as well as their link with certain chronic diseases, in particular certain cancers, with infertility and with certain neurodevelopmental disorders. This link is true. The European Union does not seem to have taken the measure of what the WHO already described as a global threat in 2013. We are very late. In 2015, the Court of Justice condemned the European Commission for its lack of action on the matter. Four years later, not much progress has been made, Commissioner, and this new strategy looks like a failed act. For example, the definition of endocrine disruptors only applies to plant protection products. However, we now know that 80% of exposure is through food. They must therefore be prohibited in cans, in trays, in all these materials which are intended to come into contact with food, in cosmetics, too, as has been said, or even in toys. I checked yesterday: only eight substances are listed as endocrine disruptors in the European database. There are over 1,000! A study published a few days ago indicated that traces of 90 disruptors had been found in a single river in France! This is the big gap: we need to speed up the identification tests. Bisphenol A, the one whose harmful effects are the most documented, remains widely authorized. Europe is not moving fast enough. Result: Belgium, but not only, France, Austria, Denmark, Sweden have already started to move forward on their side and to legislate.

By its long-term inaction, the Commission is endangering the health of entire generations of its citizens at serious health risks. Since 1999, when the Commission came up with the first strategy on endocrine disruptors, we have just wasted time, Commissioner, not that we have done a great deal of work. We have not been able to take any appropriate measures to minimize the exposure of these substances to the general public. The Commission has done nothing in this case for the last five years, despite being blamed in court. Endocrine disruptors are everywhere, in food and water, in their packaging, in our cosmetics, in medicines and even in the toys we give our children. There is no scientific doubt about the many harmful effects that these substances have. We gave the manufacturers long enough to come up with a solution themselves. Of course, they didn't come up with anything. On the contrary, we have found out how much they like to manipulate facts and scientific studies. Conflicts of interest between scientists clearly need to be resolved more intensively than we have done so far. Endocrine disruptors must be strictly regulated, as must carcinogenic and mutagenic substances or substances that are toxic to reproduction. This means that we need regulation in all sectors where they are currently present. We need to make sure that we gradually phase them out as soon as possible. To do this, we need to determine the mandatory requirements for their testing and identification. We must realize that, as with mutagenic or carcinogenic substances, there is no safe exposure threshold for endocrine disruptors. The limits we have now, for example for bisphenol A, are simply set too high. Studies have shown adverse effects of bisphenol A exposure well below these limits. Colleagues, it would be a matter of course to ask you to support our resolution. I would also like to inform you that we have tabled a number of improving amendments to the resolution, which we believe will better reflect the frustration we have at this time with the Commission's inaction.

Thousands of scientific publications tell us that endocrine disruptors are involved in many chronic diseases: certain hormone-dependent cancers, obesity, diabetes, loss of intelligence quotient in children - because pregnant women ingest endocrine disruptors and that it can have an impact on the metabolism of children - infertility, etc. And you, the Commission, what are you doing? You save time. Frankly, you told us you had a strategy in 1999, but in the last 20 years, what have you been doing? Who made you evolve? It was the European Parliament that made you evolve! It took a Swedish minister and Parliament to go to the European Court of Justice to say to the Commission: 'Do your job!' You were outside the European treaties to define, precisely, what an endocrine disruptor is. As a parliamentarian, I say to myself: luckily we parliamentarians are here to protect the health of European citizens. What do you propose? Let us use the precautionary principle, let us minimize the exposure of people. The reports by Ms. Demeneix, CNRS, and Mr. Slama, Inserm, show us that there is an increase in exposure of pregnant women and the general population, but you have no specific action plan. This resolution that we are proposing to you, it says to you: “Let's go!”. At the legislative level, there is not even a common, horizontal definition of endocrine disruptors present in cosmetics, toys, additives, food containers. They are only available for biocides and pesticides. And then there is REACH. It's still amazing! As for the assessment tests, they do not even cover all applications for authorization of substances. Who are we laughing at? I really ask you, for the next legislature, to have an action plan, to take up the proposals of parliamentarians to eliminate these endocrine disruptors, just like carcinogens, mutagens and reprotoxics.

They are found in frying pans, furniture and cosmetics. No matter how hard a person tries, he alone would not be able to protect himself from chemicals. That requires legislation. None of the endocrine disrupting chemicals are directly dangerous. However, we know about the negative effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals - we have known about them for a long time. We know how these chemicals affect our hormonal activity. The results of the study show the effect of hormonal disorders on the deterioration of sperm quality. Other known consequences include hormone-related cancers, early breast development, and type 2 diabetes. Endocrine disruptors are characterized by their specific effect on the developing body. Fetuses, children and adolescents are at greatest risk of exposure. The effects of contaminants are irreversible and can affect generations.

I think this has been a very positive file for all of us, there has been very good cooperation on this file, the Maritime Single Window, which aims to facilitate the shipping industry, to facilitate the movement of goods through European ports, to ensure that when a ship comes to a European port that there will be a harmonised set of data with which it will have to comply or provide. Currently the situation is fractured and it is not easy. A ship coming to any individual European port, even in individual countries, may and does find today that they have a different set of requirements, additional requirements at some ports, so the idea is to facilitate trade, make it more efficient and harmonise the set of data that is required. It’s a simple path now, I would say. We’ve had cooperation from seaports, an opportunity to visit them – I certainly have myself – and to engage with them and to see what they have on the ground and some ports are at a very advanced stage and others are not so. But the idea is to bring every European port to the same level through a single Maritime Single Window. As I said, we have had very good cooperation, in the trilogues as well, and I would just thank the Commissioner for her time at that and also the Romanian Presidency. It went very smoothly. One of the first meetings that I had in Parliament here, coincidentally, was with representatives from the shipping industry and, as I said, they outlined the burden and the challenges that they all face. So, for me it’s particularly pleasing to be able to deliver now something that is to their benefit and the wider trade facilitation.  We’ve just seen this week the start, hopefully, of trade negotiations with the US; with Canada has been signed in this term of this Parliament, and other trade deals as well – the Japanese trade deal – they all mean business for our ports and business for the shipping industry and ultimately for European business and European consumers. This has been real and positive for the shipping companies and for the ports, so it’s a win—win for everybody. As I say, we are streamlining the systems and creating a Maritime Single Window with over two million port calls in the European Union every year. Some ports are still using paper and 1970s technology and this changes that. It will reduce the burden, first for the short—shipping, particularly, as well and improve its competitiveness which is very important. The harmonising reporting process will increase efficiency and it’s expected to reduce the administrative burden by up to 720 million by the year 2030 by cutting the reporting time in half, and that can only be a good thing. There have been a number of particular issues that we have addressed and number one is to recognise that what’s existing at the ports already can be built upon. If, in some cases, there were additional data requirements and exceptional circumstances, that can be accommodated, but only for a limited period of time. Technology neutrality was part of our debate as well and we’re happy that that has been referred to on the base of the Window. And also a governance dimension, that was very important I think, and maybe my fellow shadow rapporteurs will speak on that as well, but the governance dimension was very important for us and for shipping companies as well, so that we knew if these changes were implemented who was responsible and how could it be tracked. The agreement has, as I say, been very positive and I very much look forward to the next phase of this implementation and to seeing the results in terms of the reduction in bureaucracy, time spent by shipping companies, and ultimately facilitating the smooth movement of trade into and out of European ports.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 12, "date": "2019-04-18.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission is very happy that the legislators have reached a political agreement on this regulation establishing a European Maritime Single Window environment. We will finally now be able to respond to the long-standing request of the EU maritime industry for a fully-harmonised environment for ship reporting in all European ports. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Clune, as well as the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) shadow rapporteurs – it’s great to see you all here today – for their work and determined efforts that allowed an agreement to be reached in a smooth and quick way. Today, shipping operators spend around one to three hours per port calling for reporting. The new rules will cut the reporting time by 60%, saving about 2.5 million hours every year, and will hence reduce administrative costs by up to EUR 725 million for the shipping sector by 2030. This will be made possible by the adoption of a common set of data definitions and standards; the integration of the existing national maritime single windows in a common interoperable horizontal environment; and the third: the provision of a harmonised interface for such reporting. The new environment will also facilitate sharing and reuse of data and implementation of the ‘reporting once’ principle. When fully implemented, the environment will ensure that a ship reports in the same way, no matter to which port in the EU she will be calling at. In addition, the entire logistics network will benefit from a more efficient flow of information. The shipping sector considers this regulation one of the most relevant initiatives in terms of the improvement of operational efficiency and reduction of administrative burdens, and it has already expressed great satisfaction with the compromise text. I believe that the compromise text not only satisfies all the requests of the three institutions and of the maritime sector but will also benefit the entire logistics network by promoting digitalisation and a more efficient flow of information, which, of course, has a direct impact on competitiveness and the possibility for the maritime sector to be fully integrated in multi-modal solutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 13, "date": "2019-04-18.json", "name": "Wim van de CAMP", "mepid": "96754", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Thank you very much. A very good morning, everyone. My thanks also to Deirdre as rapporteur for this rather complicated file. Digitization in the transport sector continues unabated. Hopefully this will lead to a more efficient and cleaner transport system. With the maritime one-stop-shop system, as it is so nicely called, we talk about many different aspects that come together when registering ships in the port. After all, it is not only about the port papers. It also concerns the customs documents. It concerns the hazardous substances. And so there are many elements that are united in this. It is fair to say that the 2010 guideline has failed somewhat. That is why this Commission has issued a new directive, which will hopefully create more uniformity and clarity. Personally, I continue to be concerned about the cooperation between the different systems, in particular the so-called port communication systems. How will that work in practice?

I would like to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, colleagues and the Commission for the good cooperation on this dossier. The main aim of this regulation was to reduce administrative burdens. We have certainly achieved this goal. The regulation means less bureaucracy for shipowners, for ship crews, for pilots, for port authorities. The standardized reporting formalities for ships will significantly simplify the exchange of information between shipowners and port authorities and between the port authorities themselves. We have also ensured that there is good training for the port employees who will be involved in this new system - and we know that well-trained employees are essential for a well-functioning port. However, we have not only achieved improvements in the European seaport environment with this regulation. In the last five years there have been a few things that we have put on the path. I am thinking, of course, of the ports package, which has now had to be applied in the Member States for a few weeks. With this regulation, we have prevented forced liberalization, created financial transparency and strengthened workers' rights. I believe that only recently, with the directive on the discharge of waste, we made a significant contribution to improving the environment in ports.

In fact, things are coming full circle for me today, not just because this will be my last speech as a Member - I will not run again - but when I came to the Committee on Transport and Tourism in 2009 - I can still be precise remember - at that time Dirk Sterckx, our Belgian colleague, was working on the previous law, namely the voluntary digital port freight paper regulation. And there it really was that they said: There should be a national maritime single window and it doesn't have to be applied everywhere. In the meantime we have noticed that it did not work well, neither in Germany nor anywhere else. Today we have made significant progress and now we really have the digital handling of port papers - at least on paper. And then it will be implemented, and I think that is very important, an improvement for fast handling in ports and a good thing for everyone involved. And Knut, now you've partially stolen my speech from me; I just wanted to point out that we have achieved a lot of things, especially for the ports, in this legislative period: It started with your report, with the Port Package, where I was also allowed to work - that was a nice cooperation - and then it happened recently my ship's garbage disposal, which we decided, and now, Deirdre, your report from today. I think we have really achieved a great deal for the ports in this parliamentary term. I would also like to thank everyone again because this is my last speech. I take a little time to do this.

A single declaration interface for ships will significantly reduce these administrative burdens, helping to further facilitate trade, digitization and modernize maritime mobility.

They are fully in line with our cooperation that led us to this point.

The environment will profit, our organisation will profit, we will increase efficiency, and of course shipping will become even more competitive.  Just one additional clarification regarding the port community systems that Mr van de Camp raised: the Commission will not rule out other possible reporting channels, provided that the interfaces for the Single Maritime Window are available and operators are offered the choice. This will be a choice for the Member States. On the other hand, port community systems will be able to use data services and provide additional value added services in ports for maritime operators, of course if they comply with the technical specifications set out in the application of this regulation.  Finally, let me thank Ms Clune one more time for the excellent coordination, all the shadow rapporteurs and all colleagues for really constructive and focused work, which of course delivered this very important piece of legislation.

I would like to invite you to continue in this spirit, no matter where we engage, and make sure that we create a resilient, sustainable and very cooperative Europe based on democratic values.

We have to step up to the big challenge of our time and come into action. We have to do it step by step, stone by stone, and this report, this regulation is an important building block to make the financial sector work, not just for profits but for people and planet, to make finance part of the solution of sustainability challenges and not part of the problem. From the start, the idea has been radically simple: make sustainability part of the DNA of the financial sector. Let considerations of sustainability apply as broadly as possible to all financial products, to all financial institutions, for all sorts of impacts, and as always with radical ideas, it sounds simple but the implementation is not. But I still dare to say that the negotiation results still broadly reflects this idea. Indeed, sustainable finance should not be stuck in the green corner, as a manifestation of goodwill while, at the same time, as an excuse for the bulk of non-sustainable investment. In fact, not in a green corner, but sustainability should be discussed in the boardrooms of banks, insurers, pension funds and asset managers. This means that sustainability considerations should be integrated in every step of the decision-making – in every step. This means everyone in the financial sector has to move. So yes, this is what we need. We need a broad scope, an unlevel playing field, so that consumers who want to know what their product is, can learn to know that, and even more important, we need a broad scope so as not to punish the front runners and to benefit the slackers. We need a broad definition of sustainability. This is a broad concept encompassing a wide array of considerations, ranging from biodiversity to human rights, from emissions to working conditions, and we need a broad framework to manage risks and impact – not only the identification of impacts but also actions to prevent and mitigate them; not just disclosure but also due diligence. I think this report makes progress on all three fronts, and that is a big win. This resonates already with the mind-shift we see in part of the financial sector. A broad range of FSAs is already applying due diligence and, just this week, many of them subscribed to a call for mandatory due diligence. This enables them to show their social value but also to achieve a higher-risk adjusted return. Economics and values can go hand in hand. I would like to call on the European Commission and the supervisor to use the openings in this regulation to work on standards for disclosures, to better define the social impacts of investments, to work on standards for due diligence: these are what we need to truly make the transition towards sustainable finance. The message from the regulation on disclosure and on the critical benchmarks should be clear to the financial sector: finance will become sustainable. Don’t wait for it but start working on it.

This disclosure regulation is a key element of the Commission Action Plan on sustainable finance and it is an important capital markets union initiative to achieve climate neutrality by 2015.  It is also a very important step towards the overall objective that you just mentioned of connecting finance with the needs of a more sustainable economy. Our consultations showed that there is not enough transparency on how financial market participants integrate in their policies the negative impact of climate change and its related risks on the value of the investments, for example in assets located in flood—prone areas.  This can lead to distortions in the investment decision process and savings allocation. In Europe, we’re facing a yearly investment gap of EUR 180 billion to reach our climate and energy goals. This goes up to EUR 270 billion if we include water and resource management. The Commission has proposed to devote a quarter of the EU’s budget to climate-related action as of 2021, but public spending is not enough. The private sector has a key role to play in reorienting capital flows towards sustainable investments and reversing the negative effects of climate change.  The negotiations broadly kept the Commission’s approach and added disclosure obligations on adverse sustainability impacts. The reason is that investment decisions and financial advice might contribute to negative material effects on environment and society, regardless of whether the investment strategy pursues a sustainable objective or not. For example, investments in assets that pollute water or devastate biodiversity. We support this extension, which represents an important improvement of the proposal as it would achieve more transparency and better information to end users on all types of financial products concerning sustainability aspects.  This agreement will increase the level and quality of information available on sustainability issues. It will also promote market discipline, discouraging greenwashing. We believe that it will bring behavioural changes in the financial markets to support the transition to a more sustainable economy.  How? First, financial entities will be incentivised to better manage sustainability risks. Second, better information on the sustainability of financial products and in financial advice will encourage a shift in retail investors’ behaviour. Finally, the disclosure on the negative externalities on environment and society will gradually contribute to price in these externalities. The Commission thanks the co-legislators for having taken up discussions quickly and for having achieved an agreement, and I want to congratulate in particular the rapporteur, Mr Tang, for steering this debate towards a very successful conclusion. This is not the last step as the Commission is working with the co-legislators on the remaining part of the May package proposal on climate taxonomy and on the implementation of the other actions part of the Sustainable Financial Action Plan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 35, "date": "2019-04-18.json", "name": "Sirpa PIETIKÄINEN", "mepid": "40599", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, the financial markets are multi—fold compared to the real economy, so it really matters where those financial flows are directed.

But it is good news that we can guide that investment towards those challenges where we very well know what we have in investing for sustainability on combating climate change. We have more than enough money. The question and the crux of it is the information. That’s why I regard this regulation about these clauses as the mother of all sustainable finance regulations. It is the question how you disclose not only environmentally-friendly actions but the whole impact of your activities in the environment.

The Parliament’s report was far superior to what’s been forced upon us now by Member States who are determined to avoid taking any action at all against climate change, it seems. Disclosure isn’t a big risk; it’s the bare minimum we can demand from the finance sector that is doing so much to damage our economy and our environment. So let me repeat once again: the scientific consensus is that we have until 2030 to act to make rapid and far-reaching transitions in all areas of our economies if we’re to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees. That’s just 11 years away.

I deeply regret that the Council did not match Parliament’s level of ambition and continued to insist that some of the sustainability risks and impacts of investments can be concealed from citizens. The inclusion of a regrettable comply and explain exemption means that companies can continue to choose to hide dirty and destructive investments, thus undermining the power of the sustainable finance agenda.

First of all, I would like to thank my Social Democrat colleague Paul Tang very much for the really good job he has done as rapporteur and for his tireless commitment to sustainable finance. We are taking an important step today, namely that all players in the financial market must in future transparently disclose information on sustainability at product and company level. It has just been mentioned that the day before yesterday Greta Thunberg was here in the European Parliament, in the Environment Committee, and she made it clear that we must finally act if we want to avoid an environmental or climate disaster. Then it is not enough if Mr Weber, who is not there now, takes some nice photos for social media and at the same time prevents the young woman from appearing here in the plenary. Even without Greta - we don't have a problem of knowledge, we have a problem with implementation! The conservatives say: \"Sustainability, yes, but please not against the resistance of industry and the financial industry\". When it comes down to it, it becomes clear that it is often about greenwashing and that it is supported, and that sustainability is not pursued as a real political goal - not ecological sustainability, not social sustainability. We saw it recently here in Parliament: There were important amendments to the Taxonomy dossier rejected by us, the Social Democrats, and the other side, the Conservatives - motions that would have made definitions of what is actually sustainable, and above all that which is not sustainable. So what is to be done? Firstly, to the new Parliament, to the colleagues who will soon be responsible here, and to the next Commission: things must go on. Today is an important step, but that is not enough. It must go on for a sustainable economy. This includes that banks must also take risk measures, namely in the form of higher equity, and that it is disclosed if investments have negative effects. This is important.

The Commission proposal was geared towards the establishment of transparency obligations for actors and for assets that were part of the green financial sector: it was a first step against greenwashing, but it risked reinforcing the trend of sustainable finance to be locked into niches where fund managers would invest marginally to give themselves a greener image without fundamentally changing their funding method. On the contrary, we are asking the entire financial sector to publish information on the environmental impact of its investments, and particularly the large companies, which have the most significant impact.

In fact, financial market participants and financial advisors will have an obligation to integrate environmental, social and governance risks and opportunities into their respective processes as part of their duty to act in the best interests of clients. The new rules, together with the carbon neutrality agenda and the EU agenda for sustainable development, link finance to the needs of the real economy, helping to achieve the 2012 UN Sustainable Development Goals and the goals set by the Paris Agreement.

Federica Mogherini is right: it’s not the last step, far from it. This also to Matt Carthy: yes, we need to work on this further. But I hope that these first steps, as Ms Sirpa Pietikäinen said, are a clear signal to the financial sector that change is coming: we are changing towards sustainable finance. This is a credible step towards that, and further steps will follow. That’s why I also now call on the Commission and the supervisors to keep on working on this file. I’m happy to work in the next Parliament and, if not, outside this Parliament on this change that we need. Having been in this debate, I also learned that there’s a change underway in the European economy. We need to break away from the Anglo-Saxon—American tradition of ‘move fast and break things’, in which companies and financial institutions are just actors in an economy driven by monetary incentives. We need to return to the European tradition where we take into account companies, financial institutions and the board takes into account the interests of all stakeholders. We need to return to the European tradition where firms, companies, financial institutions, banks and insurers are part of our society and act accordingly. This is the change that we need, and I think it’s underway, because I can already see this change coming. I see front—runners. Maybe it’s because I’m a politician and I’m always an optimist, but I see good signs for this change. I think it’s very welcome to have this change to bring forward a fairer and more equal society.

Trust in the democratic participation of people in social development requires transparency. The processes and conditions in the camps in Xinjiang must be investigated - precisely out of respect for the wording of important articles of the Chinese constitution, conditions in camps must also be prevented. In a constitutional state, no administrative or police authority may arbitrarily detain people for long periods of time or on the basis of fabricated or very low suspicions.

But what we regret today is the huge step backwards in terms of the freedoms and opportunities that people have there. We know that since the last party congress the party has determined everything, wants to determine everything in all situations, and so the opportunities for people and groups within the Chinese population have become very limited. Above all, religious freedom is under enormous pressure, even though it is in the Chinese constitution.

I would say a more intense one, but also a more frank and open one, based on clear words, clear principles and also clear interests that we are not shying away from affirming in the clearest possible manner – trying to build some consistency in the approach the European Union and all its institutions are taking towards China. Let me here make an appeal to each of you. You are representing here European citizens, but you’re also representing political groups and national parties in political groups. Many of you that have taken the floor today, saying very reasonable and very important words – most, probably, of you also belong to parties that have government responsibilities in your own Member States. So I would like to hear those voices, those clear words also, in your addresses to your own governments whenever they meet their Chinese counterparts, to be straightforward as the European institutions are – as, I have to say, during the last summit last week in Brussels, we have been, both the Commission, the Council, myself – to the top leaders of the Chinese authorities on human rights and passing the clear message that to Europeans, human rights are not less important than economic interests. On the contrary, they are as important, if not more important, than our economic interests. I think this is a message that we have to, consistently and in a coherent manner as Europeans, pass at all levels. The Parliament (and I thank you for that), the Commission, the Council and single Member States individually taken in their relations bilaterally with China. China has made some progress in the field of economic and social rights, but the general human rights situation, as you have mentioned, continues to deteriorate, particularly on civilian and political rights. Human rights defenders and lawyers continue to be arrested and detained; fundamental freedoms continue to be violated. We’ve all seen the reports on the situation in Xinjiang, with political re-education camps targeting Uyghurs and other minorities; mass surveillance; restrictions on travel. And, as I said, we raise these issues, including some individual cases, with the Chinese authorities, both in our bilateral contacts and in our human rights dialogues. We also (here I should move to the other side of the Hemicycle – you will forgive me if I stay at this place), for the first time ever, invited to the Foreign Affairs Council the Foreign Minister, State Counsellor of China, Mr Yang Jiechi, and I was proud to see that, united, the Member States passed messages consistently at the level of foreign ministers on issues of relevance to our human rights dialogue. But we also raise these issues in the context, in the framework of our counter-terrorism policies, and I stress how important it is for us to be consistent and coherent across the institutions of the European Union on these messages, because there might be the tendency in our interlocutors – not only when it comes to China, but also with others, when we talk about human rights – of thinking that it’s the European Union institutions that raise human rights issues, and then Member States or individual Members of Parliament do business. I think it is very important that we are consistent in the messages we pass, and I think that we are making, possibly, some progress in this consistency and this unity, so that our Chinese interlocutors see that this is important for every single European, every single European Member State, every single political family of this Hemicycle. I’m taking here the opportunity again, publicly, to urge China to allow meaningful access to Xinjiang for independent observers. Some of you have mentioned that. Let me add my voice once again on the call for independent observers, including for the UN and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Likewise, freedom of religion, of belief, is often violated in Tibet, and restrictions to access to the region are also in place. We have called on the Chinese authorities to allow reciprocal access to Tibet for European journalists, diplomats and families. We raise all these concerns at every occasion, as I said, at the highest level, including at our summit last week. Publicly and privately, this was clearly underlined. We discussed the situation in Xinjiang, in Tibet, freedom of religion or belief and the rights of persons belonging to minorities. Also, during our latest human rights dialogue, just a few weeks ago, we raised the issue of the shrinking space for civil society also in the framework of the legal reform, and we addressed the autonomy of Hong Kong. This exercise is often not an easy one – it is sometimes frustrating, and yet I believe this is the best tool we have to engage with our Chinese partners, to be clear, to be united in the messages we pass, and to promote a change of course on human rights. Our best tool is to keep engaging with China human rights in a respectful but extremely clear manner. No other global power is doing this in the world today. The global trend on human rights is not encouraging at all. We’ve discussed this in this Hemicycle, many times. I believe this is exactly one more reason for us not to give up. We cannot afford, as Europeans, I think, to stop engaging. We will continue to advocate for the respect of human rights, be it in China, in a very clear manner, but also all around the word. I’m looking forward to the next discussions on these issues.

The excessive use of force against demonstrators, the incarceration of political opponents, shutting down the Internet and attacks on journalists can never and in no way be justified as a means of reacting to the purely important threats to which Cameroon is subject.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 84, "date": "2019-04-18.json", "name": "Dominique BILDE", "mepid": "124771", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - Mr. President, first of all, this is a strong tribute that we should pay to the armed forces, as well as to Cameroonian civilians engaged in a merciless fight against Boko Haram. Especially since this resolute fight against terrorism, Cameroon will have carried it well beyond its own borders, within the framework of the Trans-Saharan partnership, then within the multinational joint force. And it is despite a very difficult internal situation that it has long hosted thousands of Nigerian refugees fleeing Islamist barbarism. These are the facts of arms of Cameroon, light years away from the vitriolic portrait that some believe it is appropriate to paint. This country, a guarantee of stability in a region torn by multiple tensions, does not lend itself to outrageous simplifications. First of all, because the dissensions between Anglophones and Francophones are less the result of deep antagonisms than of well-understood economic interests. It is off the English-speaking regions that the main national hydrocarbon reserves lie, and the management of the public companies that control them is an acknowledged issue. Then, because considerable reforms have been agreed to by the Cameroonian government, I am of course thinking of the commission for bilingualism and multiculturalism, the wider openness, Anglo-Saxon law within the Supreme Court as well as the National National School of Administration and Magistracy or, finally, the recruitment of bilingual teachers. Moreover, plural Cameroonian society cannot be defined by this single cleavage. How many anglophones now live in francophone territories and vice versa. ?

Paul Biya undoubtedly went too far in the process of centralization, thus fueling the resentment of the English-speaking populations of the West and the Muslim separatism of the North.

But the government has not limited itself to this has also begun to hunt down journalists and independent media, spreading a climate of terror throughout the country. In addition to the harsh political repression, there are also bloody clashes in the regions of the north-west and south-west, between the army and armed separatist groups, reminiscent of a postcolonial period that perhaps never really ended. The losers, as always, are civilians, especially students, given that the target of this violence are often schools and hospitals, destroyed in protest against the government. I therefore call on the Cameroonian government to release all political prisoners immediately and to organize an inclusive political dialogue as soon as possible for a peaceful and lasting solution to the crisis in the English-speaking regions.

Key opposition figures are under arrest – they face military trials. More than 100 protesters or sympathisers are facing prolonged detentions, and defence lawyers claim that Cameroon’s own legal procedures are not being respected. A de facto ban has been imposed on marches and protests of the opposition, which is clearly not in line with the constitutional rights of Cameroonian citizens. We have been following the situation closely, constantly, on behalf of all the 28 Member States. We’ve asked for the release of detainees against whom hard evidence cannot be produced, and we have asked for an immediate halt to violence, to human rights violations and hate speech, and I insist on this message today. Thank you for putting this important debate on the agenda on the last day of your mandate, to stress this message in a unified manner. Regarding the situation in the English-speaking regions of the north-west and south-west, we have consistently called for dialogue as the only way to achieve a sustainable solution, in a non-violent and inclusive manner, respecting fundamental rights and the rule of law. Regrettably, unlawful killings and atrocities continue to be reported regularly, allegedly involving both the security and defence forces and separatist groups. The humanitarian consequences of this situation are alarming, with about half a million internally-displaced people and over 32 000 refugees from Cameroon registered in Nigeria. We have raised our call for restraint and dialogue directly with the authorities of Cameroon. In particular we are following closely the cases of the 47 Anglophone leaders that are in jail, insisting on the need for a fair and transparent trial. These tensions add to the continuing attacks that some of you mentioned by Boko Haram in the far north, as well as in Chad, Niger and Nigeria. We know that Boko Haram is not invincible and has suffered major setbacks, yet we are seeing civilian deaths and also losses by the security forces in Cameroon. Given that new refugees from Nigeria have recently arrived in the far north region of Cameroon, I wish to join the recent appeals from the UNHCR that the universal principle of non-refoulement has to be respected fully. These are the reasons why we need to continue our humanitarian support as part of the international humanitarian response on the different and various fronts.

This stands in stark contrast to international legal norms. In addition, equality must apply before the law, regardless of gender, sexual identity, origin and religion. A de facto death penalty moratorium has existed in Brunei since 1957. This moratorium should be continued as a step towards the abolition of the death penalty. And only if Brunei revises Sharia criminal law in line with international law, should the European Union even consider continuing negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement at all.

These measures form part of a reform process started in 2014 that brings the Sultan’s criminal code fully in line with Sharia law. These reforms also allow for the amputation of limbs as a punishment for those convicted of stealing. These reforms are of particular concern to religious minorities, and the LGBTI community in Brunei will find themselves particularly at risk. Clearly, there is no place for such a harsh penal system in the modern world and it fails to respect Brunei’s international human rights commitments.

Certain punishments of this code amount to torture and acts of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. As Brunei, I’m sure, is fully aware, these punishments are prohibited by the United Nations Convention against Torture. The Sharia penal code effectively reintroduces the death penalty and will make homosexuality punishable by death by stoning. This is an abominable and savage practice, which must be resisted.  I’m proud to come from a country like Ireland, where in 2015 we were the first country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage by popular vote. While religious freedom and religious tolerance are extremely important facets of the world in which we live, it is important to move forward and not backwards, and ensure that basic human rights are respected. I urge the Brunei authorities to repeal the Sharia penal code and ensure that its laws comply with international law and standards, respect the fundamental rights of all citizens and insist on the decriminalisation of homosexuality, and I hope all other countries around the world will send a strong message to Brunei as well.

The court foresees, as you mentioned, punishments such as amputation, public flogging and death by stoning, which simply have no place in the world. Also, there is a clear expansion in scope for the potential application of the death penalty, and you know our principled, clear, strong position against that penalty everywhere in the world. We believe there is no justification for these kinds of punishments – no crime justifies an amputation or torture, let alone the death penalty and, for sure, no person should be punished for loving someone. That can never be interpreted as a crime. These punishments – if applied – would constitute a violation of many of the international commitments undertaken by Brunei Darussalam. These acts are prohibited by the Convention against Torture and other cruel, inhumane and degrading treatment or punishment, which was signed by the country in 2015. They also go against the 2012 ASEAN Human Rights Declaration and they may also breach the country’s obligations as a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. On the very day of the announcement, we reacted together with many of our international partners, starting with the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet. We expect now the Government of Brunei Darussalam to make sure that the implementation of the Penal Court Order will not infringe human rights and will be fully consistent with all international human rights obligations undertaken by the country. I think this debate is a very important opportunity to stress the expectations we have. We also expect the country to maintain its de facto moratorium on the use of the death penalty. Let me add that we have been following this issue for years. It is not just a few weeks ago that we started to react. When the 2013 Penal Code was adopted, we suspended negotiations on a partnership and cooperation agreement with Brunei, and since then we have raised the issue in all our meetings with the country’s authorities and in our annual reports on human rights and democracy in the country.  It is now essential to prevent the application of such punishments. To this goal, we will first and foremost continue to put pressure bilaterally on the authorities of Brunei, both directly and through the Member States that are present in the country, and obviously the new EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Eamon Gilmore, will work on this. We will also continue to engage at the UN Human Rights Council, in particular within the ongoing universal periodic review, where Brunei will be reviewed, and we will raise the issue with our ASEAN partners, since this also represents a violation of a commitment taken by Brunei in the ASEAN framework. I will also have the possibility to raise this matter personally at our next annual European Union-ASEAN meeting next August.  The ban on degrading punishments is not simply about European values. I want to underline this point that many of you have raised: these are universal values cherished by people of all backgrounds and of all faiths all around the world. These are rights that are not at the disposal of any authority or any country. They belong to all people and no State can take them away. This is about the dignity of each and every human being, and we, the European Union, will continue to work for this dignity to be respected everywhere in the world, starting from Europe. As this is the last debate of your mandate, I will maybe say a few words later, but let me thank each and every one of you for, in particular, the work we’ve done on human rights. I’ve appreciated this enormously. It has been incredibly helpful for the work of European Union diplomacy around the world, and I can only share the views of those that mentioned the fact that we hope that in the next mandate, there will be a growing number of Members of Parliament that will engage on the promotion and the defence of human rights inside the European Union and around the world.
