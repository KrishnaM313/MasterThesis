I will go directly to the three of them. First, from the European Union response to the coronavirus crisis, it’s clear that the global pandemic needs global solutions, and the European Union must be at the centre of the response. To do so, in April we launched a Team Europe response to support our partner countries facing the pandemic. I have already presented this in your committee meetings. On 8 June, we discussed at the Foreign Affairs Council on Development how to move forward quickly and we mobilised EUR 35 billion to help the most vulnerable countries in Africa, Latin America and our neighbourhood. One could say that it is not fresh money but just redirecting already—allocated resources, but anyway, it was very important to give priority to the pandemic. The extension of the key European Union programmes for refugees is also crucial during this crisis, and we appreciate Parliament’s efforts to approve the necessary Draft Amending Budget in July to allocate more than EUR 400 million in support of Syrian refugees. In the new MMF proposal, we have included a top-up for external action policies, financed through the Next Generation European Union instrument. Part of this funding will go to humanitarian aid, and part to the provision of a higher ceiling for the External Action Guarantee under the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI).  We have also provided for an additional provisioning of EUR 10.5 billion, and with that, we could provide guarantees up to EUR 130 billion under European Fund for Sustainable Development Plus (EFSD+) operations, as well as additional macro-financial assistance and loans to third countries. This will allow us to help to boost sustainable and green investment in our partner countries worldwide. I hope I can count on your support so that we can maintain an ambitious level of resources for our EU external action. Let me say that it is badly needed – because this crisis will be a crisis of biblical consequences. Look at the situation, for example, in Latin America, where things are becoming worse. Happily, in Africa, things are not as bad as expected. But, in general, both health and economic consequences of this crisis will be very important and, I am afraid, long lasting.  The second issue in our debate today is about the People’s Republic of China and the national security law for Hong Kong. Let me frame my answer on a very evident fact. COVID has accelerated existing trends, with tensions between China and the US growing by the day, and I want to repeat what I have already said and written many times: that Europe needs to find its own way when it comes to balancing its relations towards both actors. Yesterday, the French Minister of Foreign Relations was saying more or less the same thing in the French press and I think it’s quite a shared point of view at the Foreign Affairs Council. But independence does not mean equidistance. The transatlantic partnership remains the most important and strategic relationship for the European Union. We maintain divergences with the current administration in the US, that’s clear, evident, with regard to their stand on multilateralism about the International Criminal Court, for example, the last one. Nevertheless, we seek positive engagement wherever possible.  Our relationship with China does not fit into a single category. I am sorry for the people who would like to have simple schemes. This is not possible. This is complex, and complex it will remain, and it needs to be based on trust, transparency and reciprocity. China is clearly a necessary partner, like it or not, to solve global challenges such as the global pandemic and climate change. No one can imagine that we can solve climate change without a strong commitment from China’s side. At the same time, human rights remain a contentious issue in our relations. I raised these concerns on the situation in Hong Kong with the Chinese Foreign Minister last week. We had a long conversation: more than three hours face to face. I think it was a useful and frank conversation about all issues of a complex relationship and, for sure, the adoption of a security law for Hong Kong is not in conformity with China’s international commitments, particularly under the Sino-British Joint Declaration enshrined in the Basic Law of Hong Kong. Pressure on Hong Kong’s autonomy and fundamental freedoms affect us directly. It’s not just a matter for the Hong Kong people. It’s a matter of values, principles and the need to uphold international commitments, seriously undermining the ‘one country, two systems’ principle and Hong Kong’s autonomy. As you may be aware, I made this point very clear in my declaration on behalf of the EU27 on 22 and 29 May. On that issue, there was unanimity, something that is less and less frequent in the debates at the Foreign Affairs Council. I also raised these matters in the United Nations Security Council when I had the opportunity to address this body, on the very day this decision was adopted. I am at your disposal during the question and answers to discuss the specific measures taken by the EU and to go deeper into this issue.  On the third point, on the possible Israeli annexation in the West Bank: let me turn now to this issue, the possible annexation by Israel of parts of the occupied Palestinian territory. There, our position is clear, although, once again, it’s difficult to find unanimity. But there is very much a strong majority of countries that continue supporting a negotiated two-state solution based on international parameters and considering that any annexation would be against international law. Consequently, we strongly urge Israel to refrain from any unilateral decisions that would lead to this annexation of any part of occupied Palestinian territory. I had the opportunity of expressing this point of view in my phone calls to the new Ministers of Foreign Affairs and of Defence of Israel. This would constitute a serious violation of international law. In March, in Geneva, 27 Member States agreed on that. At the last Foreign Affairs Council, unhappily, unanimity was not found on this same issue, but as I said, very much a strong majority of countries continue to support this principle.  Second, this would cause real damage to the prospects for a two-state solution. Third, it would negatively affect regional stability, our relations with Israel, and between Israel and Arab states, and potentially the security of Israel, which is something not negotiable for us. Let me stress that also. And finally, from a European Union perspective, annexation would inevitably have significant consequences for the close relationship we currently enjoy with Israel.  My time is reaching the end. I will stick to my time. I will not prejudge today the specific impact of a possible annexation, but let me underline that the European Union has its own obligations and responsibilities under international and European law, and as agreed in the mid-May Foreign Affairs Council, we engage with our Israeli partners to avoid such a step before it’s too late. We are using all our diplomatic capacities in order to put pressure for that not to happen. As I said, I opened a constructive conversation with Alternate Prime Minister Gantz and Foreign Minister Ashkenazi, where I expressed in the same terms as I explained to you the gravity of such an announcement. I have also been in close contact with the Palestinian leadership and other key Arab representatives. Several EU Foreign Ministers passed the same messages on, and we held an important discussion with the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo earlier this week. This issue took an important part of the one-and-a-half-hour discussion with Mike Pompeo. In the coming weeks and months, we will continue engaging with the parties and the international community in support of a negotiated two-state solution based on the international parameters and which ensures equal rights for all.  Thank you very much, Mr President, for giving me half a minute more. Thank you for your attention. I need to stop here. I think my time is over, but I will remain at your disposal for the many issues I am sure you will raise during our dialogue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  Thank you very much, Mr Vice-President, for the statements on very important topics, all of them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "David McALLISTER", "mepid": "124806", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, as I am convinced that we should stand up for fostering the European Union strategic autonomy for promoting multilateral solutions and for defending our interests in a spirit of solidarity, I welcome today’s debate on the foreign policy consequences of the COVID—19 pandemic.  We all know that this pandemic will not only lead to more medical, social and economic changes of a tremendous dimension, but it will also, as the High Representative and Vice—President, Josep Borrell, has pointed out, also be a potential geopolitical game changer. To name just a few examples, we are witnessing the deterioration of democracy and fundamental freedoms in many parts of the world, increasing disinformation campaigns, as well as cyber—attacks and isolationism instead of multilateral cooperation. As the European Parliament, we should make clear that unprecedented global threats arising from the pandemic call for strong and coordinated measures.  I welcome that, in the months and weeks to come, all the committees for external policies in our Parliament want to focus even more on our global response. With today’s debate, but also with upcoming hearings as well as the reports the respective committees are working on, hopefully we can highlight the importance of the foreign policy dimension for the fight against a global pandemic and we can send a strong signal of solidarity with our partners across the world.

Europe was to become a global player. The Coronavirus is putting this ambition to the test. In the last few months, the virus has forced our world to become smaller, keeping us locked down in our houses. And yet, this virus has become a global challenge reaching all corners of the world. It has shown us how connected and interdependent we have become.  However, it seems it is idealistic to think we can globally unite to face this crisis. It is disheartening to see examples where countries have attempted to use COVID-19 to divide Europe and even to act against our interests through so-called Corona diplomacy, disinformation campaigns, and with the escalation of tensions in, for example, Libya and at the Chinese-Indian border. We have to realise that the world keeps turning fast.  It is vital Europe starts acting in a more assertive way to face the challenges ahead with a clear and unified voice in the global arena. This is the moment for the Commission to live up to its geopolitical ambition, leading the search for answers on finding the origins of the virus, leading the global community in the search for a vaccine that will need to be made available to all people and countries, and leading the way to protect European interests, together with our liberal democratic allies in the world.  In the absence of global leadership by the United States, the European Union has to fill this void. Therefore, I call on everyone here present to embrace this global opportunity and responsibility.

But it’s also characterised by two novel features.  It’s the first international crisis, since decades, in which the United States withdraws from any possible international leadership role, while China has been at the centre of this crisis, more than ever before, and this is not for the better.  This situation reflects the ongoing continental drift in international relations. On the one hand, we have a hegemonic battle between two superpowers, on the other, international institutions are being weakened - in particular multilateral institutions - and undermined. Through the impact of the crisis, these tendencies are being accelerated. For our EU this constitutes an imperative to step up to the plate and to shoulder our own international obligations more confidently.  We have a mixed record. We failed when we imposed import-export bans for PPEs. We did well when the Commission organised a donors’ conference for financing vaccine research and we will lead a coalition at the WHO to require an inquiry into the origin and the spread of the pandemic. But the challenges are many and they are huge. Battling for our values and our interests means finding allies and showing our opponents that we mean business.

If regimes use corona funds to buy weapons for their police to enforce lockdowns, it doesn’t stop the virus. It only spreads fear and death.

It needs to be clearly linked to the health emergency and above all, people have to be allowed to debate them and often they are not.

The second point I would like to underline is the exaggerated European dependence on the outside world. We must achieve a high level of health autonomy. We cannot continue to depend on third countries in strategic areas such as obtaining sanitary material or active pharmaceutical ingredients for the manufacture of medicines. Currently, suffice it to note that 80% of the world's production of these pharmaceutical ingredients is concentrated in India and China. On the other hand, it is clear that we must help third countries, especially our African neighbours, in their fight against the crisis and, therefore, I welcome the that the Union's response has made an important financial contribution to the fight against the pandemic in third countries. And I'm done. Unfortunately, pandemic outbreaks have occurred over the past two decades. Incomprehensibly, the latter of COVID—19 has caught us by surprise, again.

I say this because I place my hopes in the wisdom of Israeli democracy. I say this, as my country did when it saw the United States go wrong in 2003 by launching a war in Iraq for the wrong reasons, a war that has had so many negative consequences. The role of a friend is not to be silent, it is to alert the one who risks being misled. All of us here in Europe know that we only make peace with our enemies.

Of course, it is impossible not to wonder what the European Union is doing. As we have said many times, his communiqués and statements are impeccable, but time gives us reason. His words don't do much good if you don't move on to the facts. Mr Borrell, some questions I would like you to answer are: What does the European Union expect to recognise the Palestinian State? Why is the Association Agreement not already cancelled, applying the second Article? Why is Israel not prevented from participating in all EU-funded programmes? Why is an arms embargo not imposed on the Israeli regime? Why is trade in products from illegal settlements not prohibited? Mr Borrell, we must take steps to replace the law of the strongest with the law of protection of the weakest.

Colleagues in the EPP are wondering what we are doing here today. While the EPP seems to be waiting for an annexation and then be reactive, we in S&amp;D prefer to be active and prevent a possible annexation. If Israel were to proceed with the annexation plans, it would be a major blow to the peace process. The chances of resuming negotiations on the two-state solution would be completely impossible. It would also undermine the situation and strengthen the breeding ground for polarisation, extremism and violence in the region.  An annexation constitutes a violation of international law, as well as a violation of Article 2 of the EU-Israel Association Agreement. But even if the major annexation plans under Trump's plan do not happen, there is actually a step-by-step annexation in the form of expansion of the settler areas of Palestine. My question to you, Mr Vice-President and High Representative, is: what steps do you intend to take towards Netanyahu's annexation plans to show that we are a Union that stands up for fundamental rights in the region, in our Union as well as globally?", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 39, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "n/a", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. \"Five minutes is enough time to answer 33 speakers. You will understand that my answer cannot be as complete as I would have wished. I am delighted to be involved in this debate, and perhaps it would be good if I could also have the opportunity to interact with you in my answers, I will try to do so as much as possible. Different views have been expressed on Israel, the annexation. Someone has said that it is debatable, whether or not it is in accordance with international law. I can only tell you that there are twenty-five countries of the twenty-seven that believe it is contrary to international law. They'll all be wrong, but that's what they think. Twenty-five countries of twenty-seven have clearly supported a statement that this would be contrary to international law. Why are we talking about this now? Because we're trying to keep it from happening. That we don't know the plans of the Government of Israel? You forgive me. Yes, we do. Of course we do. They are public and notorious, they are part of the coalition agreement. And I myself have been explained live and live ministers of that government. And the German minister, who has gone to Israel, has been told directly. I mean, let's know, we know. Let's not do ostrich politics. No, we don't know. Yes, we know. And what are we doing? We are doing our best to ensure that diplomatically these things do not happen and we do not have to deal with a difficult situation. Why does the European Union not recognize the Palestinian state? Because the European Union does not recognise anyone, it has no capacity to recognise. This is done by the Member States, and each makes the decision it deems appropriate. What measures are to be taken? Well, we'll see. Let's not anticipate. Here, yes; let's not anticipate. Let's try to foresee. But certainly, the majority position, which is not unanimous — unfortunately, I cannot assure you that it is unanimous, because it is not — is that this would be contrary to international law and that it would have to have consequences, and we are trying to prevent it from happening. As for Hong Kong and China, I cannot agree more with you on the need to do everything in our power to ensure that China's international agreements and the system it agreed with the United Kingdom when China left the colony are respected. We do this by defending principles, but also because it is in our interest, and there is intense activity about it. There are more issues in our relationship with China, which we will discuss at the next summit. I've tried to refer to all of them, and so do you, but let us focus on one very important aspect that many of you have pointed out, which is that the crisis has brought with it —I think it was Mr B'tikofer and others who have rightly pointed it out—a crisis of American leadership—the United States has clearly withdrawn from any attempt to lead the global response to the pandemic—a hegemonic battle between the two great powers and a weakness of multinational instances. This is the scenario we're on. And I sincerely believe that Europe cannot fail to ignore this scenario and that it has to have a position of its own. As for strategic autonomy — it has a lot to do with what many of you have also pointed out about our over-reliance on the supply of medicines, and we now realize that our dependence is much greater than we thought and can become critical at critical moments like this—we need to strengthen this strategic autonomy and maintain our values and interests autonomously—and I've strived to explain that it doesn't mean equidistant, but to be very clear about what we want, what we stand for. Because, whether we like it or not, unfortunately, we cannot always agree with the United States, because the United States makes unilateral decisions that we do not share. And since we don't share them, we can't be on their side. For example, we cannot be on your side in the decisions you make regarding the International Criminal Court. And here, I hope That Parliament will agree with this statement. And instead, we have to preserve transatlantic unity in what is always possible, because we share the same political system. That's why we sometimes say that we are China's systemic rivals because we certainly don't share the same political system, but that doesn't mean we have to be rivaling China at all times. Because there are very important issues on which we need joint action, to the extent that it can be agreed. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that these are the answers. Yes, arms race. No, no one is thinking that let us push for an arms race, but unfortunately there are conflicts that we have to deal with, and unfortunately these conflicts must be confronted with weapons. The next time a group of terrorists storms a village in Mali and kills all its inhabitants at the machine gun point, we will send them the text of a Resolution to invite them not to continue to do so, but I think it is much more efficient than the forces of those countries and ours — which are deployed there to fight terrorism — have the means to do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 40, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  I inform you that I have received six motions for resolutions submitted in accordance with Article 132(2) of the Rules of Procedure.

Our citizens have been flooded by often false or inaccurate information, which not only creates confusion but is also putting health and lives at risk.  To address these risks the Council has strongly emphasised the need to intensify joint efforts in the fight against disinformation through close cooperation between EU institutions, Member States and social platforms. There is consensus in the Council about the need for more effective methods to address disinformation without hindering the protection of fundamental rights. Indeed, our strong and coordinated action against disinformation must be in line with our democratic values, including freedom of expression and free and plural media.  All institutions, Member States and civil society are called to act against the plague of the infodemic. Much has been done in the EU institutions, in cooperation with Member States. The External Action Service’s StratCom Task Force and the rapid alert system, which was set up in the run-up to the European elections last year, track disinformation. We support and welcome these efforts.  A comprehensive approach at all levels is needed to address the challenges of disinformation. This must include monitoring and analysis of disinformation and manipulative interfaces, enforcement of European data protection rules, efforts to enhance pluralistic media, professional journalism and media literacy, as well as awareness among citizens.  EU institutions and Member States should continue working with social media platforms to achieve higher standards of responsibility, transparency and accountability on addressing disinformation. The whole society approach is also stressed by the recent Joint Communication ‘Tackling COVID—19 disinformation – Getting the facts right’, which takes stock of the measures taken in response to disinformation around the coronavirus pandemic and proposes further action.  The Presidency takes COVID-19 disinformation very seriously and we have taken steps to ensure close cooperation with Member State authorities, with EU institutions, bodies and agencies, and with international organisations such as the WHO. As early as 28 January, we activated the European Union’s integrated political crisis response arrangements regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing together relevant experts from the Member States and the EU institutions in the fields of health, consular affairs and civil protection. In this framework, disinformation has been one of the topics we addressed. We believe that disinformation campaigns could also be highly disruptive in the respect of easing restrictive measures and of searching for a vaccine and a cure. We have also addressed the issue in other parliaments, such as in our Horizontal Working Party on Enhancing Resilience and Countering Hybrid Threats, in the Political and Security Committee and in the EU–US Justice and Home Affairs ministerial videoconference.  We are conscious that disinformation is here to stay and we all need to work together to maintain our vigilance, strengthen our toolbox and resilience, and continue our efforts to address this issue internally and beyond our EU borders. COVID—related disinformation is aggravating existing divisions in the eastern and southern neighbourhood and in the Western Balkans. At the Zaghreb EU—Western Balkans summit on 6 May, the leaders of the EU and Western Balkans partners agreed to reinforce their cooperation in addressing disinformation and other hybrid activities. As I said at the beginning, when fighting disinformation we must not forget the balance between the right of citizens to be properly informed and safeguarding the freedom of speech and the media. In the wake of the COVID—19 pandemic, unprecedented circumstances led many Member States to adopt far—reaching measures which were key to acting rapidly and effectively protecting the health of the citizens.  Many of these measures had a significant impact on fundamental rights, democracy and the rule of law. It is therefore essential to make sure that they remain proportionate to the objective, limited in time and subject to regular scrutiny. The emergency measures taken to tackle the pandemic must not be used as a pretext to censor news and informal information coverage or to violate fundamental rights. It is critical that governments support the work of the independent media, which are crucial allies in the fight against COVID—19. The democratic debate, media freedom and the role of civil society deserves special attention. Upholding these values is a priority for the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 50, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Josep BORRELL FONTELLES", "mepid": "28267", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, it’s really evident that the virus pandemic has been accompanied by an ‘infodemic’, a pandemic of information. We have witnessed a wave of false and misleading information, and an exponential increase in targeted influence operations by foreign actors.  We have seen again that this information can do real damage. In the case of a pandemic, which affects the health of the people, it’s even more dangerous. We have seen disinformation saying that drinking bleach can cure the coronavirus. I’m not making any specific reference to anyone, but this has been said – drink bleach and you will be safe – or that washing hands doesn’t help. It can also spark crime. Take, for example, the vandalism against 5G infrastructure in some Member States, mainly in the Netherlands.  In March 2020, European leaders called on the Commission and the High Representative, through the External Action Service, to take action. Last week, we followed up with a joint communication on disinformation related to the pandemic. Together with my colleague and friend, the Vice—President in charge of Values, I will also comment on this communication. This communication summarises what the European Union has done to tackle disinformation in the crisis and how to step up action. Disinformation knows no borders. Democracies and the West as such have been the target of disinformation, which underlines the importance of international cooperation. Let me turn first to the external dimension. The infodemic has clearly been exploited by foreign state and non-state actors. Disinformation from Russian actors has spread conspiracy theories and orchestrated disinformation campaigns, targeting the EU and its Member States and neighbours by alleging a lack of solidarity and an internal crisis within the European Union, and sowing confusion. China has also participated in that. Russian sources are old news, but China has been more active. China’s sources have been promoting this image, presenting theirs as the better system, the best equipped to tackle the pandemic, and blaming democracy for its handling of the virus. One can imagine that doing self—praising propaganda is something that everybody does, but I think there are limits. It is one thing to explain that you believe yourself to be the best and another to deflect blame on the handling of the virus by others.  At the same time, there is a clear risk of governments using the infodemic as an excuse to limit fundamental rights and freedom of expression. Some Members referred to that in the previous debate. I think that the European Union needs to take a stand against this. What has been done to address these worrying trends? We have been working to promote strategic communication and public diplomacy in our neighbourhood, especially in the Western Balkans. The External Action Service has stepped up its efforts to address foreign influence operations, publishing regular reports, analysing the trends in disinformation and sharing findings with Member States, our international partners, civil society and the media. The people working at the External Action Service are doing extraordinary and difficult work in this field.  We have made good use of the instruments we have at hand to tackle disinformation overall in the current crisis. We have mobilised the Rapid Alert System, which connects all relevant EU institutions and all EU Member States. This has been proving to be a valuable network. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, a dedicated space has been set up to exchange information on disinformation related to the virus. We have further increased our cooperation with our international partners – NATO and the G7 and its Rapid Response Mechanism – and we are also happy to be working with valuable partners such as the United Nations and the World Health Organisation.  Looking ahead, we will step up our actions by enhancing concrete preparation on strategic communication and public diplomacy, increasing the sharing of best practice in fighting disinformation, and activating more quickly the Rapid Alert System, intensifying the joint work with relevant partners from civil society and the private sector, stepping up the monitoring of violations of press freedom and supporting advocacy for a safer media environment. On this, we now have a specific programme, under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace, to support regional governments in tackling the crisis and to debunk disinformation that can further fuel tensions in conflict areas.  I could go into more detail, but I think it’s now time to leave it to the Vice—President for Values and Transparency, Ms Věra Jourová, to continue on the important work with social media platforms and other aspects of this joint communication.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 51, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, we have just heard from Josep Borrell about the basic parameters and the information on what we call the ‘infodemic’ that is going on in parallel with the pandemic we are going through. This is why we decided to prepare the communication and adopt the communication, which has the title ‘Getting the Facts Right’. It was necessary because we needed to inform about what have been the steps taken up to now against disinformation because, in the COVID—19 context we didn’t start from scratch fighting against disinformation. We already had the Code of Practice and we had the Action Plan, and its second purpose was to come up with a to—do list for all involved, especially the platforms, to step up their work. In the communication we comprehensively address three things: the sources of disinformation, its channels and amplifiers, and also the targets. Josep talked about the foreign sources of disinformation and I am glad about this because I believe that a geopolitical EU can only materialise if we are assertive, but we also have to put our own house in order. We need to beef up our strategy on communication. We have to get our story out about Europe and EU support during the coronavirus crisis, and it is high time we step up on this and do not allow others to occupy that space. Now to the channels of communication and disinformation – especially the online platforms. I welcome the measures taken by them in this crisis; their strong commitment is heavily needed. I believe that the fact that we worked with the platforms, and we designed with them the code of practice on disinformation, helped to roll out new policies more quickly. We agreed with the platforms that they would promote links to the World Health Organization and health authorities and remove ads that offered fake medicines or inflate prices for normal products or give very dangerous advice, which we already heard from Joseph. These actions brought results. For example, Google blocked or removed globally over 80 million coronavirus—related ads. But there is room for improvement and our code was just a first step. We need to ensure transparency and accountability. Citizens need to know how information is reaching them and where it comes from. Our joint communication calls on the platforms to step up their efforts and to report monthly on their policies and actions to address COVID—19—related disinformation – not to report to the Commission, to report to the public, so that people can read about what’s happening online. The targets – well, it’s about us, it’s about the citizens of Europe. Lying is neither new nor that scary in itself. What scares me is that we believe in those lies too easily. This is why we need to become more resilient and critical as a society. We need to support free and independent media – the fact—checkers and researchers. And we have to step up our education. We will have the Digital Education Action Plan soon, adopted by the Commission, and there will be a very strong chapter on how to become more resilient and increase our critical thinking through education.  We will support fact-checking and research activities through the recently established European Digital Media Observatory. In this context, later this month, we will launch a EUR 9 million call for research hubs in the different Member States.  Also, we have to speak in this context about the freedom of speech, which remains our basic principle. Laws which define criminal penalties for spreading disinformation in too broad terms, and with disproportionate sanctions, can damage accountability mechanisms, which are just as important as ever. It can make the work of journalists more difficult, cause self—censorship and damage freedom of expression. This is not the European way. It is bad for democracies and it is self—defeating. Our best defence against disinformation are free and plural media, informed and active citizens and resilient democratic institutions in which they can trust.  I really want to insist on this because I believe this is a distinctive part of our policies. I do not want to create any Ministry of Truth. I used to live in a system, before 1989, with only one official truth, no pluralism of media, opinion, or even thought.  A competitive market of ideas enabled by free speech is essential in democracies. Just as in traditional competition policy where consumers benefit from fair competition and a level playing field, citizens benefit from fair competition of free speech. To conclude, the communication is the first building block of this new Commission in response to disinformation. We are working on the Digital Services Act and the European Democracy Action Plan where we will address illegal content and harmful content like disinformation.  In this context, I really appreciate that we can work on this together with the committee which you established in Parliament, because I believe that common work can bring good fruit.

I would like to remind you that in the first pages of the Bible it is already told how the serpent deceives Adam and Eve to drive man out of paradise, defying God. But are we talking about misinformation or are we talking about censorship and ending freedom of expression? I am very concerned that the Commission will turn these data verification companies into the subjects who say what is true and what is a lie. And I am concerned that, on top of that, they will receive public aid, because they are only private companies in the service of their own political or economic interests. The coronavirus crisis has taught us that no one is foolproof. And here everyone has misinformed, starting with China, the World Health Organization, governments themselves and the media. Believing that truth is going to be fabricating in this Parliament is an act of unacceptable pride, like Adam and Eve's.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 58, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Eugen TOMAC", "mepid": "197672", "text": "   – Madam President, High Representative, Madam Vice-President, it is obvious that during this period, in addition to the coronavirus crisis, we experienced this shock called the information pandemic, which must be said exactly as it happened because the truth must not be avoided in this situation.

We face the new factor of lying in the political debate, which has the potential to win elections. We will have to discuss all these very substantial but at the same time sensitive issues.

There have been very important, interesting contributions. Some very original, such as referring the origins of misinformation to Adam and Eve. It had not occurred to me that Adam, deep down, was the victim of the misinformation propagated by Eve, who did not warn her of the consequences of eating the apple. Well, yes, it's possible that Eva was the victim of misinformation. But today, in our world, we must recognize something that I believe is at the basis of our debate. Democracy is a system that works on the basis of the information that citizens have. Citizens choose. And to choose, they need to be informed of the options presented to them and value the action of governments, and that requires freedom of information, plurality of information and truthfulness in information. If citizens get misinformation, they can't make good choices, because it's like a plane that has the wrong navigation system. He'll end up crashing. And so it is so important that we fight to ensure that information, understood as a public good, is available to citizens and citizens have verification systems that let them know if someone is telling them a milonga — in castizo, castizo Castilian — if anyone is lying to them. Because I do not believe — whatever the Austrian poet in question says - that there is a part of truth and a part of lies in everything. Not really. Look, there are things that are clearly true and other things that are clearly false. That 2 and 2 are 4 in the base system 10, that has nothing false, it is true one hundred percent. And there are things that are absolutely false, say it whoever says it. That there are elements of opinion in some information in which one may be for or against for reasons of taste, opinion, ideological inclination... right, of course. Others, there would be no political debate. But one thing is the proper assessment of the facts and another thing is the facts. And as my colleague has said, we do not intend to create the Ministry of Truth. She already had one in her country; I also had one, in Spain, when there was a Ministry of Information. No, we do not intend to create the ministry that controls what we may or may not know. We intend to help citizens to be able to distinguish truth from lies. And that's the basis of the democratic system. If we are not able to do that, our democracy will be profoundly imperfect and will not end up being so.

At the same time, it is essential to work with all groups in society in cooperation with the media and public organisations, with a particular focus on seniors. I believe that media literacy should be given priority in the future Digital Education Action Plan. We need to strengthen editorially independent media and quality journalism. The pandemic has fuelled media awareness as part of critical democracy infrastructure, but at the same time exacerbated the market failures observed in the industry over the years, particularly sharply felt by the media operating in small markets, including local and regional ones. The EU needs to increase funding available to the media industry and address systemic issues of regulating online platforms.

I call for a doubling of the creative Europe budget and for substantial funding for the news media to be increased. The EU must also introduce a digital tax as soon as possible and channel revenues to support the media industry. At the same time, I hope that the Member States will make effective use of the instruments provided for in the Recovery Plan, with adequate funding being invested in the news media as one of the most affected ecosystems.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lv", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 83, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Andrey SLABAKOV", "mepid": "197849", "text": "  in writing. – Dear colleagues, I listen to your speeches and think of a message Matthew attributes to Jesus Christ: \"And why are you looking at the straw in your brother's eye and not paying attention to the beam in your eye?\" For years, the European Union has been debating whether and what measures to take, against whom, how serious.

The Eastern Partnership is about closer association between the European Union and six partner countries. The extent of these relations and positive results of the European Union’s support and action in its immediate neighbourhood will determine the Union’s odds of global leadership. Leadership requires a strong commitment. Such commitment should be demonstrated by passing a historically justified and politically endorsed message to our partners that ‘their European aspirations are recognised and that by working together we can achieve necessary reform progress’. It is only a matter of time.  Our motto for the next decade of the Eastern Partnership should be ‘more for more’ and lead towards gradual and differentiated integration. It should be conditioned on the application of European values and democratic principles.  I very much regret that Mr Borrell is leaving the Chamber, although CommissionerVárhelyi is here. I have a very personal message for him as well.  In the political area, our partners require continuous support and guidance in strengthening their democracies, ensuring the rule of law and fighting corruption. As in the economic field, we should gradually open access to the EU single market by creating a common economic area. Let us remind ourselves that European security is indivisible. We cannot look at it through the Eastern or Western dimensions. There is only one, European, dimension and it is time to act as such. The Eastern Partnership initiative is rightly called a success story and will remain such as long as we act together, united by a common vision and joint action, dialogue and partnership.   Commissioner Várhelyi, as you know from today’s news from the prison in Belarus, the leader of the Christian Democratic Party has cut his veins in protest at violence and injustice.

The main message of this report is to once again provide strong support of the European Parliament in the continuation of the enlargement process as one of the European Union’s more successful and strategic policies. Enlargement is our most effective foreign policy instrument contributing to extending the outreach of the Union’s core values, fostering peace and prosperity, equality, rule of law and respect for human rights across Europe. This report highlights what is often forgotten: the merit-based prospect of full EU membership for the Western Balkans countries is in the Union’s own political security and economic interests, as well as it is in the interest of the countries seeking full membership. For the first time after the accession of Croatia in 2013, enlargement policy is again on the political agenda of the institutions. We welcome a new enhanced methodology breakthrough with the council’s approval to start negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania on the Zagreb Summit Declaration. Now we need the implementation of those decisions and proposals in concrete form and dates for starting accession negotiations. We would like to see a faster pace of closing chapters for the countries already negotiating, following more efficient scrutiny and supervision of their progress. It goes without saying that ambitious enlargement policy requires an adequate budget. Therefore the Council should provide for sufficient budgetary means in support of the enlargement policy. On the parliamentary role of cooperation, the European Parliament is committed to intensifying political and institutional support for reforms in the Western Balkan countries in the process of EU accession. Lastly, enlargement is a necessary condition for the EU’s credibility and influence in the region and beyond.

These are not just words: we have translated them into action. Let me start with the Western Balkans, a region at the heart of Europe and surrounded by our Member States. In the first six months of our mandate we have first, in February, proposed a revised enlargement methodology. The aim was to make the accession negotiations more credible, more predictable, more dynamic and guided by a stronger political steer. Second, and despite the COVID pandemic, in March the Council adopted a decision to open accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania, and I’m pleased that both these decisions have been confirmed by the European Council. To support the region hit by the pandemic, in April, the Commission put forward an unparalleled financial package of EUR 3.3 billion, mobilised together with the European Investment Bank. In addition, we associated the Western Balkans to a number of initiatives normally reserved for our Member States only. In May, we had the Zagreb Summit, where EU leaders not only reiterated our strong solidarity with the region but also reaffirmed the region’s European perspective and sent a message of enhanced engagement from the EU side. The Commission was tasked to come forward with a substantial economic development and investment plan to accelerate the reforms and the catching-up of the region. Still this week, the Commission will propose the draft negotiating frameworks for Albania and North Macedonia to the Council, together with an update on the progress made. We look forward to the adoption and the first intergovernmental conferences soon. Enlargement is merit-based. To progress on their EU path, the Western Balkan countries need to continue to deliver on the reforms. Further work is required on the rule of law, the fight against corruption and organised crime, as well as on fundamental freedoms and human rights. Fast and tangible results on reform mean moving faster in accession negotiations, as was underlined in the enhanced methodology. The Commission will look at the progress achieved in the annual package to be presented in the autumn. Also in the autumn, we will come forward with an economic and investment plan for the Western Balkans to support the long-term economic recovery and to bring the region closer to the EU. The plan will reflect many areas identified in your report, such as connectivity (especially in transport and energy), green transition and digital transformation. This plan should bring growth and jobs to the region, also as part of our common recovery effort after the pandemic. Let me now focus on the eastern neighbourhood. Let me thank this House for your overall support for the vision on the future of the Eastern Partnership that we have put forward with the joint communication adopted in March. Our commitment towards the Eastern Partnership and its future was emphasised at last week’s Foreign Affairs Ministerial Conference, together with our partner countries. I am convinced that it will also be confirmed at the leaders meeting later this afternoon. Our aim is to build, together with the partner countries, an ambitious, flexible and inclusive partnership that constitutes and continues to bring concrete results to the people. In this context, I am proud that the EU is delivering close to EUR 2.5 billion in support for our eastern partners in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to grants, this includes very substantial macrofinancial assistance in loans on highly favourable terms to help the countries cover their immediate urgent financing needs and strengthen their macroeconomic stability. This package also helps to save jobs as part of the economic recovery in the region by providing liquidity to the whole of the economy and by direct financial support to the SMEs. This crisis has further underlined how important resilience is as the overarching framework for our relations, and it will be at the heart of the Eastern Partnership going forward. Our March communication puts forward an ambitious vision for our future cooperation through five broad policy objectives. First, to work towards resilient economies with strengthened connectivity. Second, to support the development of accountable institutions, the rule of law and security. Third, to support the green transformation and work on environmental and climate resilience. Fourth, support the digital transformation; and fifth, to work together towards the development of resilient, fair and inclusive societies. As a next step, we will work on transforming the policy objectives into practice. Together with the Member States, partner countries and others, we will shape the post 2020 deliverables, to be endorsed at the next summit in early 2021. We count on your continuous support and cooperation to ensure a strong partnership for the years to come. Finally, to the rapporteur, Mr Auštrevičius, I will look into this issue you mentioned.

On 14 June 1985, an agreement took place in a small town in Luxembourg, then continued under the 1990 Convention and in part by the European Schengen legislation adopted by this European Parliament and which is in force.  But we must talk about Schengen especially because it does not show good health. Because Schengen is at stake. And here's the thing.

Because everyone knows that it is the most precious asset of the European experience. The asset that best distinguishes the advantages of being European. European construction. An area of free movement, without internal borders, without restrictions and without discrimination between Europeans, which is now enjoyed by more than four hundred million citizens of the European Union.  It turns out that the Schengen area is governed by European law: a Schengen Borders Code, a regulation which is directly binding on the Member States and invoking the courts in defence of European citizenship.  And it provides for conditions for the restoration of internal borders for public security reasons. But we have encountered an unprecedented situation: COVID-19. That is why the resolution following this oral question is precisely entitled 'Schengen area following the Covid—19 outbreak'. What about Schengen after COVID-19? Because the Member States have rushed to adopt unilateral, uncoordinated or interconnected measures to restore internal borders in the Union, which have produced very long queues at the Union's internal borders, caused police overload, caused problems in the supply of essential goods and also for seasonal workers, also protected by European law. We need to talk about all these problems in this oral question and that is why we have made it clear to you, first of all, whether you consider that the measures and restrictions that have been brought are respectful of the Schengen Borders Code, which lays down three principles: mutual trust, solidarity, but also the requirement of respect for law. And it is true that public security has been invoked more than once for the restoration of internal borders, especially after terrorist attacks. We've seen it. But public health has never been. It is covered by the Schengen Borders Code for the restoration of the Union's external borders, but not for the interiors; therefore, it is a lesson that we have to learn. Secondly, how does Schengen recovery envisage? We're talking about the recovery plan. How to recover Schengen to be fully operational as soon as possible?  Thirdly, how can we ensure that controls are exceptional, as the Schengen Borders Code wants, and in any case time-limited, time framed, with strict temporary restrictions? Fourthly, what practical measures can we take to ensure coordination and accountability, coordinated, of course, by the Commission — guardian of the Treaties and European law — in the face of common challenges.  I ask for a vote in favour of the resolution resulting from this oral question by, of course, thanking the work of the Schengen Scrutiny Group, represented here by its President Tanja Fajon, but I recall that, first of all, the content of the Resolution is a message to the Commission so that improvisation, uncoordination, decisions, and decisions will never take place , nor unilateral measures; that there is no dynamic or spiral of action-reaction of one State against another, let alone retaliations, based (inaudible words) on mutual trust, solidarity and coordination and respect for law. We are working for the health of the Schengen area. And finally, let me say that I am aware that this House (inaudible words) has enemies within the European Parliament, as it has (inaudible words), which take advantage of any situation for (inaudible words) the restoration of the Internal Borders of the Union. It should be noted that the majority of Parliament is committed to the Schengen recovery plan. He said it is essential to bet on a Schengen recovery plan to restore its health based on the principles of solidarity, mutual trust and non-discrimination between Europeans under no circumstances. Yesterday we debated racism here. The motto was \"Black lives matter\". Sure they do, and this gives me the right to say: \"Schengen matters, too\", \"Schengen matters\".  Black lives matter. Sure they do. (continues in English) Schengen matters too. (English) European law matters. European law matters even in times of crisis, even throughout the crisis. It must leave European law even throughout the crisis and learn out of experience. I would even add: European law matters especially in times of crisis, especially in times of COVID. (Spanish) full recovery (Spanish) That is why, after this oral question, we conclude with a resolution that bets on the full recovery of Schengen, the full restoration of its good health.

In addition to a very heavy toll on human lives, the COVID—19 pandemic has jeopardised certain fundamental elements of the European project, such as the internal market and the freedom of movement. I believe you would all agree with me that throughout this most critical period the absolute priority has, understandably, been to slow down and eventually stop the very rapid spreading of the virus. To that effect, many Member States have been forced to take legislative and practical measures which had a significant impact on free movement. In this context, the reintroduction of internal border controls was considered indispensable, even by some Member States which before the COVID—19 pandemic had been highly sceptical towards the application of such measures.  According to the Schengen Border Code, the reintroduction and prolongation of temporary internal border controls as a last resort and in response to a serious threat to public health can take place at the discretion of the Member States. Their application is, of course, subject to the fulfilment of the conditions set out in the relevant provisions. Neither the Commission, as the guardian of the Treaties, nor any Member State, has signalled any issue related to compliance with these conditions. Furthermore, I would like to stress that since the outbreak of the pandemic all Member States have been working tirelessly, with the political steering of the Council and the coordinating support of the Commission, in order to mitigate the side—effects of the measures imposed on the free movement of their citizens.  A series of Commission communications have been implemented by the Member States by way of priority to ensure the free flow of essential goods such as food, medicine and personal protection items, as well as the transfer of key cross—border workers and the repatriation of EU citizens and residents. At the same time, Member States have applied, in a coordinated way, restrictions on any unnecessary travel towards the EU.  At the second stage, as the overall health situation has started to improve, Member States have started easing the measures and full restoration of free movement within the European Union. This phasing—out entails, in some cases, a gradual approach and the replacement of internal border controls with alternative measures such as police controls within the territory. At any rate, Member States, with the support of the Commission, are strongly committed to applying any measures still temporarily needed, in full compliance with the principles of proportionality and non—discrimination. Most Member States and Schengen associate countries lifted internal border controls and related travel restrictions by mid-June. The rest intend to follow suit by the end of the month.  We are aware that there are still many steps to be taken, especially regarding the coherent lifting of external border restrictions. The fact that the lifting of internal border control in a coordinated way has been set in motion without major problems provides ample evidence of the Member States’ strong will for a fully—functioning Schengen area. I am hopeful that we can use this positive momentum, along with the possible proposals that we expect from the Commission regarding the legal framework for internal border controls, to launch a fruitful debate between the two co—legislators on this crucial subject, to safeguard the Schengen area. Any future amendments to the regime governing internal border control need to be stipulated in such a way as to provide credible answers to threats to public order, internal security and public health. They should ensure the strictly necessary and proportionate flexibility for Member States and leave no scope for any abuse in their application.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 3, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 96, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Ylva Johansson", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Schengen is one of the major achievements and very much appreciated by our citizens, as was very rightly stressed by Mr Fernando López Aguilar, Chair of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE). I would also say that Schengen has passed not only a celebration of 35 years, but has also just passed a major test. At no time was Schengen more important than in the last few months. All Member States took drastic measures to protect our citizens from the virus. Most Schengen countries introduced temporary internal border controls in addition to other measures restricting free movement across the European Union. Altogether, these measures helped to save tens of thousands of lives but had serious consequences for freedom of movement and a large social and economic cost. On 5 April this year, the President of the European Commission and the President of the European Council presented a joint European roadmap towards lifting COVID—19 containment measures. In line with the principles established in this roadmap, the Commission presented, on 13 May, a communication setting out a coordinated, balanced and phased approach for lifting travel restrictions and controls at the internal borders. In the second stage, this also looked ahead to the ending of restrictions on non—essential travel to the EU through the external borders. Due to the improvement of the epidemiological situation, by this Monday most Member States had lifted internal border controls and restrictions, including post—travel quarantine requirements. The Commission has strongly encouraged the remaining Member States also to lift internal border controls and restrictions to free movement by air, land and water within the European Union at the same time. I expect that all internal border checks will have been lifted by the end of June before we start relaxing the external border restrictions. The Schengen rules provide Member States with a certain discretion to reintroduce border controls for two or six months at specific border sections or at all their internal borders. Member States should set up specific authorised border crossing points. Through bilateral contacts with Ministers and my regular video conferences with all the Schengen Ministers, based on the work at technical level of the COVID—19 information group (Home Affairs), we could address many issues and solve many problems, also regarding the scope of reintroduced border controls. In this emergency related to COVID—19, the Commission is of the opinion that EU Member States and Schengen states complied with the requirements of the Schengen Borders Code. Since 2015, six Schengen states have also reintroduced border controls under the Schengen Borders Code, following the recommendation of the Council, motivated by extraordinary irregular migration, secondary movements, the external border situation and terrorist threats. These controls have been prolonged and prolonged and prolonged until the end of October / mid—November this year. The Commission consistently encouraged alternatives to border controls, which may assure similar results. This concerns police checks, which, as explained in the recommendation of 12 May 2017 on proportionate police checks, can also be carried out in the border area and as such can replace non—systematic border checks. In 2017, the Commission also proposed an amendment to the Schengen governance rules with substantial reinforcement of procedural safeguards to ensure that the reintroduction of border controls is truly only a last-resort measure. As you know, the negotiations on these proposals are blocked, but recent experience with the use of border controls to address public health threats deserves further reflection. The Commission is committed to lead a process of reflection about the legal and practical steps needed to improve our response and better prepare our societies for similar emergencies. In particular, we have to be able to provide, in the case of pandemics, a coherent EU response at the internal and external borders. Currently, the EU can only intervene in the case of serious persistent threats at external borders, putting the overall functioning of the Schengen area at risk. COVID shows the need for better anticipation and for simplified or standardised procedures to be followed under the pressure of events. Decisions on the temporary reintroduction of border controls should be subject to consultation, including, where appropriate, joint meetings between the Member State concerned and the Commission. As the experience of recent months has shown, this provision of the Schengen Borders Code is rarely used in an emergency situation. The new pact on migration and asylum that I will present soon will be the occasion to launch a process to restore trust between Member States and return to a fully-functioning Schengen area. We will reflect on how to ensure coordination among the Member States during emergencies in the future and on the future of Schengen and how to make sure its legal framework and implementation are ready for new challenges.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 97, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Paulo RANGEL", "mepid": "96903", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Mr President, Schengen is undoubtedly one of the pillars of the European Union.

Member States panicked and to protect their citizens reacted understandably with the unilateral and uncoordinated closure of borders.  Now we must ensure that there is a breakthrough for Schengen, a Schengen recovery, made with respect for the idea of coordination and articulation, and so I want to congratulate the Commission and thank the Commission for the effort it has made and which, unfortunately, I must say to the Council, the Member States have not always followed to coordinate and articulate the replacement of the Schengen area throughout the Union. It has been a huge effort that has not always been monitored by the Member States.  That is what Parliament supports here.  And now let me only stress one point – even to my President Lopez Aguilar – because it's not true that the Schengen Borders Code doesn't allow public health, because a serious threat to public policy includes public health in a pandemic and/or epidemic outbreak.

First of all, a sincere thank you for all the cooperation and meetings of the last few weeks. I know that you are aware of the importance of restoring Schengen, because without the renewal of schengen, colleagues, there will be no reconstruction of the European economy. We're at a critical moment. Schengen is celebrating this year, this week, 35 years and has never been as seriously threatened as it is today. In the health crisis, it emerged that the outbreak of the epidemic, that countries reacted very egotistically, that there was no harmonisation, there was no concerted action, that most of them closed borders, that there was no movement of people, people could not return home, there was no supply of medical equipment and medical staff. We were not prepared for this situation and we need clear rules to avoid this. You yourself mentioned schengen has long been a serious test. For four years, six countries have been introducing internal controls without legal basis and without any real arguments. These border closures, these behaviours by governments and these actions by these countries call into question the whole of Schengen and the whole European integration project. And I wonder whether the measures were really justified. In Slovenia, Nova Gorica, man would be much easier to go to Stare Gorica, an Italian Mountain than maybe 100 km away in Maribor. We must also ask ourselves whether the measures were proportionate and effective. And I would very much like to remind you, colleagues, when we talk about a common migration and asylum policy, if we link this issue to the issue of Schengen action and reform, we will lose the project. Both packages of legislation, both migration and asylum policy and schengen reform, both packages of legislation have been adopted in this building and responsibility lies with the countries of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 99, "date": "2020-06-18.json", "name": "Dragoş TUDORACHE", "mepid": "197665", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew group. – Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, in the last plenary session I honoured Robert Schuman.

We add another thirty-five years and we come to what Schengen represents today: a fundamental freedom of European citizens, one that we have a duty to defend and strengthen. The pandemic has put the Schengen area to the test. We all felt the bitter taste of a Europe with borders and restrictions. The lack of coordination between the Member States, the too timid language of the European Commission and the closed borders have led European citizens to question our entire construction.

We have learned that we need each other, that we must support each other in difficult times, and that our resilience, that of Europe, depends on the resilience of all.

I think we have to start by acknowledging that Schengen has been at breaking point since 2015. Internal border controls, which are only ever supposed to be allowed on a temporary basis as a measure of last resort, are being thrown up by Member States as and when they like: reintroduced and prolonged 50 times since 2015. At this stage, totally illegal, but the Commission has not acted to sanction these states. Of course you haven’t, when we’re talking about countries like Germany in April this year extending border controls with Austria under the threat of migration.

Schengen is a major achievement, and this is shown by the great engagement in this Parliament for this issue and for Schengen coming back to a fully functioning Schengen area. When this first Schengen agreement was signed 35 years ago, there were millions of Europeans that didn’t even have the right to leave their own country. The last few months have reminded us what Europe looks like without free movement.  Now slowly and responsibly we are regaining our freedoms. We cannot take the freedom of movement for granted. Nor, for that matter, the significant benefits of European integration. We need to work hard every day to preserve and protect our common European project. To begin with, I would like to see the necessary decision in Council to welcome the waiting Member States into Schengen, but in the long run, we have to do better than a return to the status quo. And it must go without saying that, of course, all Member States, all Schengen members and all those that would like to be members of Schengen have to fully respect their fundamental rights and the European acquis of course.  A well-functioning Schengen area depends on mutual trust among Member States and on a correct and efficient implementation of the Schengen acquis. Differences in one Member State can affect all Member States and subsequently put the Schengen area at risk.  We must continue to make sure the Schengen legal framework is fit for purpose, so that it can meet new challenges such as the current health emergency.  First, through better and more correct implementation. That includes alternatives for internal border checks, such as police controls inside the territory supported by technology and reinforced cross-border cooperation and information exchange between law enforcement authorities.

Working away from home is hard enough. Protecting this vulnerable group of workers is therefore even more pressing especially during these times of unprecedented challenges following the outbreak of the COVID—19 pandemic.  Confinement and social distancing measures have had a substantial negative effect on the European economy. Unemployment rates have risen within a short period and businesses are facing difficulties, some sectors more than others. Member States have implemented a large number of measures to prevent and mitigate severe economic implications on labour markets and national social security and welfare systems. Many of these measures aim to protect workers in particularly sensitive sectors of the economy.  While the health emergency is slowly receding and confinement measures are gradually being lifted, the economic and social difficulties remain intense. On 5 May, a video conference organised by the Presidency offered the opportunity to employment and social policy Ministers to share their views on existing strategies. While underlining the importance of a quick economic recovery, Ministers expressed their support for strategies built on a coordinated approach, safeguarding employability, supporting businesses and protecting groups in need.  The issue of cross—border and seasonal workers was brought up many times throughout the discussions. This vulnerable group is considered essential for many economic sectors. It has a vital role to play in the economic recovery and its members should not be discriminated against.  The COVID—19 pandemic forced Member States to close their borders temporarily. Nevertheless, Member States and the members of the European Council indicated clearly in a joint statement on 26 March that smooth border management for persons and goods should be assured in order to preserve the functioning of the single market. While some Member States have already lifted all travel restrictions for cross—border and seasonal workers, others have committed to do so as soon as possible. Ensuring safe working conditions is as important as ensuring free movement. It is essential that this vulnerable group of workers enjoy equal treatment to that provided for workers who are nationals of the host Member State. They should receive adequate protection equipment and, where provided, they should be offered adequate accommodation in compliance with social distancing measures. Moreover, workers should be trained and informed about changes and new procedures.  Member States are also committed to ensuring access to affordable social security for all citizens in cross—border situations. The revision of regulations on the coordination of the social security system would further facilitate the free movement of workers and would act as a catalyst for modernising the national social security system.

Millions of Europeans live or work in a Member State other than that of their nationality. We estimate that more than half a million workers are covering seasonal work in the EU. The COVID—19 crisis has led to unprecedented measures across EU Member States, having a direct impact on the free movement of workers, as was shown in the previous debates.  The role of the Commission is clear – ensure free movement of workers. In this context, on 30 March the Commission published guidelines concerning the exercise of the free movement of workers. The goal was for frontier, posted and seasonal workers exercising critical occupations to have unhampered access to their workplace. We talk a lot about frontline workers and I have to repeat that among these frontline workers there are a lot also of seasonal workers who have played an indispensable role and have worked for critical goods and services like, for instance, foods.  To ensure further clarity regarding social security, the Commission also published a fact sheet of questions and answers, including information for the attention of frontier and posted workers affected by the restrictions on free movement related to COVID—19. Based on the dialogue with Member States and stakeholders, we note that the guidelines have had a positive effect. We continue to monitor that the measures adopted by the Member States are necessary and proportionate for the fight against the spread of the virus and non—discriminatory.  Important sectors of the European economy, in particular the agricultural and tourism sectors, require the support of seasonal workers for specific periods of the year. Seasonal workers are often vulnerable to abuses and precarious working and living conditions, including health and safety, access to public services and decent housing, infringement of labour law and inadequate social security coverage. They are also more exposed to undeclared work, in particular in the form of unregistered employment.  The COVID—19 pandemic rendered more visible and acute the problems that many seasonal workers have faced for longer periods. While the situation has been improving recently, significant problems for seasonal workers still persist and need to be addressed. The principle applied to seasonal workers is very, very clear – equal treatment and no discrimination of EU mobile workers compared with national workers. This ensures the best protection for EU mobile workers, including for cross—border and seasonal workers. It means, for seasonal workers, they have exactly the same rights as nationals or residents of the Member State in which they work.  Equal treatment requires proper application of national labour law, including those laws which result, from EU directives, to mobile workers. Given that certain sectors of the economy, and especially the agricultural sector, require the support of seasonal workers from other Member States, the Commission asked Member States to exchange information and establish specific procedures to ensure smooth circulation for such workers. In this respect, I welcome the joint declaration on the protection of seasonal workers signed on 15 May by the European social partners in agriculture. I also welcome the announcement by a Member State to adapt its national legislation and to better control its application.  Our data confirms that the seasonal activities are exposed to undeclared work, often associated with abuses or limited access to social rights and health and safety for workers. In this context, it is essential to raise workers’ and employers’ awareness towards the benefits of declared work and the transition to declared work. This is actually the focus of the EU for Fair Work campaign of the European platform on tackling undeclared work. Europe can also play a role in this context by developing actions with a focus on activities for cross—border workers, seasonal workers and, especially, young people. In the near future, both the platform and the US—European coordination office will be transferred to the European Labour Authority (ELA). Once fully operational, the ELA will assist Member States and the Commission in the effective application and enforcement of Union law related to labour mobility across the Union and the coordination of social security systems within the Union.  One of the aims of the EU rules on social security coordination is to ensure that persons who work in two or more Member States, such as seasonal workers, are subject to the legislation of the Member State with which they have the closest links, promoting stable and continuous social security coverage. Frequent changes in the applicable social security legislation may create an obstacle to the free movement of workers.  I am convinced that the mutual assistance and cooperation between Member States, such as the conclusion of bilateral agreements or making available information in the language of the seasonal workers on social security issues is essential to protect the rights of seasonal workers. The revision of the Social Security Regulation for which the Commission made a proposal back in 2016 is still being discussed between Parliament and Council. I am fully committed to help you finalising this important modernisation of the rules as soon as possible. I also want to repeat my full support for the introduction of a European social security number, requested in your draft resolution.  Let me also make an important point on the health and safety of workers. Given the unprecedented crisis we are going through, this is one of the issues where we cannot fail our citizens. We have solid EU legislation on health and safety at work that applies to all workers, independently of the country where they work, the duration of the assignment or the precise tasks carried out. Ensuring the health and safety of workers is our shared responsibility. It is the employer’s obligation to comply with all requirements and assess all possible risks at work, including new ones, and to put in place adequate preventive and protective measures. The completeness of this evaluation is particularly important in sectors where workers may be particularly exposed. Employers are also obliged to provide workers with related information as well as necessary protective equipment and hygiene products. Besides the guidelines on seasonal workers under preparation by the Commission, the EU has taken numerous steps to support Member States in this regard. But I have to add that it is Member States’ responsibility to control the application of the rights and labour standards which are also applicable to seasonal workers.  The EU European Agency for Health and Safety at Work has published guidance addressing COVID—19 at the workplace, as well as the safe and healthy return to workplaces after COVID. These documents assist employers in dealing with health and safety aspects at work. They also refer to the relevant national guidance for specific sectors and occupations, including those that are particularly susceptible to employ seasonal workers.  I assure you that the protection of workers’ health and safety is one of my main priorities for the years to come. I will be working closely with the members of the European Parliament, notably in view of updating the strategic framework of health and safety at work that will provide us with opportunities to look at post—COVID—19 health and safety implications at the workplace, including for the most vulnerable workers.  We are not forgetting that many seasonal workers are third country nationals and the COVID—19 crisis has had a significant impact on the possibility for these workers to enter the Union. The Commission considers that these workers, in particular in the agricultural sector, often have an essential function. Therefore, already in March, we recommended Member States to authorise the entry of non—EU seasonal workers in agriculture, despite the closure of the EU external border.  I welcome your resolution as an important contribution to future policy making. We want to achieve the same goal, ensuring that the rights of seasonal workers are protected, that the EU rules are enforced, and that the pillar of social rights applies to everybody.

Seasonal and cross-border workers are the heart of which pumps energy to many sectors of the European economy. They are citizens who leave for a shorter or longer time from their families in Romania, Bulgaria, Poland, Portugal or Spain and help to operate important industries from other Member States. They are also financial support for those they leave at home, for their families and children.  We have, in the European Union, whole sectors that depend on seasonal workers. We have seen in the crisis that we are going through that when these citizens cannot move between borders, food production, transport, many tourism services or other social, care and medical services are at risk.  I say all these things to understand the importance of these workers to the Union, to the Member States, to larger or smaller farms, to construction firms, to hospitals, hotels or transport firms. For these reasons, I believe that protecting them, where they work, is part of a minimal respect that we owe to these people without which many key economic sectors would be blocked.  However, we have seen in this crisis that many of the seasonal workers are accommodated in squalid conditions, that they are not provided with minimum hygiene conditions and, after they become ill, do not get adequate medical treatment. I have even seen people who have died because of negligence and the fact that their social rights are not respected. That is why, on behalf of the Renew Group, we have initiated this resolution and I am pleased that we have broad support for this.  We owe it to these people with the clarity of the rules in which they operate, with the constant monitoring of accommodation conditions and with the suspension of the activity of companies that try to trick them.

Oftentimes they have had to choose whether to stay with their family and lose their jobs or, conversely, whether they go to work, remain isolated from the family for months. Of course, some segments, such as agriculture, social services or the transport of goods, have suffered from an acute shortage of workers by the fact that many have not got to work. These people are in permanent social insecurity because they stand in two or more social systems. They are often discriminated against. Let's look at the Austrian indexation of family allowances.

There, our concerns have been heeded that there is no functioning system in the Czech Republic for preventing and detecting conflicts of interest. Systematic or systemic opacity and a wide division of responsibilities make it extremely difficult to effectively control and avoid conflicts of interest.  In addition, the highest audit authority seems to be severely restricted in its work. Freedom of the media is becoming increasingly problematic and pressure is being exerted on civil servants. The key message of the motion for a resolution is that if a serious conflict of interest is confirmed, it must be resolved immediately.  There are basically three ways of doing this: eliminating the economic interest, ending the receipt of subsidies or abstaining from decisions that may in any way promote the conflict of interest.
