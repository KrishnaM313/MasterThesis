First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate all the honourable Members on your success in the recent European elections. I am also very pleased that, as a result of yesterday’s vote in Parliament, we now have a new President of the Commission and we can start working together to build a better future for Europe. It is important that the gender balance is now good as we think about the Commission situation. As the representative of the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, I would like to stress my full commitment to constructive cooperation with the European Parliament. For this purpose, our Minister for European Affairs, Tytti Tuppurainen, will represent the Council in the plenaries. The foundations of the European Union were laid in a divided continent ravaged by war. The founders of our Union shared a common vision and belief in the future. The people dreamed of, and had expectations for, peace and stability for the whole continent. In other words, they wanted the unity of Europe. For many decades now, the EU has fulfilled these expectations. EU cooperation has deepened as the Member States have come to realise that together we are stronger. Nowhere else in the world is there anything to compare with this unique form of cooperation between nations. ‘Unique’ is indeed the right word to describe the story of the European Union. Only 30 years ago, our continent was still divided by barbed wire and walls. Since then, a whole generation has been born and raised who have never known anything other than free movement across borders. Our continent, which suffered the horrors of war and dictatorship and witnessed a genocide 75 years ago, is now the strongest defender of democracy, human rights and peace in the world. The EU is a living example of how we can learn from the past: that peace overcomes war; that hope is stronger than despair. In recognition of this unique story, the European Union received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2012. Maybe, the peace prize was also meant to be a reminder to us: while keeping the peace, it is now our responsibility to meet new expectations. For the EU, this unique story is a source of pride. But, as I said, that pride also means we bear great responsibility, as the EU is now the object of these new expectations. While maintaining stability and peace is still one of the EU’s core tasks, many other big questions remain unanswered. We have all seen that the EU’s values – the rule of law, human rights, equality and democracy – are being challenged. Europe’s economic growth has slowed. This has not only led to growing unemployment and inequality but is also paving the way for the rise of populism and extremism. In this regard, we need to find long-term, comprehensive solutions to migration. The EU’s unity has also been tested, and will be tested, by the prospect of the United Kingdom’s withdrawal. We believe that it is better to seek answers to complex questions together rather than alone. For Finland, this is our third presidency of the Council of the European Union. Many things have changed since the previous presidencies in 1999 and 2006. Some things, however, remain the same. One of them is the pragmatic way Finland will run its Council presidency. Another is the close relationship between the presidency and the European Parliament. In Finland, our Parliament plays a strong role in EU decision-making. The Finnish Parliament has the right – and obligation – to express its views on EU matters that fall within its decision-making powers. We have found this active parliamentary engagement to be very useful, as is the continuous dialogue between government and parliament. Within the EU, we again have an opportunity to build a close and pragmatic, forward-looking relationship between the EU institutions. I believe we can achieve this and meet the expectations of our citizens by taking the lead in addressing the major challenges ahead. Finland has just launched its presidency of the Council, and in this role we can make an impact on the future of the EU. That future should be socially, economically and ecologically sustainable. In fact, the slogan for our presidency neatly states this goal: Sustainable Europe – Sustainable Future. To this end, the priorities for the Finnish Presidency are: first, to strengthen the EU’s position as a global leader in climate action; second, to strengthen common values and the rule of law; third, to make the EU more competitive and socially inclusive; and fourth, comprehensively to protect the security of citizens. A key priority of the Finnish Presidency is the EU’s global leadership on climate action. We already have in place the most ambitious targets among the industrialised economies and we have a binding legal framework that will deliver our current commitments – but we must not stop there. For the European Union, leadership means committing to climate neutrality by 2050. Our aim is to reach agreement on the main elements of this plan by the end of 2019. As the necessary measures will have an impact on all sectors of society, these measures to tackle climate change must be carried out in a socially sustainable way. We need to boost employment with the help of the bioeconomy and circular economy, for example. This is how we can make the EU the world’s most competitive and socially inclusive low-carbon economy. The European Union is, first and foremost, a community of values. It is not a store where we can choose a little bit of freedom of speech and human rights, but then decide not to pick up freedom of the press or independent courts. It doesn’t work like that in Western democracies. Human rights, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law are all values that EU countries commit to as part of their membership. These values belong together. They are the cornerstones of all EU action. But they are not just values, they are a European reality. Because of these values, European societies are safer and more secure, more stable and more prosperous than anywhere else in the world. We Europeans know better than anybody what happens if we lose sight of these values. For Finland, it is only natural that common values and the rule of law are high priorities on our presidency agenda. We look forward to working together with the European Parliament on these issues. In fact, we have close ties to the European Parliament in another way as well. As some of you may know, the first European Ombudsman, Jacob Söderman, came from Finland. During our first presidency in 1999, leaders agreed on the common priorities for justice and home affairs. We also worked closely together with the European Parliament on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Respect for the rule of law is not only a matter of protecting the rights of our citizens. It is also a matter of the proper functioning and credibility of the European Union. Our approach is positive and constructive. Finland wishes to improve and strengthen the EU’s rule-of-law toolbox and build cooperation between different entities and parties. The aim is to find better and more efficient ways to ensure respect for the EU’s common values in the Member States and to forestall potential problems. The rule-of-law dialogue in the Council will be evaluated, with the aim of taking it in a more structured and results-oriented direction. We also need to continue negotiations on how to link the receipt of EU funds more closely with respect for the rule of law. We are aiming at setting up a well-balanced and effective mechanism that will tie EU funding to compliance with the rule of law. The single market cannot function without its central principles, which are the free movement of persons, goods, services and capital. The single market, rules-based free trade and up-to-date regulations of a high standard, combined with a modern approach to industrial policy, are elements that make the EU collectively competitive. The EU now needs a positive and comprehensive long-term strategy for sustainable growth. Our two institutions and the Commission can build on the success achieved on the digital economy during the last term. Additionally, our emphasis must be on taking full advantage of research, development, innovation, services and digitalisation. An active industrial policy and development of the service sector and the digital economy will help lay the foundation for a new economy fit for the modern age. It is clear that well-being and economic policies go hand in hand. The EU works best when we increase people’s well-being and security and reduce inequality. By fostering skills, education and training, and promoting regional and social fairness, as well as gender equality, the EU will create sustainable growth. The single market, which is at the core of the European Union, should treat all workers fairly. That is why the Finnish Presidency will promote the EU’s social dimension and investments in education, training and skills. We know that new needs arise from new forms of employment and global competition. Our aim should be to make European education, training and research the best in the world. To do so we need to increase our exchanges of students and other forms of cooperation between educational institutions. We should also explore the possibility of establishing a networked European super-university, based on the existing European Universities Initiative, and substantially strengthening the Erasmus programme. Only by acting together can we defend European values and interests. The EU should aim to be a values-based global leader and defend a rules-based approach in trade. We also believe that, to be able to tackle the challenges of climate change, population growth and migration management, it is essential for us to support stability and development in Africa. I would like to thank Mr Juncker and the Commission for the excellent work done on the EU-Africa Partnership. The Finnish Presidency will work towards taking the EU-Africa partnership in the direction of greater equality, in a way that benefits both partners. At the same time, EU citizens expect us to protect their security and this should be done comprehensively. That means making progress on defence cooperation. Digital security and countering hybrid threats, such as disinformation, are also increasingly important. The Finnish Presidency aims to step up the fight against hybrid threats and build the resilience of our societies. We will organise the work of the Council in such a way that we can boost awareness and understanding of what can and must be done, in good cooperation. The next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) is one of the most important issues for the Finnish Presidency. I want to thank the Commission for its balanced proposal to modernising the MFF. Indeed, we must find a balanced solution, which reflects both new priorities and traditional policies that contribute to the common European objectives. That will enable us to meet expectations vis-à-vis the EU and to tackle the challenges I have mentioned here today. We will facilitate the final stages for reaching the Council MFF deal by the end of the year. In this work, good cooperation with the European Parliament is very important. In times of difficulty, people are heard to say that the EU should act quickly. We think that what is needed is a stronger EU position as a global leader on climate action, a strengthening of our common values and the rule of law, a more competitive and socially inclusive EU, and comprehensive protection of our citizens’ security. I believe we can meet these expectations through good cooperation with the European Parliament.

But let me first congratulate Ursula von der Leyen on her election by this House as President of the European Commission. I also want to congratulate Members of the European Parliament. In voting yesterday, you instilled the democratic legitimacy in the Presidency of the European Commission that our citizens expect. Prime Minister, it is a pleasure to see you here today soon after you hosted the College of Commissioners meeting in Helsinki just two weeks ago. As President Juncker said in Helsinki, ‘Europe needs Finland because Finland is pragmatic, down to earth and cool-headed’. That is exactly what we need in the coming months. Prime Minister, when it comes to the environment you are already leading by example. The European Union is the first major economy to have put in place a legally binding framework to deliver on what we committed to do under the Paris Agreement. We have set ambitious targets for 2030 for greenhouse gas emissions reduction, renewable energy and energy efficiency. Translating the 2030 targets into reality has to be our top priority. The Commission has also laid out its vision for the EU to become climate-neutral by 2050. Reaching climate neutrality with zero net greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 is not only possible but also economically beneficial. The energy transition will not hurt our economy but, on the contrary, will result in the creation of new jobs, new business opportunities and hundreds of billions of euros per year in reduced air-pollution damages. Finland is showing us the way ahead with the unprecedented ambition of becoming climate-neutral by 2035. I therefore have no doubt that Finland is the right country at the right time to take the European Union forward. Every part of our economy must pull its weight, and this starts with the financial sector. It is why a key pillar of complementing the capital markets union is the action plan for financing sustainable growth presented by the Commission in 2018. The idea behind the action plan is to help us make a systemic change in investment culture. Sustainability should not be seen as a niche within the financial system. It must define our financial system. I hope that our proposal will be adopted under the Finnish Presidency. It is also why the Commission has proposed that a quarter of the next long—term EU budget should be spent on climate objectives, this more than ever before. With regard to what I call the ‘industrial leg’ of our climate policy, the circular economy, our work to close the loop is now showing real results, while creating jobs for our citizens. In 2016, sectors relevant to the circular economy employed more than four million workers, 6% more than in 2012. That is the reason why the circular economy must be a solid part of our industrial policy in the future. We agreed in Sibiu last May that we would provide the Union with the means necessary to attain our objectives. To respect our commitment, we need a swift agreement on the next long—term EU budget. You can count on the support of the Commission to facilitate this process in any way we can. A swift agreement would produce numerous benefits. It would allow us to create tens of thousands of research jobs by 2021, and 100 000 projects funded under cohesion policy would start on time. It would also ensure that in 2021 a million young people can benefit from an Erasmus exchange. So let us send an unambiguous signal of our determination to conclude in the autumn with a modern balanced and unifying package that we can all support. Prime Minister, we have also injected sustainability into our trade agreements. Today, Europeans benefit from open trade with 72 countries around the world. During this mandate alone, we finalised trade agreements with 15 countries, including Japan, Canada, Singapore and Vietnam, and we have recently concluded an agreement with Mercosur. These deals send a clear message in support of open and fair, sustainable and rules-based trade. First, our agreement with Mercosur, is the biggest agreement we have ever negotiated, creating a rules-based trade area covering 780 million people, with the benefits this will bring to both sides. But, moreover, it is also an agreement in which each and every country has committed itself to the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement and, in this case, of Brazil. This includes the very significant commitment to stop deforestation in the Amazon. When we talk about rules and values-based trade today, this is what we mean and – yes – we aim to open markets and we are always ready to open our own, but in doing so we set the rules in which trade takes place. Trade for the EU means promoting a rule-based system and playing our part in shaping globalisation according to our values and principles. Industrial policy should be a key priority for our future. Industrial policy should be based on competitiveness, because competitiveness is the best friend of a generous welfare society. An industrial policy based on deepening the single market, fair trade, investment in innovation and research and development are forward-looking measures to shape our industrial policy and competitiveness. We need to maintain fair competition in the social market economy instead of pursuing protectionism. Prime Minister, I can say to you in full confidence that the Commission is in total harmony with the priorities of the next Presidency. Sustainability for Finns is part of who you are, and it must be the same for the European Union if we are to have any kind of future at all. I know that, with you, we are in the safest pair of hands in this respect. This also applies to Finland’s unwavering commitment to upholding the rule of law in the Union. By the way, this is the first time that a Member State –any Member State – takes a leading role in this file. At a time when the rule of law is under pressure, I’m pleased to see this issue remains high on the Presidency’s agenda, not only concerning the ongoing procedure under Article 7, but also concerning the strengthening of the overall rule of law framework. The rule of law is the cornerstone on which all our values rest. It makes us who we are as Europeans. But it is not a given and it can never be taken for granted. Such is the case of course when it comes to the security of the European Union. We must take responsibility for ourselves. This has been a priority of this Commission since day-one, and today the cooperation we have at the European level is unprecedented. We have witnessed terrorist attacks and cyber attacks, and we have seen interference in our elections and democratic processes. This Commission has done a lot to protect our citizens offline and online. Europe is by far the safest place to live in the world. But the nature of security issues is changing by the day. We must constantly adapt. So I very much welcome the initiative of the Finnish Presidency in this regard, particularly regarding hybrid threats. Prime Minister, I really want to wish lots of energy and strength to your work of having the rotating Presidency.

We are now starting the third Finnish EU Presidency and as we are starting the third Finnish EU Presidency, I still have a vivid memory of the first Finnish EU Presidency in the year 1999. It was the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999 which decided to start EU accession negotiations with six European countries: Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Malta and my country, Romania, were then invited to start EU accession negotiations that paved the way for the unification of Europe and for our way into the European Union and for this I would like to thank you today.  Today, we are also starting the Finnish EU Presidency at a very important moment in time. Just yesterday we voted in favour of the first female President of the European Commission, and it’s a pleasure to debate today with Finland because Finland was the first country in the world to grant full political rights to women. You are an example in gender equality and you are also a leader in Europe when it comes to education, research, innovation, digitalisation, and these are all topics which my group is supporting.  We are also ready to work with you and we are supporting you when it comes to strengthening the single market, to making the European economy more competitive, to safeguarding the external borders of the European Union, and to defending the rule of law. The rule of law is a European value and the citizens of Europe expect the European Union to play an active role in defending this value.  Now I would like to focus on two topics which are both urgent and important. Firstly, the budget of the European Union for the next seven years. The budget is a primary tool which we, the European Union, have at our disposal to transform our policy priorities into reality. This is why it is important. It is also urgent because the farmers of Europe who receive subsidies from us, the students who receive Erasmus scholarships, the villages, the cities, the regions which receive money for infrastructure and many other things need an answer from us on how much money they will receive, under what circumstances and for which projects. This is why I would kindly ask you to prioritise this dossier, to work with us, with Parliament. We have a position, we are ready to negotiate. We should agree on this file as soon as possible.  On the budget, I would also like to tell you that we do not share one of the approaches of the Finnish Presidency. You are saying funding for cohesion policy should be diminished and this House has said the following: ‘The European Union should do more, so we need a robust budget’. Cohesion is now needed more than ever in Europe. It helps the poorer countries, but it also helps the richer countries; it helps us unleash the potential of our single market; it helps consumers and enterprises in all corners of the European Union. That’s why I say don’t cut funding to cohesion. You will not find a partner in Parliament on this.  My second point, which is also urgent and important, Prime Minister, is the appointment of the first chief European Public Prosecutor of the European Union. We the European Parliament have held a hearing with three candidates. We have held two rounds of votes; in the Budgetary Control (CONT) Committee and in the Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) Committee and we have decided that the Prosecutor from Romania, Ms Laura Codruța Kövesi, is the best equipped prosecutor to hold this job. This was also confirmed by a panel of 12 experts, and this is why, Prime Minister, I call upon you, so that the Council gives confirmation of the appointment of Ms Laura Codruța Kövesi as the first European Public Prosecutor. This is urgent and important. This is urgent and important because the citizens of Europe expect us to decisively move forward with EU funds in Europe. On this note, I would like to wish you all the best for the Finnish Presidency and we’re looking forward to cooperating with you.

I would also like to convey our sincere thanks to you for presenting such an ambitious agenda for the next six months. We are very satisfied with your work program. Do not doubt that we will work with you, side by side, for a sustainable Europe. The first sentence of the Finnish Presidency's agenda says a lot about its ambition: strengthening common values and the rule of law, building a more important European Union and a leading Europe in the fight against climate change. Sure, count on our political family to meet those fundamental goals. You are right: the common denominator of all european Union action must be sustainability. We need to demonstrate with facts that we are able to pay the same attention to deficit compliance and the future of our planet. It's time to act. Inaction in the face of these problems will undermine our way of life. We need to respond to the demands and fears of millions of teenagers who have taken to the streets in favor of combating climate change. That is why we are calling for an ambitious strategy to enable us to implement the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030. This proposal should include a revision of the European Semester and the adoption of a new pact on sustainable development incorporating a set of binding objectives and indicators. This new pact must be legally binding, to ensure that economic, social and ecological objectives are of the same importance in the decision-making process. This is not a new claim, these priorities have already been called for by this European Parliament. So, it's time to act. The coming months will be crucial to our common future, as a result of institutional and Brexit changes. This Presidency also coincides with the final phase of the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework. And in this area we also have to be ambitious, because one can have an agenda that is appropriate to their priorities, but if one does not have enough budget to put it in place, it cannot be real. And that is why we need a strong budget for the period 2021-2027, which meets the needs and expectations of citizens, which can incorporate the instruments of solidarity necessary to meet the current challenges, and therefore we cannot accept cuts in cohesion policy or the common agricultural policy. In addition, we need to make sure that no one is left behind, which is why we must incorporate the social dimension into the process of European integration. It is a fundamental issue, the social dimension. To meet this goal, we must launch a fair transition fund and a comprehensive poverty reduction strategy that will draw ten million people out of misery by 2024 and another fifteen million by 2030. We must set ambitious goals in the fight against poverty. These instruments will make fundamental progress in implementing the European Pillar of Social Rights, which we need to strengthen. In this social, economic and ecological, sustainable Europe, to which we aspire to progress cannot benefit only a few. The economy must be at the service of the people. As a result, we also need a different economic policy. We hope that this Presidency will put in place European unemployment insurance. The European Union is a community of shared values. That is why we appreciate your commitment to the defence of the rule of law and its objective of establishing a mechanism linking European Union funds to compliance with our legal order. It is a fundamental issue on which this Parliament has also spoken. I would not want to conclude my speech without referencing a crucial issue: equality. We welcome your commitment to combating the gender pay gap, and we also hope that your Presidency will commit to assessing compliance with the Istanbul Convention to prevent and combat the fight against gender-based violence.

Mr President, Prime Minister, on behalf of the Renew Group, I wanted to welcome the three priorities that are yours, and which are also those of the group, and I think they are widely shared by a majority of this European Parliament. I wanted to emphasize in the time available to me on two particularly important issues of your Presidency. The first issue is carbon neutrality. You have a historic responsibility to convince, by the end of the year, countries that are still resisting on carbon neutrality. You can count on this Parliament to help you, provided of course that it is fair, because not all countries have the same starting point and we want an ecological transition that is fair. It's even the condition of his success. Therefore, you can count on this Parliament and you have that responsibility. We rely on you and your energy. Because, on climate, we are in a new phase. Of course, the Commission's previous objectives have been reiterated by Mr Katainen, but there are new targets that were announced yesterday by the new President of the Commission: to go from less than 40% to less than 55% of greenhouse gas emissions, a Green deal in the first hundred days, a climate law, a climate bank. Today, the political circumstances are gathered and it turns out that you are at the heart of this political meeting. You have the rotating presidency of the European Union and the Renew Group is counting on you, your energy and your convictions to move this issue forward as never before. With regard to the budget dossier, which is also linked to it, I will mention some of the priorities of our group which I think are widely shared by the other groups of the majority of this European Parliament: the maintenance of the budget of the Common Agricultural Policy, which goes hand in hand with the ecological transition of this common agricultural policy. This is the big deal that we have to make with farmers, territories and consumers. Second, the question of the green part of this budget. The European Parliament wants us to be 30% as soon as possible and I think that with the new energy shown yesterday by the President of the Commission, with the new carbon neutrality target, we must, from this MFF [multi-year financial framework], have 30% climate-friendly spending and go beyond the objectives already proposed by the Commission, namely 25%. The last point is own resources. For a lot of reasons, we need to move forward in Europe on our own resources. One issue that can come to fruition is the plastics tax as the European Union's own resource. I know that the Member States are close to an agreement. This is a position that has been defended for a long time by the European Parliament, and you have a responsibility to make it happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2019-07-17.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I welcome the Prime Minister to the European Parliament and to the European scene. Good luck with the Presidency. We’re also happy to hear your priorities, especially the one on the climate because it is very urgent. This is the one and only planet that we have, that we all live on and where we need to make sure that it is also possible to live on it in the future.  While we absolutely share the ambition on the goals – and I think the rest of Europe could learn a lot from Finland in setting very ambitious targets – we all know, of course, that setting ambitious targets is only half – if that – of the job. The real job is in putting very concrete measures into place right now because in order to end up with good and ambitious targets you need to add ‘now’. It’s not enough to just put some numbers for later on into the paper. That’s why I would like to also ask you to push ahead on the reform of the agricultural policy. What we have right now on the table is far from enough to secure biodiversity and climate protection. We need a fresh start here, including with the multiannual financial framework (MFF), where a lot of money is still being put into climate—harmful subsidies. We need a reversion here, we need to make sure that the money that we spend in the European Union is put into places which will help the ecological and social transition, and there we need much more action. You’ve also mentioned the rule of law and we very much agree with that priority because it’s really urgent. Therefore, I would also urge you to take up the issue of the parliamentary report on Hungary, to discuss it in the Council and to also make sure that Parliament, our rapporteurs, are being invited and are being heard by the Council, by the Member States, and that it doesn’t fall under the carpet. Refugees are another big issue. Rescue at sea is right now not happening in the Mediterranean and we cannot allow that people are drowning in the Mediterranean and no one is there to help. I think you can lead by example, making sure that even if there is not an agreement of all Member States – which is a pity, it’s a disgrace – still some Member States can go ahead in order to stop this disgraceful and inhumane situation we have right now at our borders. Lastly, I also want to congratulate Finland for setting a precedent on the issue of transparency as Council. I think in the past we had less interesting precedents being set there, with lobbyism, with sponsorship and I don’t know what. So it’s very good that you are taking a first step and are putting more transparency into lobby meetings. We hope that all the other Member States and the future presidencies can learn from that and that maybe you will also find some space for even more transparency. We would have some ideas if you were interested. Thank you very much and good luck and we’re ready to support you on those issues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2019-07-17.json", "name": "Laura HUHTASAARI", "mepid": "197594", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group. – Mr President, in the face of a massive and illegal avalanche of immigration, the EU has been completely incapable of at least carrying out its basic task of protecting its women and children. The rape of children in Oulu is just one shocking example of this.  Finland's Presidency of the Council of the EU will not respond to Europeans' concerns about uncontrolled immigration, but will exacerbate the situation with permanent migration – this is what Finland's Minister of the Interior Ohisalo is advocating. Rinne's government lives not in reality, but in the utopia of multicultureism. It is naïve to think that a constant increase in development aid would reduce migration from Africa to Europe. Finland should focus on protecting the Baltic Sea and not support people smuggling in the Mediterranean.  The climate issue is important, and this challenge must be met in a sensible way, defending Finnish and European industry. Finland should also demand the strength of the EU's example on the climate issue and propose that we stop this gap between Brussels and Strasbourg. If the French do not agree to this, then let us stay here in Strasbourg. The point is, there's only one place.  In the European Parliament, critical groups in the EU have been excluded by political isolation and demonisation by the d'Hondt method from their seats as Vice-Presidents and Vice-Presidents. In doing so, it is pointless for the EU Parliament to complain about the state of the rule of law in some EU Member States. The EUROPEAN Parliament itself should first follow the spirit of democracy before going out to advise others. It is grotesque to talk about democracy and freedom of expression at the same time, when the EUROPEAN Parliament is precisely destroying both of them from those who disagree. We do not represent ourselves here, we represent the people. No excuse justifies such action, at least totalitarianism is not combated by totalitarianism. The EU should lead by its own example, not as gentlemen.  Does Finland intend to demand that the EU budget be reduced and finland's net membership contribution reduced? Does Finland intend to demand that the EU defend freedom, freedom of expression, democracy and the human rights of Europeans? Is it time for Finland to promote Finland's interests in the EU for the first time and to raise the issue of Finland and not Africa? Incidentally, there are surprisingly few MEPs here.

Mr President, thank you Prime Minister Rinne for your comments. And, of course, all the success with the Finnish Presidency. As chairman of the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets, I will, of course, follow the discussions in the Council on the multianne financial framework with great attention and interest. It is clear that everyone here will have to work quickly and properly to achieve good results.  I would also like to draw your attention to some specific dossiers. In a previous life, we were both members of the Eurogroup, and I fully agree with your sense of urgency around the further completion of the banking union and the whole of the further institutional infrastructure that still needs to be completed around monetary union.  However, I appreciate less of your support for a fiscal instrument for the euro area. If everyone is complying with the stability pact, I do not think there is a need for a specific euro budget. The rapid realisation of the capital markets union, if I understand it, is necessary for the structural health of the euro.  Furthermore, you are firmly committed – as has been clear – to a climate neutral Europe. The transition to a circular economy obviously plays a crucial role in this. We call for a realistic, feasible, affordable and socio-economically responsible climate policy that offers opportunities to all technologies and, indeed, puts technology and research at the heart of it. A gratuitous bid for targets really cannot contribute to the honourable goal of a climate neutral Europe.  Another dossier, which I am calling special attention from the Finnish Presidency, concerns developments in the large technology companies. The debate on this issue focuses very much on whether they pay enough taxes or not. The answer, of course, is no. But that's too limited a discussion. I think that we should absolutely open up this discussion because there is a situation of monopoly, quasi-monopoly, which, in my opinion, threatens the further socio-economic developments in our region and even globally.  Finally, Prime Minister Rinne, I would also like to draw your attention to the three elected Catalan colleagues who, to this day, are unable to take their seats in the Chamber.

I am very pleased that, in the midst of all the great challenges we are now facing, Finland has dared to put climate change and its resolution at the heart of its resolution.  Finland's Presidency comes at a particularly challenging time. We face enormous challenges – a common refugee policy, Brexit, the rise of the extreme right, the mental division of Europe, the defence of the rule of law – at the same time as we have a new Parliament and a new Commission.  But in the midst of all this, the climate must not be left behind. We talk about it a lot, but we still do too little.  We talk mostly about the years and we talk about percentages. Far too little are we talking about the need to resolve climate change in a socially just way. We must be able to implement the ecological reconstruction of our societies, a new climate-resilient society. And that change has to happen in such a way that everyone can keep up. The public must feel that climate solutions are fair so that they are supported and do not become something that divides us even further. This means that the diversity of different regions must be taken into account and people's income levels taken into account. Specific support must be given to those areas where climate solutions mean major structural changes. And if and when subsidies and investment are directed correctly, we can, while solving climate change, creating sustainable economic growth and new climate jobs. The circular economy, among others, is a shining example of this, which was well highlighted by Vice-President Katainen. Finland, for example, has a lot to offer here.  A carbon-neutral EU by 2050 at the latest is also an opportunity if we do it right. And in order for investment and subsidies to be directed correctly, it is important that we take the necessary decisions quickly so that the money is directed correctly. Emission reductions must be tightened up, the control of emissions trading must be improved and increased, and tax solutions must be made possible that steer both consumption and production in a sustainable direction. A just transition fund must be set up. Hopefully, during its Presidency, Finland will strongly support this. Secondly, transparency and transparency. Yesterday, we elected a new President for the Commission, and that was once again a decision taken behind closed doors as a cabinet decision. The european people were unable to influence it through the elections. Hopefully, the Finnish Presidency will increase the visibility of the Council's work, highlight the background to decisions, debates, make the minutes transparent and make all lobbying and influencing as transparent as possible. These decisions, taken behind closed doors, are part of why so many people feel that the EU is undemocratic and alien and distant to themselves and not as their own.

However, I also have an important message for the Finnish Presidency: although the rule of law is an integral part of maintaining the autonomy and independence of the courts, and this must remain a priority, the EU cannot limit the protection of the rule of law to them alone.

The fact that this is one of the priorities of the Presidency allows this House – the European Parliament – but also the Member States, to take a position on this very fundamental issue. On behalf of the Commission, I want to thank you once again for what you have chosen to prioritise. On climate policy, some Members said – quite well – that, just as important as talking about dates or years or percentages, is to devise ways of how we can achieve our ambitious targets. Here the circular economy comes into the picture. Yesterday I was very pleased personally when the newly elected Commission President von der Leyen said that she will propose a new circular economy action plan that will concentrate mostly on the construction sector and the textile sector, which are resource-consuming sectors where we need to improve our actions.  Finally, from the Commission’s perspective, it’s very positive that the Finnish Presidency makes a new experiment, improving the transparency of the work of the Council. From my own personal viewpoint I’ve been wondering what on earth needs to happen for the other European institutions to follow the example of the European Commission, which is by far the most transparent institution in the EU. I must say that I only have very good experiences of this transparency in the European Commission, so I encourage the other European institutions to follow their example.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2019-07-17.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, thank you for this very important opportunity for me to address Parliament on our priorities in the programme.

In Finland, I have spoken several times in which I have said that I would like to answer their question about what you did about climate change, to say that everything that was known and could be done. And that climate change was stopped. The second option is that we did nothing because we were afraid to do anything together.  It is now important that European cooperation should focus on taking leadership in climate policy in a way that will bring global warming on earth to a halt to the 1.5°C that is extremely important from the point of view of mankind as a whole and from the point of view of future generations, and this must be pushed through. I believe, also, that big question of the rule of law is very important for the whole European future. I think that the big issue is that we, together, can make stronger and stronger these rule of law principles when we are developing our cooperation here at European level.

In this context, I call on the Finnish Presidency to actively support the European Parliament's position on the POST-2020 EU budget, which provides for more resources for agriculture and regional development. Secondly, action is important to put the European minimum wage at a level that ensures a decent life for all Europeans. The current differences in this respect between Member States are unacceptable. The European minimum wage is crucial for reducing inequalities between EU citizens, eradicating poverty and ensuring a level playing field.  Thirdly, I am pleased that the rule of law is an important part of the Presidency's agenda. That is why I support the planned actions in this area. However, I would like to draw attention to a prudent approach to linking respect for the rule of law to expenditure from the EU budget.

Finland inherited a number of outstanding current issues from its predecessors, such as Brexit or the need to continue its efforts to make the EU more internationally and further promote the social situation. But, in my opinion, there is a lack of things: a mention of the values that were based on a united Europe. I am referring to the Christian values that the founding fathers have spoken about, and which today's Union forgets to undermine itself. Therefore, in order to achieve a fairer EU, where all citizens can enjoy the benefits of economic and social development, it is important to respect the right world and to return to the roots of a Europe based on the vision of Robert Schuman or Alcide de Gasperi. It is therefore necessary to return to the principles rooted in European identity.

We need a long-term, comprehensive and humane solution to manage migration.  Even though the generally known problems remain, as the debate today will certainly show, we should also note that, in broad terms, the situation of migration flows in the Mediterranean Sea has improved in recent years. According to Frontex data for 2018, approximately 137 000 irregular migrants were registered, having crossed the Mediterranean via one of the three main routes. This year, so far, we are at 36 000 arrivals. Should this trend continue, we would see the number of detected arrivals reduced by approximately 50% in 2019.  Equally important, while of course it is still too high, the number of deaths at sea has decreased. On the central Mediterranean route alone, the decrease is by more than 50%. In 2019, 343 persons are known to have lost their lives while attempting to cross the sea via this route. Any death at sea is one too many, but there is progress. UNHCR estimates that in 2018, the Libyan coast guard rescued or intercepted nearly 15 000 migrants at sea. Even with the deteriorating security situation in Libya this year, the coast guard has continued functioning, rescuing nearly 3 000 persons. These numbers also reflect the important contribution of the EU’s action to reduce fatalities at sea. In particular, in Libya, assistance has been of paramount importance. EUR 91.3 million were granted to support both the Libyan coast guard and the development of Libya’s own maritime rescue coordination centre. Further, Operation Sophia has provided training for a total of 355 coast guard personnel so far and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has provided training on access to the asylum procedure. These are very concrete steps forward.  There is no denying that the humanitarian situation surrounding the search—and—rescue events on the central Mediterranean route is still not satisfactory. Also, stand-offs between Member States continue as a result of NGO vessels picking up migrants at sea. Let me point out that against the overall background, the number of migrants involved in these incidents is quite modest. In 2019, less than 10% of migrants who arrived in Italy had been rescued by NGOs active on the central Mediterranean route. The vast majority of migrants arrived directly in Lampedusa and Sicily or they were rescued by vessels of the Italian authorities. However, in recent weeks, there have been more incidents due to the peak in departures at this time of the year. One example is the Sea-Watch 3. In its case, solutions have been found after one or two weeks or on an ad hoc basis.  The Romanian Presidency has worked on temporary arrangements which would make it possible to manage this type of situation in a more structured manner. In 2019, it presented a report with a series of non-binding elements on temporary arrangements for this embarkation. Our Presidency will continue work on temporary arrangements. An informal meeting of ministers of the interior will take place on Thursday and the situation in the Mediterranean will be highlighted there. Our Minister of the Interior has also invited all her ministerial colleagues to an informal dinner ahead of this meeting to discuss this immediate situation in the Mediterranean. They are temporary in nature until a permanent agreement is found as part of a comprehensive and humane asylum—policy reform. They are open to participation by all Member States on a voluntary basis and provide for a coordination role for the Commission, with support from relevant agencies. This moves towards more balanced responsibility. Solidarity between the Member States is key. The Finnish Presidency will follow up on this work.  The Finnish Presidency will work towards crisis—resilient arrangements. While these arrangements provide some guidance on how to deal with migrants rescued at sea, they do not pronounce on the location where there is embarkment. Human rights—based asylum and migration policies are rooted in international treaties and conventions, cooperation between public authorities and effective control of the EU’s external borders, as well as appropriate and swift asylum procedures that are of a high standard in terms of legal protection. This is by and large a decision for national authorities in application of the relevant provisions under international law. International law obliges all coastal states – in our case, all coastal states around the Mediterranean Sea – to establish search—and—rescue services around their coast. The EU provides support to Member States in the management of their external borders, notably through Frontex operations. Search—and—rescue is not as such the core mandate of these operations, but it is the task they perform in accordance with international law.  The Finnish Presidency will certainly look into ways to unlock the situation. Nobody benefits from this prolonged uncertainty. We need a balanced, comprehensive and humane approach here. Firstly, we need to help the front-liners but, at the same time, we need to understand the challenge as a whole in the secondary movement and integration of migrants, as well as in return policy. The European Union, with its wide range of tools and strong international role, is clearly better equipped to address migration than a single Member State.

There is no doubt that what is happening in the Mediterranean is a cause for high concern. But at the same time, official figures show that flows to the EU have further diminished compared to last year. My dear colleague, the Finnish Minister, has already shown some of these figures. But there is no doubt that we still face a critical situation where too many people embark on dangerous journeys across the sea, risking their lives, in the hope of reaching the EU for protection or better life prospects. This is why the Commission has repeatedly recalled that the EU and its Member States are bound by the duty to render assistance to persons or vessels in distress at sea, which is an obligation under international law – and, may I also add, our moral duty. For their part, NGOs active in the Mediterranean have played an important role in saving lives at sea. In serving this common objective of saving lives, all players should follow the instructions received from the national authority coordinating search and rescue operations. Allow me to say that our four EU operations at sea have helped save nearly 730 000 people at sea since 2015, though we regret that the agreement found by Member States for the continuation of Operation Sophia is far from optimal. When it comes to the question of criminalisation of migrant smuggling, we need to be able to distinguish. Because one thing is actual migrant smuggling, a deliberate profit-making criminal act, and another is providing assistance to people in need. The bottom line here – and I want to underline this – is that no form of genuine assistance to migrants should be criminalised under EU law. However, the essence is that a system whereby people must resort to smugglers cannot be part of a sustainable approach to migration or asylum. The European Union and its Member States must remain resolute to keep on fighting against migrant smugglers and traffickers and not to play into their deadly business model. The most recent atrocious killing of migrants at the Tajoura Detention Centre is a strong reminder of the need to continue to pursue the EU’s efforts to protect the most vulnerable and to put an end to the Libyan arbitrary detention system. The European Union stands ready to support the Libyan authorities to find safe and dignified alternatives for all refugees and other migrants in detention centres close to the conflict area. And let us not forget our overall assistance to Libya, which goes beyond EUR 365 million this year. Thanks to our funding and partnership with IOM and UNHCR, since 2017 more than 40 000 migrants stranded in Libya have been assisted to voluntarily return to their countries of origin while 4 000 refugees have been already evacuated from Libya to Niger or directly to Europe in view of their resettlement. In early July, a further EUR 13 million was granted to UNHCR to reinforce evacuation operations. For these evacuations towards Niger to continue, Member States must speed up resettlements and pledge more resettlement places for persons in Libya or for evacuees in Niger. Despite all these efforts to intervene upstream on the migratory route, we cannot avoid that under certain circumstances, disembarkations take place in Europe. We must be ready to address this situations and, as my dear colleague the Finnish Minister already said, the most fundamental thing is solidarity. While search and rescue remains a national competence, exercised on the basis of international law, the Commission has played a coordinating role to ensure that, when disembarkation takes place in Europe, solidarity is implemented. However, ad hoc solutions cannot be sustainable. We need to put in place predictable temporary arrangements following disembarkation based on a practical and voluntary approach, supported by the EU operationally and financially. They will serve as a bridge until the swift completion of the legislative reform of the Common European Asylum System, which remains a priority for all of us. I welcome the fact that on Monday, Ministers of Foreign Affairs discussed the situation in the Mediterranean. This discussion will be taken forward by the Ministers of External Affairs later today, as my dear colleague Finnish Minister already emphasised. Commissioner Avramopoulos is on his way to Helsinki to discuss with them the way forward to put in place temporary arrangements following disembarkation, built on shared responsibility as part of a broader discussion on the future of the EU asylum and migration policy. The Commission stands ready to continue to provide all the political, technical and financial support that Member States need to address the situation in the Mediterranean. And let us not forget the overarching need to deal with the root causes of migration in parallel with our efforts to help save lives. Africa is a huge challenge – not only for Europe, but also the world. The Juncker Commission has done a lot in this direction. First, through the EU Trust Fund. Second, with the External Investment Plan that has leveraged EUR 37 billion of investments. And third, with the EU-Africa Alliance, through which we aim to create 10 million jobs in Africa in the next five years. Of course, we have to continue. This is the only way to deal with the root causes. We have to create new jobs in Africa, but at the same time, we have to continue our moral duty to save lives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 71, "date": "2019-07-17.json", "name": "Jeroen LENAERS", "mepid": "95074", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, this feels a little bit like Groundhog Day. We’re debating the same issue, in the same way, just on a different day.

On both previous occasions we were told, as we are today, no more ad hoc solutions. And cynically, in the case of Sea—Watch, the Member States kept their word. There was no ad hoc solution – there was no solution at all. And that is a sad reality for an EU that is based on fundamental values and the principle of solidarity. I agree with the Commissioner: saving lives is not only a legal obligation but a moral one, too. But at the same time we have to realise that the current way in which we are working in the Mediterranean, despite all good intentions, is not only helping to save lives but, at the same time, it unfortunately helps the smugglers who put those lives at risk in the first place. This is something we can no longer allow. There is no silver bullet or single solution to all this. We need a holistic approach – an approach that focuses on better protecting our external borders, that focuses on returning migrants who came illegally to Europe and have no right to stay and an approach that focuses on making agreements with third countries of transit and of origin to help us fight those smuggling networks and to help us prevent migrants from entering in overstuffed and unseaworthy vehicles.

I’m not Christian, but I was taught that this is the right thing to do. But now we are actually talking about criminalising saving people. I actually think it’s a criminal act to let somebody drown. Those who are in favour of criminalising it say, ‘these NGOs who are saving people in the Mediterranean are creating a pull factor’. Well, sorry, what they want is a deterrent. They think that if those boats cannot come here, that’s a deterrent. Well, if 35 000 dead bodies on the bottom of the Mediterranean is not a deterrent, then what is? We are talking about small vessels bringing in 40-50 people. I think the Union can handle that. I think that this is not a responsibility that we should put on the shoulders of NGOs or commercial vessels, which are also burdened with this. This is a public responsibility. It is also a collective responsibility for all the EU Member States. It is unacceptable that our Member States still to this day refuse to take their share of the responsibility.

What is applying now is a real confusion and an ammunition given to some on the question of the criminalisation of humanitarian assistance. And let’s be clear: the human instinct, the European instinct, the global instinct to aid people who may be dying, as we have just heard, is one that we need to clarify and we need to accept as one of our values. One year ago exactly I drafted a resolution, as the Commissioner will know, asking exactly what guidelines we would have to prevent humanitarian assistance from being criminalised. Of course, we were told then that there were not many cases. Now we see the cases. With regard to Sea—Watch 3, we see many cases now of criminalisation of humanitarian assistance. So exactly when are these guidelines going to be issued? When are we going to see them?

As we know, it is currently a few states that receive the majority of migrants and who must, in fact, take care of them. We need to reform our asylum policy. The urgent need now is to provide a temporary mechanism to ensure this humanitarian assistance. So here are my questions, Madam Minister, Commissioner: first, how can the European Union act to achieve this humanitarian objective quickly? The second question is that the Frontex agency rescues tens of thousands of people a year at sea, as you have reminded.

Isn't it tremendous that we debated it a hundred times in the last parliamentary term and that we discussed it again in the last plenary session of the last parliamentary term, and that we should discuss it again in this first plenary session of the new mandate of the European Parliament? The reason is simple, and it is that there are undoubtedly aspects in the tragedy in the Mediterranean that escape even the enormous work that you have done in your police station, as is the case with the demographic explosion in Africa and the tortured neighborhood on the southern shore of the Mediterranean. But this Parliament has demanded from the Commission and the Council what depends on Europe. To begin with, to change the look, because it is the absence of legal avenues of access to the European Union that means that anyone who wants to try, fleeing persecution or hunger, has to risk their lives by putting the ourselves in the hands of criminal organisations exploiting people, and particularly the most vulnerable: defenceless women and girls. But we also demand that this response be European, respectful of international humanitarian law, of European law itself — Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which requires solidarity. Because the answer cannot be Malta, it cannot be Italy, it cannot be Greece, nor can it be Spain, but it has to be a common European response. That is why we call on the Council, as soon as possible, to unlock the Treaty, the Dublin Regulation and the asylum package, to meet the European Parliament's mandate to establish legal avenues of access to the European Union, including humanitarian visas. And we call on the Commission to implement as soon as possible the reform of the scandalous Aid Directive, which allows the criminalisation of humanitarian aid. Because we have said many times that humanitarian aid provided at sea by vessels such as Sea-Watch or As Open Arms can in no case be criminalized, nor can such persons be prosecuted or prosecuted or seated on the bench of a court or criminal court. Because saving lives at sea is not a crime; because the work carried out by the cooperators, doctors or captains or captains of those vessels, such as Carola Rackete, can in no case lead them to a criminal trial. Changing the humanitarian gaze, establishing legal avenues for access to the European Union, reforming the Aid Directive so that it is no longer possible to criminalise and making life-saving at sea a crime is the urgent task. Let's not have to debate it a hundred times in this legislature again! Let's get to work as soon as possible! The Finnish Presidency has affirmed its commitment and we take the floor to ensure that, as soon as possible, the Dublin Regulation is unlocked, the Common European Asylum System is completed, the Aid Directive reformed, and we do not have to remain in this psalm, which ritually mourns deaths at sea in every plenary session of the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 98, "date": "2019-07-17.json", "name": "Jan-Christoph OETJEN", "mepid": "197432", "text": "   Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which Our European values require us to help people in distress at sea.

I call for the aiding directive to be amended: those who offer humanitarian aid cannot and must not be criminalised.

Humanitarian action must not be neutral but impartial. It must not be neutral, in the sense of equidistance between the victims and their tormentors, because it must always side with the weak and the persons in danger. It must be impartial because humanitarian action does not distinguish between victims, regardless of their origin, nationality or opinion. Exposure to danger, pursuit or war alone is sufficient to deploy it. The principles thus defined, notably by Henry Dunant, have been codified in the meantime. They are now the norms of international humanitarian law and, consequently, maritime law. Is Mr Salvini solely responsible for the appalling situation in the Mediterranean? No. Those who refuse to take in people saved in the Mediterranean are equally responsible as he is. There are therefore no mitigating circumstances to justify refusing to help those in danger.

There is one cure for this: to absolutely increase development aid in African countries and to implement a broad information campaign on our return and asylum policy. And it is necessary to examine carefully what are the real intentions of the captains of ships receiving from the sea and helping to transfer migrants from Africa to Europe. Can we still talk about sar action or about criminalising aid to illegal immigrants? This is a great task for the authorities involved in the fight against international crime.

And the countries of first arrival, such as Italy, my country, cannot be left alone. The migration crisis must be managed at European level.  The amendment of the Dublin Regulation, the establishment of legal and safe immigration channels, the fight against human traffickers are just some of the essential measures to combine legality and solidarity, and to ensure the protection of children's rights, as laid down in the UN Convention, whose 30th anniversary will be celebrated on 20 November, is the responsibility of all the countries of the Union.

So there’s a moral imperative on us to ensure that we have sensible immigration policies but, in the meantime, the people who are clinging to boats in the Mediterranean cannot be allowed to wait. We have to ensure that we have a new search and rescue mission immediately in the Mediterranean.  The Irish navy was previously involved in Operation Sophia, where it rescued thousands of people.

The Commission considers that humanitarian imperatives have been, and shall continue to be, at the forefront of European Union action. As I said in my opening remarks, the Commission has repeatedly recalled that the EU and its Member States are bound by the duty to render assistance to persons or vessels in distress at sea, and it is an obligation under international law. It is a moral duty. International law is binding on states which are obliged to subject the captains of private, commercial or military vessels to the corresponding duty to render assistance. Saving lives at sea must therefore go hand in hand with addressing the main causes of irregular migration and improving the situation of migrants in Libya and other countries in offering safe alternatives such as resettlement for those entitled to international protection or legal labour migration schemes for those who qualify. I wish also to renew once again my appeal to all Member States to make their contribution to speeding up evacuation of vulnerable migrants and refugees from Libya and Niger. I thank you for your support in building a comprehensive EU response – a holistic EU response – and as I said, the Commission stands ready to continue to provide all the political, technical and financial support that Member States need to address the situation in the Mediterranean, and in particular to reach an agreement on temporary arrangements. The four years since the adoption of the European Agenda on Migration have shown that the situation requires continuous determined action across the full range of the comprehensive approach. The lesson is that united action and joint efforts from Member States and the EU, in close cooperation with partners beyond the EU, has delivered results and is the only way to achieve better management of migration and to ensure that the European Union’s values remain the cornerstone of our migration policy. This is what EU citizens expect from the European Union, from the European institutions. Again, I will quote the President-elect from yesterday: we need solidarity. We all need to help each other and contribute. We need a new way of burden-sharing. And we must make fair cooperation offers to countries of origin and transit which are in the interest of both sides. These are our priorities and we have to start immediately.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 153, "date": "2019-07-17.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, the Presidency is fully aware of the critical importance of providing humanitarian assistance in the Mediterranean Sea and we are committed to working on a solution in collaboration with all stakeholders.  I am grateful for your comments made during this discussion. I listened to them very carefully and I wish to react to them accordingly. As I said previously, we are working to find an arrangement, humane in nature, that brings predictability in accordance with the International Law of the Sea, concerning disembarkation and enables efficient asylum and return policies.  Our Presidency will continue active work on temporary arrangements. Actually the informal meeting of Ministers of the Interior will take place tomorrow in Helsinki and the situation in the Mediterranean will be discussed there. Furthermore, our Minister of the Interior has also invited all her Member State colleagues to an informal dinner no later than today to discuss the immediate situation in the Mediterranean.  It is clear that we need European solutions here. Close and intensive cooperation between institutions and common understanding among the Member States are key for the future migration policy. It is also very important that the new Commission also aims high here. As the new Commission President said yesterday in this very Chamber, we have a common responsibility to save lives at sea. Every life matters. Every life is equally important. It is of the utmost importance that we succeed quickly even if only with a temporary solution. However, we need one that covers all aspects. The EU as a whole, not to mention the migrants themselves, do not deserve that this situation stays unresolved.  At the same time, we will continue working on the reform of the Common European Asylum System to provide a permanent and humane solution to situations, such as the ones mentioned, in the future. I remain confident that, thanks to all our efforts, we can take an important step forward towards this goal. Thank you very much again for your contributions and for your attention.

These ‘humanitarian’ entrepreneurs are subject to no proper regulation and basically engage in a catch-as-catch-can game with approaching migrant boats. The situation is not sustainable for political, security, economic and social reasons. Yet Europe still does not have a functioning policy to process legal migration, Dublin II arrangements remain unfair and outdated, Schengen procedures could soon be placed under new pressure and the feeding of false hopes to arriving migrants is serving to strengthen the reach of people traffickers.

Ill health caused by air pollution costs the economy billions of euros in lost working days and causes 400 000 premature deaths per year in Europe alone. That is why air quality has been, and is, an extremely important issue for the Council. The EU has for some time already had a solid legal framework in place that includes the Ambient Air Quality Directives and is the basis for measures taken at national, regional and local levels. Low emission zones and incentives for cleaner transportation modes have been successfully implemented in different cities and regions in Europe with encouraging results. The data show that air quality has improved across Europe over the past decades, in particular in urban areas, as emissions of many pollutants have been successfully reduced.  In this context, let me highlight the decisive actions taken by the co—legislators over the last few months to strengthen the array of EU legislative instruments in this area even more. I think we can look with satisfaction at the results achieved with the outgoing Parliament on a number of new legislative measures that provide, directly and indirectly, important contributions to cleaner air. The Clean Vehicles Directive promotes the market uptake of zero and low-emission vehicles by introducing binding minimum targets for their use in public procurement in each Member State. These measures will play a key role in cutting greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions and will also contribute – to an important extent – to achieving the EU’s climate commitments under the Paris Agreement.  The directive overhauling electronic tolling systems in the EU updates the technical interoperability requirements for such systems. It will create a system of exchange of information to reach foreign drivers who have not paid their road charges and fees with a view to enforcing the respect of road tolls more efficiently. At this stage it also covers charges for access to urban areas, but not complete bans or limitations to certain types of vehicles. However, the review clause of the directive requests that, by 2023, the Commission evaluates the extension of the directive to cover low emission zones, restricted access zones and other urban vehicle access regulation schemes.  Finally, let me also mention the recently adapted climate legislation to reduce CO2 emissions from cars, vans and heavy—duty vehicles that will accelerate the uptake of cleaner technologies such as zero and low-emission vehicles, thereby also helping to reduce air pollution in our cities.  The Finnish Presidency attaches great importance to the protection of air quality and to improving the environmental performance of vehicles. In this context, the Presidency considers that it’s crucial to continue the mandatory application of real driving emissions test procedures on the road and not to rely solely on test procedures in laboratory conditions. To reach that goal, the Parliament and the Council need to come to an agreement on conformity factors. As you know, the devices we use to measure real driving emissions have technical uncertainties. Conformity factors take account of these uncertainties.  We hope to reach a swift agreement with Parliament on the new Real Driving Emissions (RDE) proposal in order to ensure legal certainty for all parties involved. It is of the utmost importance to ensure the implementation of EU air quality standards by all stakeholders, an issue that is closely followed by the Commission. We know that there are still compliance gaps for some key pollutants. The Council is therefore looking forward to the completion of the Commission’s fitness check of the Ambient Air Quality Directives, which it will examine with great interest as soon as available.  Good air quality, especially in cities, has a positive impact on the quality of life for each of us. A number of cities in the EU still exceeded the limit values of the National Emission Ceilings Directive. Thus we all have to work nationally to secure better health for our citizens. The strong link between air quality and climate change means that similar measures can help to tackle both. For example, the transport sector is the biggest source of emissions of black carbon that accelerates the warming of the Arctic region. This is important to keep in mind in the EU discussions as well. Thank you very much for your attention.

The fact that air pollution causes over 400 000 premature deaths every year is unacceptable. We have to act, to the benefit of our citizens. And that is precisely what this Commission has been doing this mandate – and we have done so resolutely. Our actions have been based on three main pillars. First: supporting our Member States in reaching EU air quality standards. We have made EU funding available under various financial streams and the Member States have successfully used that funding to address the air quality challenge. To cite just one figure: in the current programming period 2014-2020, almost EUR two billion have been directly allocated to air quality measures under the European Structural and Investment Funds. Second point: improving how we regulate emissions at their source. Prominent examples for this are the Directive regulating medium combustion plants and the package of Real Driving Emissions rules. Third and final: taking decisive enforcement action when and where exceedances of air quality limit values persist. The Commission is currently pursuing 30 infringement procedures against 20 Member States for exceedances of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide or sulphur dioxide limit values. For two cases already, the Court of Justice has confirmed that Member States need to accelerate their efforts to improve air quality further. The Commission is doing its part, and will continue to do so as the measures taken so far have resulted in some improvements. But we also need to remember what that part is. Our legislation on ambient air sets limit values on air pollution, and an obligation to keep exceedance periods as short as possible, and the Commission steps in when and where this is not the case. But the choice of measures lies with Member States. It is up to their authorities, across levels of governance, being national or local, to define which coordinated measures they take to meet the agreed limit values. When the Commission takes infringement action against Member States, the goal is not to ensure that one measure or the other is implemented – be it a specific clean air zone, support for renewing the fleet, replacing old boilers in households, or any other measure. The goal is, first and foremost, to speed up efforts in those Member States to reach compliance with EU legislation, and to keep any period of exceedance as short as possible. Beyond legislation and infringements, we support cities in a number of ways to make their air cleaner. When it comes to urban mobility, for example, we are working with national and local authorities to identify best practices on urban vehicle access regulation schemes such as low-emission zones and traffic restriction measures, but also to foster consistency in line with single market principles and ensure information on such access regulations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 160, "date": "2019-07-17.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which Health is our greatest asset, and that is why it is certainly our common goal to reduce air pollutants. We have already achieved a great deal, and this should not be forgotten in all discussions. On the subject of NOx, for example, since the 1990s, we have halved pollutant emissions through European Union measures and national measures, in other words, we have also halved the health burden on citizens. In the 1990s, there were very frequent ozone alarms in Central Europe. Ozone is produced by solar radiation and nitrogen oxides. Solar radiation has increased, but nitrogen oxides have decreased. That is why we have less ozone alarms. That is why it is not a cause for panic, but it is reason to act and to continue along this path. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believe that driving bans on diesel vehicles are not a good solution, because firstly, it is a burden for many citizens who depend on the car and cannot buy a completely low-emission car so quickly. I also think it is difficult. In my country, for example, there is a threat to close a motorway that runs through the middle of the Ruhr region– a very large area of five million inhabitants. When people drive through the residential areas, health is certainly not well served. That is why we need to address the problem at source. That is exactly what the Commissioner said, and I would like to support that. A great deal has been done, but we must also make the car industry more accountable. We must offer diesel drivers retrofitting if they are affected by the emissions manipulations. Personally, I am also in favour of a new level of Euro 7. However, we must also look at other sources, such as shipping. President Ursula von der Leyen spoke about this in relation to CO2, but we must also take greater responsibility for shipping in the case of other pollutants. In German said, ships often burn the last dirt and have virtually no exhaust gas cleaning.

Mr President! Thanks for the introductions to this topic. For us in the Socialist Group, clean air in Europe is a huge top priority. It is important for the health of our citizens to be able to breathe clean air.  I fully agree with both the Commission and the Council that much has been done in recent years. But that despite this, we have a lot of problems around Europe. For example, in Madrid and Madrid Central, which have had a challenge with their air quality and the environmental zones set up there. The air in Madrid is not clean and they want to be able to do something about it. So we see it in many parts of Europe that citizens cannot breathe proper air. We need to do more. We need to do more! The Member States have a huge responsibility because it is you who have to ensure that we comply with the rules we have. The European Commission also has a huge responsibility. In the last term of office, we had the whole 'Dieselgate' scandal that we were working on and we have got good legislation in place, but it has not yet come into force. It won't do it until next year! And that's only a quarter, I think, of the cars that drive illegally as a result of the 'Dieselgate' scandal, which has been withdrawn from the market, so three-quarters are still driving out there and polluting. That is simply not good enough! Our air needs to be cleaner. And why should it? Yes, as Peter Liese also said, it should, because it is about our health. People are dying from this. And the people who don't die get a worse quality of life. So it takes a lot more. I would like the old European Commission to ensure that the new European Commission is told that it is a priority for us in the European Parliament that something more needs to be done.  We must have looked after our toolbox. Can we, for example, allow Member States to ban diesel cars and petrol cars if they need it in order to create cleaner air and health? The aim is to create opportunities to do more in this area. This could be one of the options. I think we should help the citizens of Madrid and all sorts of other places to ensure that they can have clean air. They don't have that today.

Countless more are becoming sick, and the cost to our health services and businesses runs into billions. There are some in this Chamber who deny that this is a European issue and say that the EU should not tell Member States what to do, but air pollution does not respect national borders.

For me, as a newly elected Member of Parliament, after all the political opinions, including from the Commission and the Council, the impression has finally been confirmed: not only in the media, but also in the EU institutions, there is scaremongering rather than competence on the subject of the environment and energy. CO2, by the way, is not an air pollutant, and how you intend to measure the alleged figures for premature deaths remains a scientific mystery to me.  Like a bazaar of green-painted idiots, haggling is done. Here a little less limit value, there a new climate tax. Instead of informing citizens, political propaganda is being carried out with climate and air pollution horror scenarios, which unfortunately catch the people of many. The Air Quality and Clean Air Directive of May 2008 created the conditions for environmental zones with driving bans. There are currently 58 of these environmental zones in Germany alone. Good-faith citizens who had relied on politics and the procedures under the rule of law were deceived. After all, anyone who bought a diesel car that met the standards not so long ago must now find out that it was expropriated by the state. Because he now owns a worthless car that is no longer allowed to drive in many cities. Thanks to innovative diesel technology, modern filters and other protective devices, the air in Europe is getting better and better. People are living longer and longer. For 20 years, particulate matter pollution and nitrogen dioxide pollution have been continuously reduced. The latest data from the German Federal Environment Agency show that in 2018, not a single one of the 536 measuring points in Germany exceeded the annual mean value for particulate matter of 40 micrograms per cubic meter. In the Erfurt environmental zone, for example, the limit value for particulate matter has not been exceeded in succession since 2012.  Must the end of humanity now be postponed? Is saving the world in the water? No! If, as envisaged, the fine dust limits are halved, then almost overnight Germany, and probably as much of Europe, will be transformed into a no-driving zone, and we are thus coming quite close to the green wish of turning our country into a nation of donkey carts and cyclists.

At the same time, these zones face various difficulties that threaten their continued existence. One of them is that they are becoming the subject of political struggle. It happens that the newly elected mayor stops collecting fines for violations of the rules of clean zones, and his decision is subsequently challenged in court, which overturns his decision and orders the re-collection of these fines. For air quality, such an outcome is undoubtedly a win, but if these legal battles were to be repeated, the fate of these zones could be highly uncertain. A weakness of the zones is that they are often politically contentious and therefore vulnerable. The systemic solution should consist, on the one hand, of tightening EU air protection legislation and, on the other, of ensuring that car manufacturers bring their vehicles into line with existing emission regulations.

It was really very helpful for putting the issue of clean air on the agenda. No doubt we all recognise that it is one of the most important environment and health challenges of our time, and our discussion today has shown that there are multiple challenges ahead of us, no doubt also measures need to be adopted at regional and local level to deal with air quality issues. But also you know well that the European Commission cannot force any specific measures, but at the same time, our contribution to the Sibiu Summit focuses on this. We have stressed the urgency of continuing our efforts in the years ahead, and our citizens expect that the air we breathe every day is of good quality and does not leave us at the risk of harm, and all of us also recognise that they expect from us as institutions – the European Parliament, the European Commission, Member States and also local authorities – to solve this problem, to find innovative ways to reduce the problem. And I strongly believe that only together we can find ways to reduce the consequences of these problems, because it’s one of the major challenges of our time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 211, "date": "2019-07-17.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, thank you so much for your contributions during these discussions: they are all highly valuable. Let me conclude by recalling that improving air quality means to address a number of factors that are relevant in this respect, and it requires common efforts to strive for this objective by putting in place a variety of measures at European, national, regional and local level. The infringement procedures recently opened by the Commission against several Member States for breach of EU air quality legislation are a testimony of the importance of monitoring whether EU law in the area is being properly enforced. Indeed, we need to act on three levels: proper implementation of EU legislation; national rules and regulations; and, last but not least, provisions by cities and local communities, which makes this all very concrete to our citizens in Madrid, in Helsinki, in Strasbourg, and in all of our cities in Europe. In this way we will be able to ensure a better protection of the health of European citizens and the environment. Ladies and gentlemen, the Presidency is putting its best efforts to achieve progress in these areas, and together with Member States and the EU institutions, we need to decisively pursue EU-wide efforts to foster low-emission mobility. I would like to conclude by underlining the importance that we attach to sustainability, the implementation of the UN 2030 agenda for sustainable development, in line with the motto of our Presidency, which is: ‘sustainable Europe, sustainable future’.
