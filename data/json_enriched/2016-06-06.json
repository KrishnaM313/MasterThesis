We have come a long away in fighting this serious disease. However, if we are to succeed in ending the AIDS epidemic by 2030, we must speed up and beef up our efforts to prevent HIV/AIDS, to give everybody a chance of early diagnosis and to provide appropriate treatment to all those who need it.  The Commission strongly welcomes the United Nations High-Level meeting on HIV/AIDS to be held in June in New York, and supports the calls for a faster response and renewed commitment. AIDS continues to strongly affect sub-Saharan Africa. Two out of three people who become infected live there. Young girls are particularly at risk and, right here in our continent, in eastern Europe, HIV infections are still on the rise. The European Union has a role to play in bringing the AIDS epidemic to an end at home, in our neighbourhood and in other partner countries, showing solidarity and providing additional support to those countries that need it most – low income ones in particular. The EU channels its support to AIDS prevention and treatment through the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The Fund has helped to provide HIV treatment to over eight million people. The EU and its Member States collectively provide half of the Global Fund resources: more than EUR 1.5 billion has already been contributed from the European Union budget. There are plans to pledge another EUR 470 million for the 2017—2019 period at the pledging conference in September. The Sustainable Development Goals of last year mark a welcome shift from a focus on diseases to a more integrated approach to addressing people’s health needs.  If we want to end AIDS and many other diseases, we must help third countries develop the capacity to provide basic healthcare, clean water and sanitation to all their citizens. This needs to be a collaborative effort. Domestic funding for this purpose, particularly in middle-income countries, also needs to be increased. In the EU we have made good progress: they have in particular eliminated mother-to-child transmission, and thus exposure of children to HIV/AIDS.  New infections are declining. Treatment coverage and access to care is high. A rather significant outstanding challenge remains: over 300 000 people in the EU need lifelong treatment; 30 000 people still get infected every year. Even so, HIV can be prevented. HIV/AIDS treatment costs billions of euros. The Commission works closely with Member States and civil society to strengthen prevention, improve testing and support universal access to treatment and care. We must reach out in particular to eastern Europe and Central Asia, where the epidemic is still on the rise. Again, this needs to be a collaborative effort.

The New Secretary-General of the United Nations report, \"Accelerating the Response to the End of the AIDS Epidemic\", warns us of the major benefits gained over the past 15 years in the fight against this threat to the health of the population, which could be lost if no action were taken over the next five years. The report also urges States to react by increasing investment and strengthening actions, especially in the prevention zone. I recall that since the beginning of the epidemic, almost 71 million people have been infected with HIV, half of whom have died over the years from failure to detect in time, lack of treatment or adequate care. Encouraging progress has been made, especially after 2011. Access to antiretroviral treatment for more than 15 million people infected with HIV has been ensured, leading to a significant increase in life expectancy, a decrease in death, and access to treatments. However, the impact of social factors such as poverty, inequality and discrimination, especially among the vulnerable population, should not be neglected. And when I say 'vulnerable population' I mean the categories of people who should no longer suffer from discrimination and, of course, first of all, I mean children. Statistics show that in the period 2000-2014, their number decreased, but there are still discrepancies, especially in developing countries. I believe that we need to have a much more ambitious plan of measures, we need to target vulnerable groups of the population, we need to create a social protection tool, we need to ensure that PEOPLE infected with HIV have access to lifelong treatment and adequate medical care.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Enrique GUERRERO SALOM", "mepid": "96768", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, Commissioner, the United Nations conference will take note of the many progress that has been made in this area over the past fifteen years: advances in information that have led to better disease prevention, medical and pharmacological advances in responding to it, greater activation of civil society and health systems that have responded in a coordinated manner to this infection , which has taken so many millions of people ahead of the world.  But more important than the progress we have made is the commitment to continue fighting this disease that is still suffering from forty million people in the world, for which more than one million people died in 2015, from which many of their girls and women continue to become infected in different parts of the world and for which Africa — the continent of poverty and also the continent of pain — is losing many of its girls and women. Therefore, what is important are the commitments we have for the future.

The encouraging results since the launch of the Global Fund in 2002 make a clear case for the continuation of the fight against these diseases.  It is to be hoped that not only the Commission, but also all the Member States of the European Union and all the industrialised countries, will fully understand the priorities for global public health.

But supporting only in words is useless. To make it real support, we should rethly our drug development model to put it at the service of people and not the interests of large pharmaceutical companies. We must be consistent and not undermine access to medicines from the people of developing countries through trade agreements with severe intellectual property clauses that are reproduced over and over again, and we continue on that path. And patent protection is why newer and more effective medicines are not available to 95% of people affected by AIDS living in the global South. It's not my data, it's United Nations data.

In these areas, access to life-saving antiretroviral treatment must be speeded up, because coverage reaches less than a third of the population that currently needs it. There are 35 countries that contribute to 90% of HIV infections worldwide. Of these, 23 are Africans. But we also have a problem in Europe; in Italy, which is in twelfth place in Europe for new diagnoses, there is clearly a problem. In 2014, 3 695 new HIV diagnoses were detected, or 6.1 cases per 100 000 in terms of incidence. Therefore, it is essential to initiate special preventive measures but also to activate new investment lines. It must be borne in mind that in low- and middle-income countries the price of medicines can reach up to 80 times the international reference price. In these countries there is very little availability in the public sector, while there is a great deal of availability in the private sector, where prices are much higher, thus making themselves inaccessible to huge slices of the population. We have a problem with access to medicines, to medicines, in Africa and, at the same time, we have a problem of over-medicine in rich countries. Above all, we have an excess of concentration in the industrial production of medicines, which is all in the hands of very few pharmaceutical companies that have the power to decide on price, the power to lay down rules for intellectual property rights and the power to promote incremental innovations rather than real research.

Nearly forty million people remain infected, and twenty-two million of them are still unable to access treatment. Here in Parliament we are opening up a debate on access to medicines and, of course, we must incorporate this aspect into the whole policy of development cooperation.

When it comes to HIV, early diagnosis and timely treatment are crucial, but education and prevention are even more important. Values-based education and responsible behaviour will help make our children responsible young people, so it needs to be invested in. Responsible behaviour is even more important to talk about today as we face worrying trends that show how more children and young people aged 10-19 are contracting HIV. To date, more than 30 million people have died from HIV, but international experts confirm that AIDS could disappear as a threat to public health by 2030 when at least 90% of people infected with HIV would be diagnosed in a timely way and start antiretroviral treatment. In order to meet this goal, it is necessary to reach the most vulnerable and the poorest. 22 million people still don't have access to the treatment, and most don't even know they're infected. Nearly 26 million people are estimated to be infected with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. Religious organizations play a major role in hiv testing and treatment, especially in this part of the world, and international Caritas has taken a leading role in promoting care for people affected by HIV.  Two months ago, Caritas and religious organizations also issued guidelines for eradicating HIV in children by 2020. Although the number of patients and child mortality decreased in recent years, and more than 70% of infected pregnant women received treatment so that the virus would not be transmitted to children, the treatment is available only for 820 thousand children out of 2.6 million who are infected with HIV.

The problem is also that, for example, in the most affected countries of Africa, only half of children exposed to HIV undergo diagnostic screening after birth. More than a quarter of all care for people suffering from HIV and AIDS worldwide is provided by Catholic health institutions. They see their work as a moral obligation because they believe that every human life, even the one not yet born, is worthy of protection. For example, a team of doctors and healthcare professionals from the Slovak University of St. Elizabeth from Bratislava has long led health projects in Africa and Asia dedicated to children with HIV and their mothers. However, dialogue between these organisations and the EU is hampered by dogma about ending pregnancy as a solution to any political or health problem.

I would make one point in this debate and it is this: I think we have become complacent in the European Union on the prevalence of AIDS. In my own country the numbers last year were at the highest level of new cases for the past five years. At least one-third of people in Ireland are not even aware that they are prone to obtain the virus and are possible carriers of the virus.

That is why we need collective action and solidarity with the vulnerable living among us and those living in countries that cannot afford universal healthcare coverage. The Commission will continue to support EU action to address HIV within the EU, in the neighbouring countries and across the world, using all the tools at its disposal.

Mr President, I would first like to thank the other political groups for the excellent cooperation we have had, as well as Commissioner Andriukaitis, for being here today to discuss the coherence of the Union's policies for development (CPD). CPD is a very important, complex and little-known subject. It is about the consistency of all our policies, so it is tempting to want to deal with everything. It seems to me that Parliament's report did not give in to this temptation and tried to focus on a few key elements, both to move the debate forward and to contribute to the implementation of the CPD. Within the Union, coherence is very important: the different institutions want to be coherent with each other; we also want our policies to be consistent with each other. The most difficult question is how to implement this coherence in the service of development so as not to undo on the one hand what we do on the other.  The Commission's 2015 report is positive: there has been considerable progress, which must, of course, be both continued and strengthened. In Parliament's resolution, we focused on two key points. First, there is the interaction between the CPD and the development agenda by 2030. While other international actors have already begun a thorough reflection on the transformation of the CPD into 'coherence of policies in the service of sustainable development', the European Union has yet to adopt a clear position on this point. The drafting of this report and the workshop we organised were an opportunity for Parliament to launch this process of reflection. The fact that the European Commission is embarking on a similar process could call into question the very principle of the CPD and the biennial report, with a broader perspective.  Designing the CPD as part of the 2030 development agenda also means rethinking global development goals to evade this donor-receiver concept and move towards goals that are applicable to all.  The CPD remains an unknown concept at the international level. We will not be able to integrate the CPD into the Sustainable Development Goals if the other key players in development - the United States, Japan, the BRICS - do not participate in this effort. The Union has a key role to play. It must continue to promote the universalization of the CPD concept to our partners. The European Parliament must be involved in this process, as it is now an important player in the CPD.  The second crucial element in this year's report is to find ways to improve the use and effectiveness of CPD instruments. I think it is important to stress that the implementation of the CPD remains laborious, but we must not forget that it is a complex exercise.  I did not call for the creation of new instruments for the CPD, because the necessary instruments already exist. On the other hand, we must find a way to use these tools in the most consistent and effective way possible. This requires clear and indisputable responsibilities for the implementation of the CPD. The only way to give the CPD a decisive boost is to put it on the agenda of an EU summit. I know the idea can make you smile, but a few years ago there was also a smile on the idea of organising a European defence summit. If we really want to be serious about the progress of the CPD, it must be discussed at the highest political level. An EU summit would also create an inter-institutional and Member State-level thought process. This summit would provide clear guidance on how to operationalize the CPD. It must be able to extract itself from the \"development\" bubble in order to exist in other areas. It's not about development, it's about coordinating all the other policies for development. So we have to think differently about the CPD.  Since the 2013 report, new instruments have been created. I am thinking in particular of the contribution of the European Union delegations to the biennial report. This exercise is a positive development, which should be extended to all delegations. Moreover, in view of the extremely important role that EU heads of delegations can play in implementing the CPD on the ground, this issue should be put on the agenda of the annual meeting of heads of delegations in Brussels. Delegations have a comprehensive view of EU policies in a given country and can therefore enable us to identify inconsistencies and how to correct them.  Of course, I cannot mention here all the instruments of the CPD and how to improve them. We still have a lot of progress to make in terms of impact studies, for example, which are not conducted systematically. But I also want to say that some instruments work, and even very well. I am thinking in particular of joint programming, which includes not only all the activities of the Union but also the activities of the Member States, to ensure greater coherence.  Of course, I cannot address all the priority areas of action contained in the report. Should the CPD's priorities be changed, or should others be added? I think we will be able to answer that question once we have started the process of reflection as part of the implementation of the development agenda by 2030. Finally, I would like to add that I wanted to focus this year on the CPD in the Union's foreign policy. The refugee crisis, the destabilization facing the Union in its neighbourhood, have called into question its very foundations, including solidarity and free movement. External action is the area on which the CPD must focus. Stabilizing our neighbourhood must therefore be a top priority. We have the comprehensive approach, which is an ideal instrument for the CPD, and this approach should be further strengthened with the adoption of the comprehensive strategy this month. We must make this instrument the hallmark of the European Union's external action.  The comprehensive approach, when properly implemented, should also enable us to prevent crises and ensure an effective transition from a military or civilian operation to the implementation of other instruments to continue progress on the ground. The example of the Sahel speaks for itself. When the Union mobilises all its tools in a region facing poverty, internal conflict and radicalisation, it can make a difference.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 29, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, policy coherence for development is, indeed, of fundamental importance in our joint efforts to promote and support global sustainable development. Ensuring that all European Union policies contribute to our shared development objective is not only common sense but also a necessity. In the Commission we have put policy coherence at the heart of our work, both in terms of ensuring coherence of our general policies and actions and in making sure that our policies indeed support our development cooperation objectives. But we cannot do this alone: we need to join forces. It is a shared responsibility. It is very encouraging to see this Parliament’s strong interest in and support for policy coherence for development, as manifested by this debate. Let me thank the rapporteur, Mr Preda, for steering the preparation of the report, which we welcome. The European Parliament has a key role to play in making policy coherence for development a success. You have consistently underlined the importance of the topic, including by establishing the post of standing rapporteur and by issuing several important resolutions. This debate is both useful and very timely. It provides an important contribution not only in our daily business of implementing policy coherence for development but more importantly for the implementation of the watershed 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The universal character of the 2030 Agenda marks a fundamental change of paradigm. It calls for a whole-of-government approach and for development sensitivity in policy making across a very broad range of inter-connected sectors. The most important challenge for all of us in this room and well beyond is to make it happen, putting all means at our disposal to good use. This is what we are currently working on in the context of the revision of the European Consensus on Development. A public consultation was launched last week and will be open until 21 August. We count very strongly on your input and support. Despite some critical remarks, which we note and also appreciate, I welcome the overall positive assessment by this House of the Commission’s work on policy coherence for development (PCD). We have made significant progress over the last years. Let me give you some examples of where our work has successfully influenced political decision making in favour of development objectives. First, we have placed PCD firmly as a part of impact assessments within the Better Regulation framework. It is still early days, but the systematic development check, through development specific guidelines and a toolbox for assessing potential impacts when elaborating new initiatives, has the potential to be a game changer. We have introduced country-by-country reporting, increasing transparency in extractive industries. The last common agricultural policy reform of 2013 was mindful of potential trade distortions vis-à-vis developing countries. And, finally, the Commission communication on ‘Trade for All’, from October 2015, was drafted with significant pro-development considerations as guiding principles. In short, we are making progress and this is confirmed by the 2015 PCD report and by your report today. We should be encouraged by that. We should continue to step up our joint efforts to make full use of policy coherence for development as a tool for implementing the 2030 Agenda and guaranteeing the shared prosperity of the European Union and our partner countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 30, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Lola SÁNCHEZ CALDENTEY", "mepid": "125035", "text": "  draftser of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. – Mr President, the coherence of policies beyond a principle set out in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and in the United Nations' own sustainable development objectives is pure common sense. Consistency must or should be the cornerstone of our entire foreign policy. Some Members of this House have their mouths filled by talking about resource efficiency and efficiency, but, ladies and gentlemen, policy coherence is a key issue for efficiency. If we are not consistent in our external action, we are wasting money for official development aid and also deceiving citizens who, with their taxes, finance these aids. Because while we are allocating development aid, the rest of our policies, especially trade, continue to impoverish the countries of the south. And so, what we give with one hand we take away with the other. It's a totally cynical and hypocritical posture. It is now, once the SDGs have been approved, that it is time to move from policy to action. The universal nature of the new development framework implies that we, the developed countries, place an emphasis on policy coherence. It is time to be ambitious, to go beyond the beautiful words and to bet on truly effective and above all binding measures, such as betting on international taxation, combating austerity policies and privatizations of public services, demanding civil and criminal liability from large companies and ending their unbearable impunity, reformulating trade and investment policy , putting it at the service of people, or ensuring access to medicines as a universal and fundamental right. This is a very important opportunity for the European Parliament to become aware of the principle of policy coherence for development and to call for the urgency of effective and, as I said, binding measures to ensure the full implementation of Article 208 which, ladies and gentlemen, we have given ourselves and are not complying with.

He has already stressed, I will reiterate, that our development cooperation is indeed needed to be effective, the coherence of all EU policies in the interest of sustainable development is needed. And indeed a lot has been done in this area, for example as far as the alignment of our agricultural policy is concerned. The fact is that our trade policy must also be aligned, but I would not share such critical tones as my colleague mentioned before me.  It seems to me that free trade is one key growth generator for developing countries. That the benefits of free trade are more numerous, and the most obvious is the generation of economic growth through increased commercial opportunities and investments and increasing the productive base through the development of the private sector. And I think that should also be taken into account.  In any case, coherence between the European Union's policies and development goals is a key element, and we all agree, to achieve the new 2030 agenda for sustainable development and we must not fall into the trap of giving one hand in the form of development aid and taking the other through some other policies. That's right. I might point out the issue of illicit financial flows and perhaps we should also work a little harder in this area, especially in the framework and in the form of new Panama papers that have been published.  So that's where we need some new mechanisms, too.

I think it is perfectly logical for the rapporteur to choose to make a link between the foreign aid we are funding and the need for better coordination of migration, not least because, if we did not have the uncontrolled migration, there would be much more money to actually help those people in need who do not manage to get to Europe. But what I always wonder about when I read these reports is that, without fleshing out the content, common solutions are being called for. Surely the rapporteur must have an opinion on what the common solution should be. A solution is not good simply because it is common! And I have to say that if I look around among the 28 countries today, the only thing – or at least the one that can garner the greatest support – seems to be a push model, focusing more on helping those people in the neighbourhoods who are genuinely in physical distress, who cannot afford to bribe people smugglers who do not want to risk their lives across the Mediterranean. than focusing on those who have come to Europe by that route.

Mr President, the European Parliament's Development Committee is presenting its third report today on policy coherence for development. There is no need to repeat the same observations, the same analyses and the same proposals, all of which have already been said and repeated. In fact, Cristian Preda, whom I congratulate, has resisted this temptation. What is important is to learn from them, which should guide us in action. To that end, I have tabled an oral amendment which, if implemented, would allow the President of the Commission to decide in the event that two or more commission departments fail to agree on the way forward.  It can be argued that the Commission's inter-service meetings are there to resolve this kind of conflict; the question is what should be done in the event of an insurmountable divergence. From my point of view, arbitration must be provided at a higher hierarchical level: in this case, the possibility should be provided for the President of the Commission to assume full political responsibility on the main directions. It could thus decide under the commitments made by the European Union in the context of policy coherence in the service of development. I would like to stress the importance of this oral amendment. Indeed, not to retain it or, if necessary, to oppose it, would be to question a provision that the European Parliament had already voted by its vast majority in my own report on the coherence of policies in the service of development discussed here in plenary in 2013.

There are 1.5 billion people in this world who are still living in poverty, who are deprived in ways that we in the West can only imagine. We have a human duty to do what we can to help, but to me this report is far from ideal in terms of identifying the problems at European Union level, and also in terms of seeking what solutions we should adopt.  The discussion of migration and development seems to spectacularly fail to take into account the way that the European Union has, in my view, mismanaged the refugee crisis from start to finish. The problems that arose are problems which could reasonably have been foreseen at the time, and which many of us did in fact foresee and said on the record, in this place, at the time.  It seems to me that this report is pushing towards greater EU, more EU control. For example, it mentions common asylum and immigration policy. I just wonder, if people in the United Kingdom actually knew that there were moves in this place towards a common asylum and immigration policy, how that would impact on their views on 23 June? Where I do agree with the report is to say that aid alone is not sufficient, because a lot of assisting development in developing countries is actually about developing through trade. It is actually about eliminating tariff barriers of which, sadly, we still all too often have too many at EU level. It is about bringing down tariff barriers and it is about helping countries through free and fair trade.  I would take issue as well with the report in its mention of a financial transaction tax. I see that as something that is hugely unconnected to the development issue and something which again would go down very badly indeed within the United Kingdom. So I would say that whilst I agree with the principle of the human duty that we have, this report has spectacularly failed to achieve what it should have achieved.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, development means combining capital and the work of men. Development is done by men, but is not decreed. Twenty years of practice in Africa have taught me this, because training and the transfer of know-how must go hand in hand with the transfer of capital: it takes time and programming. Real development is organized, planned and financed, for a long-term return on investment that does not meet the law of the market and generalized competition, which, for its part, has only short-term prospects and therefore does not invest in human capital.  Europe and Africa have in common that they have been victims of austerity imposed by debt and thus by finance, which has taken over the real economy, the human economy that makes development: Africa by the IMF, in the context of the debt crisis of the 1980s, and Europe, in that of the sovereign debt crisis that followed the banking crisis of 2007-2008.  We should remember the Jewish Jubilee, which handed over debts every 50 years to regain the human sense of the economy. To do this, we would have to get out of our slogans of the single market, which is really unique in an almost programmed bankruptcy.  I propose a real \"New Deal\" for Europe and Africa, using the resources of the Central Bank not to buy debts, but to create, this time, new wealth.  A trillion invested in southern Europe, because even though the balance of payments accounts are currently balanced, this has been done by the destruction of wealth as a result of austerity.

Many of the speakers here are receiving the subject we are talking about, only in humanitarian terms - humanitarian and charitable aid. However, this is a matter of civilisation. We live in a time of great breakthrough. Behind us is the globalisation of the exploitation of one another, that is, the globalisation of poverty. We must set ourselves a very important objective, that is, the globalisation of prosperity. The globalisation of prosperity is not only a blank slogan, or such a humane treatment of those who are poorer than us, but it is also a purely economic and economic challenge. The world will not be able to function long being divided into a rich North and a poor South.

A consistent coordinated policy approach in the EU is more urgent than ever on our doorstep, given developments in our globalised world and the problems, not least in the countries in need of development. Today, development policy can no longer be just a crisis policy or individual measures to combat hunger in the world. Foreign policy, agricultural measures, food security, fisheries policy, economic policy, financial policy, health, not least security policy, are policy areas that are inseparable in development cooperation. That is why we must now turn the texts and words into action, in cooperation between the EU institutions and the Member States, but also in the cooperation of the various areas of the Commission, and last but not least, here in the European Parliament, we must also look at the fact that we are also making greater use of policy coherence in development cooperation between our own committees.

As we have just adopted the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, are preparing to revise the Cotonou agreement and the European Union is experiencing an unprecedented migration crisis, it is more crucial than ever to redouble efforts to ensure that policy coherence for development becomes a real mode of action and delivers results beyond the concept stage. I would like to focus on four things. First, the coherence of development policies must contribute to the establishment of the rule of law, democracy and good governance in developing countries, in order to serve the goal and ambition of sustainable results. Without stable democratic states, development assistance irrigates plants without root and therefore unable to produce fruit. Secondly, I would like to underline the key role of the national parliaments and the European Parliament, on the one hand, and the Union delegations, on the other, in ensuring a coherence not only horizontal but also vertical of policies. This role needs to be strengthened, particularly in the policy-making of parliaments and the implementation by delegations.  Third, ownership is a key issue. In reality, the CPD is to ensure that, in the medium term, every directorate-general, every ministry, every region, every embassy or delegation embraces the objectives of European development policy. Efforts must continue in this direction.  Fourth and final point, I support the rapporteur's idea of a European summit dedicated to policy coherence for development. This should enable concrete recommendations and a renewal of the commitment for the CPD, such as a genuine modus vivendi and operandi in all external dimensions of the Union's action. In conclusion, Mr President, let us not forget that the coherence of policies in the service of development is essential to protect the Union's capacity for action, credibility and budgetary effectiveness.

All this without forgetting the attempt to export and impose models of economic and political organisation that most often disrespect the sovereignty, needs and legitimate choices of developing countries.

First of all, we all agree that the coherence of all European Union policies is a key issue and is enshrined in the Lisbon Treaty. You mentioned important issues relating to tax evasion and tax avoidance, tax loopholes and tax havens. All these things are, of course, very important today and we must address those challenges. The refugee problem was also mentioned, as well as issues related to human rights. There were also questions about TTIP and about our treaties with Japan. The European Union takes into account sustainable development in its trade agreements. First, impact assessments are carried out. Second, chapters on sustainable development are part of the agreements. All trade agreements are decided on according to well—established rules involving the European Parliament. I agree that ensuring effective coordination in our daily work and placing policy coherence for development within the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are key. We stand ready to work closely with Parliament in this direction, in the context of the ongoing revision of the European Consensus on Development.

Allow me to update you on how we are working towards ensuring the facility will be operated only with the highest level of safety standards. Nuclear safety remains a key priority for the Commission as confirmed by the Energy Union Framework Strategy.  While fostering cooperation, transparency and trust, we are using all the instruments at our disposal to ensure the highest possible safety standards in the EU and internationally. This is absolutely non-negotiable. On EU-Belarus nuclear safety cooperation: that is exactly the approach we have always taken with Belarus – nuclear safety and radiological protection have always been the key focus of our exchanges.  Since 2011, the European Union has been providing the Belarusian nuclear regulatory authority with technical assistance under the EU’s Instrument for Nuclear Safety cooperation by transferring EU best practices on the regulatory process, including formulation of licensing conditions and inspection practices, from site selection to commissioning and operation. Since April 2015, one EU expert has been based in Minsk, where we have been strengthening the regulator during the construction of the nuclear plant project from an early stage. The ultimate aim is to share EU expertise and build national capacity to ensure compliance with the best international practices and standards.  Through this technical assistance the competent regulatory authority of Belarus has improved its human and technical capacity. However, the Commission considers that the independence of the Belarusian regulator has to be further strengthened and a close monitoring of development is therefore needed.  On nuclear safety stress tests: as I said before, openness and transparency is essential when it comes to nuclear safety. By working together with our neighbours in an open way we can benefit from the exchange of information and expertise while building trust. In that spirit, the Commission welcomes Belarus’s extensive use of IAEA expert peer review services to help ensure safety.  Before I address where we are with the Ostrovets nuclear safety stress test, I would like to clarify two things which are essential in understanding the overall process.  Firstly, nuclear safety stress tests, both in the EU and in third countries, are carried out on a voluntary basis. Legally speaking, the European Union cannot oblige any Member State, nor third countries, which choose nuclear energy, to undertake such stress tests. Nevertheless, there is a political commitment to perform stress tests within the EU and an encouragement to extend them outside, as the March 2011 European Council called not only for comprehensive and transparent risk and safety assessments of all EU nuclear power plants, but also for carrying out similar stress tests in the neighbouring countries and worldwide. Since then, the Commission has been promoting the undertaking of stress tests in neighbouring countries. It is encouraging that Ukraine has already voluntarily participated in such an exercise and Armenia is currently in the process of doing so, supported financially by the European Union.  Secondly, a stress test is a national competence. It is performed by the operator and supervised by the national nuclear regulatory authority. It is only after the national stress test assessment is finalised and the outcome of the assessment is reported on, that the Commission can and in fact does organise peer reviews by EU national nuclear safety authorities. In June 2011, based on a Commission initiative, several neighbouring countries, including Belarus, confirmed their willingness to undertake nuclear stress tests by signing the Declaration on conducting nuclear safety stress tests.  Since then, we have been urging Belarus to perform a nuclear safety stress test. The Commission expects, in the light of the Council conclusions in February 2016, that EU-Belarus cooperation will evolve positively also in this regard.  What are the next steps? The Commission was informed by Belarus that it has now put in place a legal instrument regulating the implementation of nuclear safety stress tests in line with European specifications. Belarus has also indicated that upon conclusion of the Ostrovets stress test process, the national assessment report will be presented to the Commission in the course of 2016 and 2017.  On our side, the necessary preparations for the peer review have already been done, and it is now in the work programme of the European Nuclear Safety Regulators Group. Together with the Commission, this group of experts will organise the peer review as soon as we receive the national assessment report.  While this is already a positive development, the Commission would like to speed up the process’s implementation in Belarus and to receive the stress test report as soon as possible. Therefore, our services are planning a technical mission to Belarus in the coming months to discuss progress.  To conclude, let me assure you that the Commission remains fully committed to raising nuclear safety with the Belarusian authorities at all political levels. We will continue to promote the highest level of standards on nuclear safety in Belarus, together with all of our international partners.  Let me also assure you that we are in close contact with the neighbouring Member States, in particular Lithuania, to follow the developments with the Ostrovets nuclear power plant. I will ensure that the European Parliament is kept fully up to date with all the developments as and when they happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 65, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Andrejs MAMIKINS", "mepid": "124746", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, the Belarusian nuclear power station was first envisaged backed in the 1980s. However, due to the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 these plans were halted until less than a decade ago. Construction began in 2013 and should cost around USD 10 billion. It must be pointed out that the reactor employed, a water-water energetic reactor, is the same as is currently planned for use in the Hanhikivi nuclear power plant in Finland. The fears of the international community, especially Lithuania, are understandable. Belarus has never had a nuclear power plant on its territory, thus raising fears of inability to operate it properly. Therefore, in order to alleviate these concerns, Belarus should allow for a series of necessary stress tests performed under the auspices of the International Atomic Energy Agency, as well as a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, particularly on the matter of drinking-water sources shared with Lithuania. With EU sanctions lifted, relations between the EU and Belarus are once again moving forward. I believe, therefore, that a solution to the current issues around the Ostrovets nuclear power plant will be found soon, since, in the field of nuclear energy, there can be no other way but multilateral cooperation between all parties involved, directly or indirectly, be that Belarus, Lithuania, the EU, the Russian Federation, whose specialists are building the plant, or any other international institution concerned.

Unfortunately, I am disappointed that Commissioner Cañete has not found an opportunity to answer an important question of his competence regarding the threat posed by the construction of nuclear facilities at the border of the European Union. I am even more disappointed with the Commission's response to the huge problem of the construction of the Astravo power plant, which is in breach of international environmental and nuclear safety standards. The signals sent from the Commission are formal and even misleading. I am referring, in particular, to Commissioner Cañete's previous reply to me that the 'stress' tests were carried out at the Belarusian nuclear power plant when they had not even started. The recent statement by Health Commissioner Andrew that Belarus is implementing all the necessary international conventions is also perplexed.  Meanwhile, the Arhus and Espoo Conventions organisations found Belarus to be in breach of these conventions in 2014. Belarus ignores such conclusions, but why is it closed to the Commission, which is a member of these conventions? Understand our concerns – at the border between Lithuania and the European Union, an authoritarian state is building a nuclear power plant with the hands of a Russian company very quickly, and all this is done in accordance with international standards. Especially since we know what a culture of work is and what the approach to transparency is. For example, a serious incident occurred in construction in April – part of the construction collapsed – but Minsk tried to cover up the incident. The attitude of the resin Belarus is also demonstrated by the selection of the site itself without inviting the IAEA site evaluation mission. The list of violations and opacity is long. Belarus does not answer questions about the impact on the main rivers of Lithuania, due to the resilience in the event of the plane's fall, does not prepare emergency preparedness plans, does not worry about the management of nuclear fuel waste, ignores seismological studies and so on. In addition, your report has just recognised that the Belarusian nuclear safety regulator is not independent. This means that nuclear safety does not depend on experts, but on the undemocratic state government. I therefore urge the Commission to present to the European Parliament as soon as possible a very specific threat plan that will force Belarus to comply with international safety and transparency standards. This plan should also send a clear message to Minsk that electricity generation at the expense of the power plant built at the expense of security measures intersects with the principles of fair trade, and such electricity is undesirable on the European Union market.

It is indeed worrying that this plant has not been subjected to the stress test recommended by the European Parliament's resolution of 14 March 2013. However, this test is an indispensable precaution. It was carried out after Fukushima on 145 reactors within the European Union and on 20 reactors outside the EU. The 2013 resolution thus developed a culture of nuclear safety in Europe that Belarus would be well advised to respect.  This is all the more desirable since the Ostrovets power plant is located only 50 kilometres from Vilnius, the capital of Lithuania. Nuclear safety is also the subject of international cooperation organized, under the control of the International Atomic Energy Agency, by the Treaty of 17 June 1994. This international cooperation will, of course, continue within the framework of the Europe of nations, which I call for. However, legitimate concern about the safety of Ostrovets should not be used by the Union to attack Russia once again.

Finland, the USA and great Britain want to build new nuclear power plants. In Belgium, a power plant close to the German border, which was shut down due to Fukushima, is being reconnected to the grid.

In Hungary, my state, two new Russian—type blocks are going to be built in the next couple of years. This is just the same construction and the same technology as in Ostrovets, Belarus: the Russian—type VVER 1200 reactors. This Member State, Hungary, has already proved that it understands EU law in quite a ‘flexible’ way when it comes to nuclear projects. Regarding this nuclear project in Hungary, there was a veto from the Euratom Supply Agency because the contract with Russia was not in line with EU law. There is an ongoing infringement because of the lack of tendering, according to European public procurement law. There is an in-depth investigation because of non—tendering. There is an in-depth investigation because of possible forbidden state aid regarding the same project. That was a concluded pilot project because of the lack of transparency of the project. This Member State intentionally violated the EU regulation regarding nuclear waste with unlawfully shipped nuclear waste from a former serious incident in the existing NPP to Russia in 2014.

By way of wrap-up, I would like to pick up on a few of the wider issues raised during the debate, but first on the Ostrovets case.  Let me underline what I said at the start: the Commission will continue to use all the instruments at its disposal to ensure the highest possible safety standards in the EU and internationally. That is non-negotiable, as I already said. That is why our priority is now to ensure the timely implementation of Ostrovets nuclear safety stress tests in line with European specifications.  As always, the Commission will keep this House fully up to date with any developments as and when they happen. But let me be clear. Many of the solutions to the questions raised in this debate lie in the need to end energy isolation and complete Europe’s internal energy market. For Lithuania, as well as for all Baltic states, this means that we need to continue working towards their full integration into the European energy market. The good news is that we are making progress. We recently saw the start of operations for the electricity interconnections of Lithuania with Poland and Sweden. Thanks to the LitPol Link and NordBalt, the level of interconnection of the Baltic States with the rest of the European grid has substantially increased, from 4% in early 2014 to approximately 22%.  On gas, work is under way on the game-changing Gas Interconnector Poland-Lithuania. GIPL, as it is called, is the first gas interconnector between the Eastern Baltic Sea region and Continental Europe. When complete in 2019 it will end the region’s gas isolation, further diversify gas sources, routes and counterparts, and ultimately help to reduce prices for consumers. Much of this progress is thanks in large part to the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan, which brings together all the Baltic states to cooperate on integrating the region into a European network. This is an example to others on what we can achieve under the Energy Union. But we must build on this progress.  Our next challenge is to ensure the synchronisation of the Baltic States and other isolated regions with the rest of the EU market. Our vision is of an Energy Union based on solidarity and trust, which speaks with one voice to our external partners and which, ultimately, provides the secure and sustainable energy Europe’s citizens need. That is why the Energy Union is a top Commission priority and why our focus is fully on implementation.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The new Alliance for Food Security in Africa was launched by the G8 countries in 2012. This large public private partnership is intended to attract investment in agriculture in sub-Saharan Africa in order to improve food security there. Ten African countries are involved. The EU is co-financing the initiative. In total, donor countries have pledged more than six billion U.S. dollars. The new alliance wants to emulate the model of the Green Revolution in Asia in the 1960s and 1970s. The limits of this approach and, in particular, the environmental risks associated with it are well known. Under the new alliance, African countries will be asked to implement legislative reforms to create a business-friendly environment for private investment in Africa's agriculture. Remarkably, smallholders were hardly involved in this process, although they were ultimately supposed to be the beneficiaries. Consequently, the new alliance has been heavily criticised by civil society, by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, and by African small farmers themselves. Parliament's Committee on Development has dealt with the report in detail and will take up some worrying phenomena. Firstly, the type of agriculture and farming methods, secondly: transparency and governance, thirdly: legislative reforms, fourthly, the gender issue. Firstly, the nature of agriculture and farming methods: both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Climate Agreement indicate the need to develop an agricultural model that is much more resilient and can create sustainable food systems. The report calls on the governments in Africa not to support the model of business-oriented agriculture based on large farms, but to invest in family farms and agro-ecology. This is because family farms – small farmers – are the main investors in African agriculture and provide more than 60% of the jobs in sub-Saharan Africa. Transparency and governance: detailed information on multilateral development initiatives such as the new alliance should be accessible. At present, there are not enough details about the investment plans of the companies. We need full transparency, robust monitoring mechanisms and performance indicators, adequate institutional and legal frameworks, prior consultations with the many stakeholders and stakeholders, and a complaints mechanism for local people and communities. All participating countries must effectively implement the relevant international standards to ensure that investments respect all human rights. Business-friendly legislation: As mentioned, african countries involved are invited to implement certain business-friendly legislation, including in the area of land and seeds. Although there are various forms of land use and ownership rights in Africa, the corporate frameworks only consider the identification of land holdings when safeguarding the rights of use and ownership. The new study by the DROI Committee confirms that human rights violations have occurred under the new alliance in land transactions involving European companies and donor institutions. This is totally unacceptable. The new alliance also calls for corporate law reforms in seed law. 90% of farmers depend on the free production and exchange of their seeds. I am very concerned that the new alliance will prevent most countries from using these informal methods. I am similarly concerned about gender issues. Only 21% of small-scale farms where women are in charge were involved, despite the fact that 50% of women run sub-Saharan Africa. To sum up, the main players in the private sector are multinationals that already have a dominant market position. In addition, there is a major market imbalance between international agricultural groups, regional and national players in the countries of Africa. There are grave doubts that the new alliance will be able to contribute to poverty reduction and food security. That is why the EU and the Member States should carefully consider whether their participation in this initiative is effective at all or whether we are instead investing better together in sustainable agricultural models, as decided in the sustainable development goals.

Mr President, the way in which the New Alliance for Food Security and Nutrition in Africa operates, which is a public-private partnership to support Sub-Saharan Africa and tackle poverty, reminds me a little of the troika in Greece. In other words, it wants to impose legislation on all the Member States involved, it wants to change the conditions for land ownership, it also wants to put conditions on the way seeds are used.  I therefore see an intervention in the internal affairs of the Member States and I wonder whether there will really be substantial assistance.

It is in line with what the Commission wants to achieve under the New Alliance. Together with our partners – African governments, the African Union Commission, the private sector and G7 members – the European Union has made a commitment to promoting inclusive and sustainable agriculture-based growth. The agricultural sector in low-income countries has suffered from under-investment for decades with considerable consequences for long-term food security while also contributing to rural poverty. The investments needed to eradicate hunger are enormous.  We thus have to work together with all partners. This is what we agreed under the 2030 Agenda and its second Sustainable Development Goal: to end hunger, achieve food security and improve nutrition and also promote sustainable agriculture. In doing so we will need to mobilise additional resources for developing countries. This is what the New Alliance is trying to do: reduce poverty and link smallholders to markets by working with the local and international private sector. The European Union has been supporting the New Alliance since its launch in 2012 and has since committed EUR 1.2 billion in ten new alliance countries. This represents a powerful initiative to reduce rural poverty. Food and nutrition security in our developing partner countries is a priority area for the Commission. We want to contribute to job creation, stability, growth and sustainable development. In all our programmes under the New Alliance we make sure that we are working towards this objective.  The Commission is a staunch supporter of the voluntary guidelines on tenure of land and of the principles for responsible investment in agriculture and food systems. Within the New Alliance we have developed guidance for companies on due diligence and risk management for land-based investments in agriculture. Gender is also a prominent component in the New Alliance. Fifty-one per cent of the jobs created in 2014 benefited women. At the same time, the Commission will continue to insist on a much more targeted focus on women farmers and entrepreneurs and on actions to ensure they have equal access to land and other economic resources. Of course there are many challenges associated with our efforts and we are working hard to solve them. We are taking very seriously the concerns being voiced that the New Alliance creates a favourable environment that mainly benefits large private sector companies to the detriment of the smallholder farmers. Many of the concerns raised also here today are an integral part of the discussions with our partners in the new alliance. The European Union is very sensitive towards the smallholder farmers. They play a key role in sustainable agriculture and in combating hunger and malnutrition, and they are indeed the ones that should primarily benefit from the New Alliance actions. The European Union is also very attentive to the plight of the most vulnerable in societies who, despite the advances made, remain susceptible to crises and shocks and will continue to need our humanitarian and development assistance. We need partnerships with the private sector that encourage businesses to put sustainable development at the core of their strategies. This is particularly relevant for inclusive and sustainable agricultural development. The only option is to work together and to act responsibly, inclusively and sustainably. This also includes more involvement of farmers in civil society and the coordination of new alliance activities. The Commission will discuss and explore with all partners in the New Alliance how to better advance its implementation, also in the light of the conclusions and recommendations of this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 2, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Theodor Dumitru STOLOJAN", "mepid": "39721", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, first of all, I would like to thank all of the shadow rapporteurs who contributed to this report on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). It is the first time that the European Parliament presents its strategic view on the issue of IFRS. These standards are the bedrock of all investment decisions in the global capital markets, and of the evaluation of company management on behalf of its shareholders. For over a year, we have held many debates, seminars and hearings, with different stakeholders, standard setters, academics and experts. Let me focus on the main points of this report. We think that the concept of public good for the IFRS should be clarified, as well as the potential conflict between the private nature of the IASB, the standard setter, and the public good nature of the IFRS that are applied today in more than 110 countries and jurisdictions. There are differences between how we in the European Union understand the concept of true and fair view, the principles of prudence and stewardship, which are the basis of accounting standards, and the accounting setters view on this concept and principle. We insist on the need for an impact assessment for every new accounting standard or change of a current accounting standard. We think about the future of EFRAG, the private technical advisor of the European Commission in the process of IFRS endorsement in the European Union, and about the possibility on the long-term to transform EFRAG into a European agency.

I note with pleasure that we have a common understanding on many issues.  Our conclusions of the evaluation of the IAS Regulation were overall positive on the experience with IFRS and on the endorsement process, with practical improvements identified. We will carefully consider all the recommendations listed in the report. In fact we have been working on some of them already for some time. In particular, we have noted the need for a better coordination between all actors in the endorsement process. We, therefore, welcome the set-up of a European Parliament permanent IFRS team which has already been a helpful forum to discuss IFRS-related issues.  Regarding the governance of the bodies developing and advising on the standards, in our reply to the IFRS Foundation’s consultations on their structure and effectiveness, we passed a strong message to improve the public accountability of the IFRS Foundation. We wish to see a more active Monitoring Board on issues of public interest, an allocation of top jobs to countries that fund it and use its IFRS standards, and a strengthened effects analysis.  For EFRAG, the appointment of the President of the Board in the coming weeks will be the last step of the reform. Following the withdrawal of Wolf Klinz and the need for another selection procedure, the Commission selected Jean-Paul Gauzès. We are pleased to note that the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs agreed on 30 May to support Mr Gauzès’s nomination.  In parallel, our services are intensively working with EFRAG to establish a sound basis for a solid effects analysis methodology which we would like EFRAG to apply in support of their future endorsement advices. Consequently, I am counting on the support of the European Parliament to ensure a rapid adoption of our proposal to extend the co-financing of EFRAG for the period 2017-2020 along the same lines as was earlier agreed with Parliament with respect to the IFRS Foundation and the PIOB (Public Interest Oversight Board). Regarding the request for clarification of certain endorsement criteria such as ‘the public good’ and the ‘true and fair’ principle, I am pleased to inform you that our services have had very constructive and substantial discussions with representatives of the Member States in the Accounting Regulatory Committee. We have reached common grounds on these issues in that Committee. The case law has been analysed and the Maystadt report was taken into account. We will shortly publish the outcome of these discussions and we would be happy to discuss our findings with Parliament, to start with in the European Parliament IFRS team, if you like.  In this context, I would like to mention that at this moment, we see no compelling need to review the existing legislation. On balance, the endorsement process works well and I believe we can bring meaningful improvements with respect to the endorsement process, including with respect to the application of concepts such as ‘public good’ and ‘true and fair’, without the need to legislate, by providing stakeholders and those involved in the standard setting process with the necessary clarifications.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Romana TOMC", "mepid": "125104", "text": "  Writing. – International accounting standards are an essential element for the efficient functioning of the market and have contributed to a general improvement in the quality of accounting data and statements, benefiting both the single market and capital markets.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their cooperation and efforts in helping to achieve this. I believe we have a report that is strongly supported across Parliament. It deals with a critical issue bearing on so many current concerns in our countries. We have seen flows of refugees and economic migrants, as well as the terrorist threat, increasing – and, by the time these problems are on the doorstep of Europe, it is too late. It is therefore in our interest not only to put our own houses in order so that we reduce the pull factors and our own vulnerabilities, but also to help the African countries, in particular, to deal with their problems. It is thus in all our interests for African countries, and the African Union in particular, to do more to create peace and stability on their continent, but they need help to achieve this, particularly in building capacity. A key priority is to make the African Standby Force operational and really effective as soon as possible. This requires stronger political will and engagement from the African countries themselves, more advocacy by us in African capitals and practical assistance by our Member States and – in terms of funding and civil resources – by the EU itself. So often, Parliament’s reports give the impression that the EU alone is shouldering the world’s problems. This is far from the truth. We need to recognise the efforts of the United Nations, the African Union, the United States and NATO, as well as many individual European countries, in addition to the excellent contribution from the EU itself. The EU must also avoid duplicating the work of others. There needs to be greater cooperation and communication between all those involved. Given the scale of the challenges and the complex involvement of other organisations and nations, the EU should seek an appropriate division of labour, focusing on where it can best add value, including through support to operations by individual Member States. There is probably sufficient funding available to Africa and for peace support operations. It is a question of how it is spent. There is a requirement for greater transparency and accountability in order to give assurance about appropriate spending. We have a duty to ensure funds are not abused or wasted. The EU should focus its efforts: it needs to prioritise. There are a great many issues to be dealt with and it would be most effective to be selective in the ones we attempt to tackle. Our engagement over the years in helping overcome the problem of anti-personnel landmines, which have been such a threat in post-conflict development, is a case in point. I do not happen to believe that promotion of the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) agenda is the right focus. Others are better able to provide military support. The EU can be useful in other ways. I therefore do not support the references to the CSDP that have been made through amendments to my report in committee. In order for peace support operations (PSOs) in Africa to be effective in bringing about real change, there must be a consistent drive towards a more coordinated response by all international actors. The UN must carry the main responsibility for external military intervention, but the African Union must increasingly take the regional lead, supported by the most capable of our nations, as well as by the United States, NATO and the EU as appropriate. Enhanced international collaboration, appropriate division of labour and a continued emphasis on African capability and responsibility must be our priorities. The needs of the African countries concerned and the security and cohesion of our own countries should be the overall guiding principles for EU involvement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 121, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Bogdan Andrzej ZDROJEWSKI", "mepid": "124893", "text": "   – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab This is a good report.

Madam President, foreign intervention is and will remain reprehensible no matter what form it takes. In the name of supporting peace, countries were dismembered, entire societies were condemned to underdevelopment and peoples disappeared. The assessment of recent interventions and interventions in Africa is no exception to this description; interventions unsuccessful even from a military point of view. What happened in Somalia, the Sahel, Libya? These examples are not random. They are three areas in which, after foreign military intervention, Salafis Islam became stronger. In other words, the Iraq scenario was repeated in full.  But decisions come at a cost, especially irresponsible decisions, particularly from France, whose successive governments and eminent so-called intellectuals are trying to drag the whole of Europe into catastrophic wars in Africa. So let France assume its responsibilities, especially in relation to refugees and migrants who drown every day off the coast of Crete and Lampedusa.

I also very much appreciate the close involvement of both the Committee on Development and the Subcommittee on Security and Defence on this important issue, which falls at the intersection of security and development. The UN and the African Union are our strategic partners in preventing conflicts, promoting stability and building peace in Africa, including through the deployment of peace support operations in crisis and post-conflict scenarios. Peace and security is a priority area of cooperation under both the Africa-EU Strategic Partnership and the new EU-UN Strategic Partnership. African-led peace support operations receive substantial financial support from the European Union under the African Peace Facility (APF).

The establishment of the African Standby Force is an important milestone in this regard. Let me also recall that, through the APF, we provide support not only to African-led missions, but also to the overall African Peace and Security Architecture and to the Early Response Mechanism, which plays a critical role in conflict prevention and resolution by enabling African mediation and preventive diplomacy actions. We are working hard to ensure the financial sustainability of the APF, which is being called on to provide support to an increasing number of peace and security operations. But this needs fairer burden sharing with our African and international partners, as called for in the report. We raised this important issue at the recent meeting of the Commission with the African Union Commission. EU crisis management missions and operations in Africa, under our Common Security and Defence Policy, are also closely coordinated with the UN and AU, particularly when deployed in parallel to UN and/or African Union peace support operations, for instance in Somalia, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Mali. We maintain regular contacts with the African Union and the UN at all levels, from the planning stage to the end of the implementation stage, not only in the headquarters but also in the field, in order to ensure an efficient division of labour, to share relevant information, including on situational awareness, and, indeed, to conduct joint conflict analysis, for instance in the CAR. Cooperation with the UN in building African Union peace and security capacities is also close and fruitful, not only in crisis management, early warning and mediation but also in policy areas such as security-sector reform and disarmament, demobilisation and the reintegration of ex—combatants. When building African capacities in police and criminal justice matters, we also discuss with the UN relevant principles and approaches. Beyond the specific case of Africa, we also welcome the draft report’s support for the objectives of the recent Joint Communication on Capacity Building for Security and Development, which aims at better enabling our partners to prevent and manage crises by themselves, acknowledging the need to provide support to both the civilian law-enforcement services and the military, particularly in conflict-affected countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Edward CZESAK", "mepid": "132925", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab I am pleased that today, almost a year after the start of work on the project, I can present a final report on unfair commercial practices in the food supply chain. The report was started by Dawid Jackiewicz, now a minister in the Government of the Republic of Poland. I would like to emphasise the significant contribution made by both the Member and his colleagues and the staff of the Secretariat. The involvement of Members from different political groups, in particular shadow Members, was also important for the final shape of the report. Thank you all very much for your time and activity. I am aware that the subject matter of the report is extremely important, both for distributors and suppliers, and that its final text and message will be of great importance for the future of relations between the two groups.  In the report, we have made it clear that UTPs are a problem that is confirmed by all actors in the food supply chain and national competition authorities. Concrete examples confirm the importance of this problem, including in the UK and Poland. A number of meetings have taken place during the work on the report, both with international and national organisations. A number of suggestions and experience have been made on the functioning of both voluntary and legislative solutions at national level. The Commission and Parliament have repeatedly highlighted the problem of UTPs, including in the Commission's report of 29 January. We do not know the opinion on it, but we know that the opinions are divided. For example, the review of solutions to tackle UTPs in the Member States confirms that voluntary initiatives are currently proving insufficient. The report makes recommendations to support the need for hard work on solutions to improve the relationship between suppliers and supermarkets, including minimising the fear factor. We have also called on the Commission to take action to formulate new tools to strengthen action to combat unfair practices. Almost all Member States have put in place regulatory arrangements to complement good practices. Today we can already say that, in the context of the Commission's report, the experience of other countries described confirms that voluntary initiatives can only have a complementary effect. However, the initiatives currently in place are fraught with the shortcomings that we point out in the report. Most countries have recently introduced their own national regulations. Member States should therefore be encouraged to exchange experience on regulatory solutions. You should also ask if that is enough. I believe that the joint content of the report will be a significant step in tackling unfair commercial practices in the food supply chain. We all want the relations between the trading environments to be transparent and equal.

Madam President, I believe that the European Parliament must be clear on this issue. We must support and shield consumers, producers and small and medium-sized enterprises from the unfair practices applied in the food chain and in trade by the various large enterprises. I believe that we are all consumers and we know that the weak link in this food chain is consumers, above all, producers but also small and medium-sized enterprises. This large food supply chain plays an important role in economies and society, accounting for 4.3% of the European Union's Gross National Product and 17% of small and medium-sized enterprises. We therefore support, strengthen and seal the framework, strengthen competition law and the institutional framework that must be in favour of the consumer, protect him, respect the rights of the consumer, give him great transparency.

The Commission would like to thank the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection for this report on unfair trading practices in the food supply chain. In particular I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Czesak, for his hard work on this report. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and rapporteurs from other committees, in particular Ms McGuinness, for their input. I fully share your views about the importance of the food supply chain. It affects all of us as European citizens so it is crucial that the chain functions well. There are very large and very small players operating in the food chain, and commercial relationships between these companies usually work reasonably well. Of course, negotiations can sometimes be tough but what we need to avoid is companies’ abusing large differences in bargaining power to apply unfair trading practices. I fully agree with you that this is not acceptable. For the agricultural sector I have asked the Agricultural Markets Task Force to further assess the issue of unfair trading practices and I look forward to their conclusions and their recommendations later this year. As you know, unfair trading practices have been a hot issue in many Member States in recent years. Your report acknowledges the numerous initiatives that have been taken to address the issue. We reported on this in January: we found that 20 Member States had introduced legislation against unfair trading practices and more were planning to do so. Obviously there is a problem when so many Member States have acted in a legislative way. Where Member States have identified a major problem they have introduced comprehensive and strong enforcement measures. It is true that Member States have taken different approaches on the issue. Most of these national frameworks are quite recent. So I agree that we should continuously monitor and assess these national frameworks to see if they are working or not. And that is what we will do. An important achievement in the fight against unfair practices was the launch of the EU voluntary Supply Chain Initiative. Your report welcomes this initiative but points to a number of weaknesses. You suggested that, because of these, farmer representatives have not joined the scheme. We agree that the initiative was a step in the right direction and commercial issues cannot always be solved by regulation alone. Any measure that aims to build trust between the parties should be given a serious chance. And we agree with you that there are very concrete points that can and must still be improved. So we will work together with all relevant stakeholders to make this happen. As voluntary efforts go, this is give and take. We hope that farmer representatives will reconsider joining the initiative so that they can prove its value and can make their case within it. We welcome Mr Czesak’s report, we will reflect in detail on its suggestions, and together we need to focus on actions that can truly make a change and add value, and I am committing myself to do so in conjunction with the report of the Agricultural Markets Task Force later this year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 140, "date": "2016-06-06.json", "name": "Petras AUŠTREVIČIUS", "mepid": "124766", "text": "  in writing. – Unfair trading practices (UTPs) can affect small food producers and retailers in business relationships where one party is in a stronger position than the other.

The abuse of a stronger market position by large companies deprives small and medium-sized enterprises of their ability to invest and thus blocks the development of this sector of the economy in the EU single market. The prevalence of UTPs and their application to small food producers and retailers shows the weakness of existing self-regulatory mechanisms in order to restore market equilibrium. Not without impact on the ineffectiveness of these mechanisms is the \"fear factor\" raised in this report, which in a sense forces small and medium-sized producers to submit to unfair practices for fear of severing trade relations by a stronger party - a large corporation.

It is estimated that there will be nearly 2.5 billion more people on the planet by 2050 than there are today, so satisfying the demand for safe, healthy and nutritious food is one of the biggest challenges facing our world. Land availability is shrinking; we have environmental degradation, shortages of water and increased energy demand, not to mention the emergence of new pests and diseases – all of which are putting real pressure on the natural environment. So we need to develop technological solutions not only to increase production, but to improve the means of distribution and to tackle food waste, and the benefits of innovative technologies need to be applicable and available to all our farmers whether they are conventional or organic, livestock or arable, small scale or large scale. Concern about food security has brought a new focus to public sector research and development in recent years, but European agriculture continues to trail behind many of its international competitors. What we need is sustained and prioritised investment in applied and translational research. Not enough research is commercialised, and that means that farmers are not able to take advantage of the opportunities that innovation could provide, Take precision farming, for example. My report calls on the Commission and the Member States to work in partnership to improve the performance and adaptability of PF techniques.  Agriculture accounts for 70% of the world’s freshwater use – 70%. Now this can be significantly reduced by the use of precision irrigation techniques. My report welcomes the inclusion of PF robotics in Horizon 2020 and encourages the uptake of GPS-driven machinery and drones. It welcomes the development of controlled traffic farming technologies which reduce soil damage. It welcomes efforts to integrate high-resolution remote sensing technology into organic farming.  The report also covers the need for continuous progress in innovative breeding aimed at increasing not only the range of pest- and disease-resistant traits in crops, but also the range of food raw materials with nutritional and health beneficial characteristics on the market. The loss of genetic diversity over the past century threatens our food and feed security, so all plant varieties, animal species, land races, wild and semi-wild relatives, they are all essential for maintaining genetic diversity. And we should be encouraging an open and transparent dialogue among the stakeholders and the public on responsible development of high-precision innovative solutions for breeding programmes, including risks, hazards and benefits. We need to raise awareness and understanding of new techniques among farmers and the general public, and we have to make sure that consumers and farmers are sufficiently educated about new breeding techniques to ensure that open and informed public debate can take place.  Europe should be a world leader in agricultural technology. Farmers are the major stewards of our environment and they need continued access to innovation, new technology and research in order to produce food in a sustainable way. So we need all to work together – the EU and the Member States, academia such as Harper Adams University in my region, the industry, breeders, agro-chemical sectors, all work together to make sure that we have the best research and we translate it practice, from lab to farm to fork.

This report is one of two reports that we will be discussing this evening regarding the importance of innovation in the development of agricultural production.  I share many of the rapporteur’s views which she has set out and I would like to comment on a few of the issues raised. What is particularly important is that the report focuses on the need for sustainable agriculture in the European Union. The report identifies a number of the challenges facing European agriculture in the decades ahead, not least in terms of global population growth and the increasing demand for food. In view of these challenges and those posed by climate change and the European Union’s commitment to meet the COP21 targets, the focus on sustainability is now more important than ever.  There are a number of aspects of the report that I welcome, including precision farming, soil and nutrient management, skills development and knowledge transfer. I welcome, too, the emphasis on reducing bureaucracy and red tape, all of which is consistent with my commitment to simplify the CAP. There is little doubt that big data and precision farming hold significant promise for the future of agricultural production in Europe, and the report encourages the Commission to stimulate the development and uptake of precision farming and to remove the barriers to the integration of fragmented ICT systems. The Commission is in fact very anxious to encourage more precision farming, but the conclusions of a focus group organised by the EIP network recently were that farmers are hesitant in the use of precision farming for several reasons. They do not want to be locked in by a single supplier of software and/or machinery. They want to retain ownership of their own data and they want to see whether an application has added value before they invest.  In view of the sustainability challenges that food production is facing, precision farming technologies offer many possibilities and we believe that many EIP pilot projects under the Rural Development Programme will show the usefulness of precision farming. Later this month our EIP Service Point will host a seminar to bring together businesses, many of them start-ups, that based their business model on the use of big data in the agricultural sector.  It seems that we all share similar concerns regarding genetic diversity. It is in our common interest to have a wide agricultural genetic diversity, but farmers will opt for the highest-yielding varieties and breeds, and as a result, we have already lost genetic diversity and risk losing even more. We have several tools to prevent this, such as support for in situ conservation – under rural development – and support for research in this area. On top of that, we now have an interesting pilot project made possible by a budget attributed by the European Parliament, on the sustainable use of genetic resources, looking for new market opportunities for certain neglected varieties or breeds. Finally, I would like to come back to the issues of skills development, knowledge transfer and research priorities. Farming is changing and will continue to change, and like many other sectors it is becoming an increasingly knowledge-based industry. As Ms McIntyre’s report says, we need the right skills for this. I note and welcome the importance you attach to the EIP and to on-farm demonstration. Knowledge transfer and knowledge generation are key and we should constantly ask ourselves whether we can improve our policy in this area. I have seen many good examples of innovation and the outcomes of research, and I can see the potential of such developments. However, I am only too well aware that this potential will never be realised unless we can translate the innovation into practical on-farm application, as you have recognised in your identification of the importance of knowledge transfer.  Traditionally we link knowledge generation also to research. In January we had a conference in Brussels to discuss with the sector what the priorities for such a long-term research agenda should be. The outcomes of that conference will certainly be taken into account, both for research programming under the remaining part of Horizon 2020 and beyond.

I am, for example, particularly shocked that there is a heavy emphasis on significantly increasing food production.

The report does not even mention the fight against waste, the issue of obesity or overeating that more and more people are suffering from.

There are huge opportunities and farmers are desperate to make the most of them. It's our job to give them the space to take those opportunities. That is what my report is about.  I am grateful to you, my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture, for the hard work you have put in to make the report better. Climate change, declining biodiversity, scarcity of natural resources such as water and fertile farmland and a growing resistance of antibiotics: the world around us is changing, with associated challenges. This requires new solutions.  Agriculture and horticulture can meet this challenge. Through knowledge and innovations, we can feed the growing world population with ever better food while improving environmental impacts and animal welfare. I'm proud of that. Agriculture and horticulture is still too often seen as something old-fashioned. Nothing could be further from the truth. Our tractors run on GPS, drones monitor our crops, waste streams such as manure can be converted into valuable products for fertilization or energy, and so on. I see it as my job to help farmers get rid of the wrong image. The sector is capable of feeding the world, saving the environment and taking good care of the animals. This can only be done if we give farmers and gardeners the space to innovate.  This is the main message of my report: ample job for innovation and entrepreneurship in the agricultural sector. The potential of the sector is far from being fully exploited. Ill-considered regulation is still too often in the way. Farmers and gardeners can do much more than they like now. It is up to us to give the farmers that space and not to be guided by groups that have made the vile of the farmer and horticulturalist a right to exist. No one knows his farm better than the farmers or the gardeners themselves. So let them think along about how we can achieve the desired goals. We must give them the confidence and space to apply new ideas and innovations. Do not count the farmer and horticulturalist on a checklist of measures that seem to have been devised from behind a desk, but on the actual contribution for people, animals and the environment.  Too many rules we make today are already out of date tomorrow. So make sure that there is room for new applications, for example by granting projects a pilot status. It is agriculture that has the potential to contribute to the economy of tomorrow by closing cycles, making smart use of the power of nature and connecting with the digital economy. In this way, we can fight pests in a natural way by means of insects, follow our products to the plate, give consumers a better understanding of the farming practice, but also bind CO2 in the soil.  My message to the European Commission and the European agriculture ministers is clear. Tomorrow's agriculture has arrived, but too often we are still lingering. Not only politics, but also the sector must take up the gauntlet. My report offers more than enough possibilities.  Tomorrow I hope that all my colleagues will support me in my explicit call for farmers to be at the heart of tomorrow's agricultural policy.

Madam President, the modernisation of small traditional and organic crops is the best, perhaps the only response to the American model of agriculture. The American model – what some in Europe are trying to impose on us through TTIR – is certainly very effective only for the giants of the agri-food sector and the lobbies of large producers, but it is disastrous for our environment, our health, future generations. It is disastrous for all the 25 million farmers in the countries of Europe, the majority of which have chosen and managed with hard struggle to maintain another organisation of production. So instead of pulling the rug under their feet, the European Union must support this legacy. There is no good compromise on TTIR. The European production model, based on the small plant, is at the opposite end of what the American and European multinationals are asking for.

From a number of conversations I have had with Mr Huitema, I am well aware of his interest in, and support for, innovation and agriculture. Indeed it is something of which I too am very supportive. The challenges facing our sector are such that a greater focus on innovation is essential, and I am pleased to say is happening. Why is innovation so important? Innovation allows the sector to develop new products, new production methods and services, to respond to challenges like climate change, and to address other societal challenges, particularly in the environment, as well as addressing issues around our competitiveness.  We are all increasingly conscious of the need to ensure food security and of the need for a greater focus on more sustainable food production. Mr Huitema has outlined very effectively the main thrust of his report and the proposals that he is making. I have taken very careful note of the many actions which the Commission is asked to take in relation to the issues raised, whether that is in relation to ICT-based management systems, the need to reduce the use of antimicrobials, or the need to stimulate integrated pest management. In relation to those areas in which the Commission is urged to act, I would like to underline the importance of subsidiarity. In many such areas, local conditions require local solutions, and the Commission is not automatically best placed to address all of these issues. Therefore the relevant level of policy intervention may be national or regional. I welcome the acknowledgment in the report that agriculture has always developed new practices and techniques, and I agree also that innovation is a prerequisite for maintaining this progress.  Perhaps it is useful to recall how innovation is addressed in the current policy mix. Both rural development policy and our research policy under Horizon 2020 stimulate and support innovation. Horizon 2020 is the European Union’s framework programme for research and innovation and a majority of support for agriculture and forestry, research and innovation, will be granted under societal challenge too, which includes food security, sustainable agriculture and forestry, marine and maritime issues, and inland water research and the bio-economy. Under our work programmes in 2016 and 2017 for societal challenge 2, in the relevant part in the Horizon 2020 policy, you will also see that we have already addressed many of the issues that are raised in the report. I think that under our work programmes of 2016 and 2017 you will see that Horizon 2020 has the largest research budget ever, with nearly EUR 80 billion funding available for 2014 until 2020, and EUR 3.7 billion euros are allocated to the relevant heading: societal challenge 2. But this is co-managed and co-shared by the Director General of Agricultural and Rural Development and the Director General for Research and Innovation. The total budget for DG AGRI under Horizon 2020 for seven years is EUR 1.5 billion. Four years of Horizon 2020 activities have already been programmed, from 2014 to 2017, representing on the agriculture side 71 topics for a budget of EUR 617 million financing, which is financing an expected 112 projects. 14 have started in April 2015, 22 are scheduled to start in the upcoming months, with others still to be submitted. In the last three years of the Horizon 2020, which is 2018-2020, will be programmed at once by September 2017. Out of the 118 rural development programmes, 94 will support the EIP actions in the current programing period. We also expect 3200 pilot projects to be implemented in 24 Member States. I note that the draft report is concerned about a fragmented implementation of the EIP under the rural development programmes. However, I believe that this is its strength. It is thanks to the subsidiarity engrained in the rural development policy that we can reach out across the whole of Europe with projects that are locally appropriate. We think that the current policy mix is a good one, because you cannot have ‘one size fits all’. We should always look critically at our instruments and policies to see whether we can improve them, and I will be glad to do. Last week I attended the informal meeting of European Union agriculture ministers in Mr Huitema’s native country. While there, I and the Ministers visited the STEK food exhibition in Eindhoven. The exhibition was dedicated to innovation in food production and consumption. While there we saw several very exciting and innovative uses of technology in crop and other food production. I think all of us were impressed with what we saw because it is representative of many of the issues you have raised here this evening: the practical application at farm level of the development of technology and the investment in and value of innovation.

Nowadays in most EU Member States, rural dwellers account for much less than half of the population. Whilst these tendencies may have a positive effect on job creation, education, housing or decreasing transportation costs due to usually permanent resettlement from their native places, rural areas essentially lose their future in every sense.

So it is time for Greece to demand war reparations and reparations from Albania for the criminal acts of the Nazi collaborators, especially now that Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama has officially accepted the so-called rights and therefore the obligations and responsibilities of the Chamides.
