In total in 2018, approximately 150 000 irregular arrivals were registered at our external borders in the Mediterranean. This represents a fall by a quarter compared with 2017 and is the lowest level in five years. This total for 2018 was also 92% below the peak of the migratory crisis in 2015. This shows that our resolute and comprehensive action and our engagement with key partner countries have paid off and should continue to be pursued. The number of deaths at sea remains too high, of course, and efforts must continue to bring it down. But in 2018 this number also decreased by a quarter since 2017, and on the central Mediterranean route alone, the decrease is more than 50%. The UNHCR estimates that in 2018 the Libyan Coast Guard rescued or intercepted nearly 50 000 migrants at sea. The EU holds an important stake in that number, and I would do like to start by referring to recent developments regarding Libya and the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa. Since 2014, the European Union has mobilised EUR 338 million on migration-related projects in Libya, EUR 318 million under the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, and EUR 20 million as bilateral assistance. One third – EUR 91 million – was granted to support the Libyan Coast Guard in the form of training, including on human rights and equipment to set up basic operational rooms for the Coast Guard in Tripoli and to support the development of Libya’s own Maritime Rescue Coordination Centre. EUNAVFOR Operation Sophia has so far provided training for a total of 237 coast guard personnel, and the European Asylum Support Office (EASO) has provided training on access to the asylum procedure. Regarding our support inland in Libya, an important component of the EU Emergency Trust Fund programme consists of EUR 134.7 million in assistance and protection services to stranded migrants. It also covers voluntary humanitarian return assistance by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), including reintegration support, which has benefited over 16 000 migrants in 2018 and over 19 000 migrants in 2017. The EU entirely supports the evacuation of asylum seekers and refugees from Libya in the framework of the Evacuation Transit Mechanism (ETM) by UNHCR. Since its start in 2017, this has so far benefited over 2 800 persons. Finally, on 4 December 2018, following a month of negotiations with the authorities, the UNHCR – again with EU support – was able to open a gathering and departure facility in Tripoli. The facility is the first open centre in Libya, hosting migrants released from detention centres in view of resettlement. Nevertheless, a number of challenges remain on all Mediterranean routes, and they are very different from one another. The European Council conclusions of June last year set out clear guidance for priority action on each route. Hence we will continue taking forward the implementation of existing policies on the eastern and central Mediterranean routes. On the eastern Mediterranean route, numbers remain low, but the significant increase of irregular arrivals at the Greek-Turkish land border shows that we must keep a vigilant attitude to any shifts along the route. In this respect, cooperation with Turkey under the EU—Turkey Statement, as well as with our Western Balkan partners, is essential. Our work with neighbouring Mediterranean countries on the more pressing issues has been complimented with further engagement with countries further afield in Africa. The regional dialogue in recent years, the Rabat and Khartoum Processes and the Valletta Action Plan represent useful frameworks for a comprehensive and deep cooperation with African partners. They are supplemented by a robust set of funding instruments, including the EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, through which the EU has been able to mobilise more than EUR 4 billion for actions across the main African migratory routes. New cooperation initiatives are also in the pipeline, like the upcoming EU—AU ministerial meeting of 21—22 January 2019, which will contribute to strengthening region—to—region ties and addressing common challenges. It will also establish a regular forum for discussions with our African partners. Regarding the reform of the EU asylum rules, the Council has worked intensively on these complex files during successive Presidencies. Fruitful negotiations have taken place between the Council and the European Parliament, which resulted in substantial progress on five of the seven proposals. The Romanian Presidency stands ready to continue these efforts in order to make progress where possible. For other important legislative files, like the Schengen Borders Code, the Visa Code and the Immigration Liaison Officers Regulation, the Presidency hopes to conclude the ongoing trilogues with Parliament before the elections. Regarding the reform of the European Border and Coast Guard, both co—legislators are putting a lot of effort into reaching a position which will allow them to start interinstitutional negotiations. However, there are still significant disagreements between Member States on some major issues of the asylum reform, in particular the Dublin Regulation. While all Member States agree on the importance of striking the right balance between responsibility and solidarity, it has so far proved impossible to find a compromise on the concrete elements of that balance. It has been argued that enhancing the responsibilities of Member States should be compensated by a predictable system which is capable of providing relief to frontline Member States faced with a crisis. Striking the right balance is not only about finding the right formula for the distribution mechanism. Solidarity can be expressed in different ways. The complexity of the situation is demonstrated by the fact that, notwithstanding the important decrease in the number of arrivals, there is still a high number of asylum applications, a big proportion of which are lodged in countries other than the frontline Member States. This shows that there are significant secondary movements which will need to be tackled if we want to come to a structural solution for the issue at stake.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  Please, colleagues, a little bit of respect for the speaker and do not interrupt.

However, while the context has changed and irregular migrant arrivals have dropped drastically, certain political attitudes have unfortunately not changed and so we find ourselves here again.  First of all, let me state that I am relieved that a solution has been found that allowed all the migrants on board the two NGO vessels to disembark in Malta. But also let’s not fool ourselves; having 49 people – 49 – on boats at sea for almost three weeks is not what the European Union stands for.  (Applause) It is even more shameful to think that this happened during the Christmas period. The European Union is about human values and solidarity and we are all determined to uphold these values. But if human values and solidarity are not upheld, it is not Europe.  At the Commission we spared no effort to call for and coordinate relocation pledges among Member States and make this disembarkation possible. I was myself, day and night, in direct contact with a number of ministers. I have also called publicly on all Member States to show more solidarity. This is a message I will keep repeating because we cannot continue to negotiate with human lives at sea.  First, I wish to commend Malta, as one of our smallest Member States, for demonstrating such solidarity and I plan to visit Malta very soon.  (Applause) I would also like to thank all the Member States that agreed to receive the migrants who disembarked in Malta: Germany, France, Portugal, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, Ireland and Italy.  (Applause) All these countries have shown European solidarity in the most concrete way possible. But the European Union simply cannot continue to rely on unorganised ad hoc solutions when it comes to disembarkation. I was in Italy, as you know, yesterday where I had constructive discussions with the leadership of the country, with Prime Minster Conte and Interior Minister Salvini. We are all committed to establishing a truly European solidarity mechanism because it is not only through a European approach that we can really manage this challenge. The situation today is already proof of that.  The number of irregular arrivals today is nowhere near to that of three years ago and is 80% less than last year, and yet the political resistance today seems almost bigger. I ask everyone to open their eyes. We are not in a migration or refugee crisis anymore, although some try to present it as such. And while we are determined to continue reducing irregular migratory flows towards Europe, we also have to acknowledge that some migrants and refugees will continue to come, even if those numbers are much smaller today. This is not something that we cannot handle, but it does become unmanageable if countries have to act alone. It is for exactly this reason that we need predictable and sustainable mechanisms in place.  It is indeed critical for Europe to uphold its moral and human duty while at the same time to have in place a solid, sustainable, future-proof and fair asylum system. This is the essence of our common European asylum reform. Until we get there the Commission is ready to work with Member States to set up temporary arrangements. They will allow us to ensure solidarity with the most exposed EU countries while avoiding creating a pull factor. They will serve as a bridge until the new Dublin regulation becomes applicable.  I said this in December, and I will not stop making this point until we succeed: now is the time to finalise the reform of the European Union’s asylum rules, now is the time for the governments to take up their responsibilities in the Council and stop blaming the Commission.  (Applause) I count on this House’s continued support and before I close my remarks, I would like to express my gratitude to Parliament for its support during all these four years. Thanks to your support and your commitment we are in a position to say that we deliver, but we can do more in the future. But unfortunately the clock is ticking. We are running out of time and we have only three months ahead. Let’s do our duty. Let’s do our job.

In 2016, the Commission pushed for seven proposals to reform the Common European Asylum System. To this day, there are possibilities for political agreement in five of them, but the Community institutions are in the hands of the necessary solidarity and determination.  The instruments contained in these proposals, even on their own, represent a step forward in migration management. Reform of the 'Eurodac' system, the Regulation for the European Asylum Support Office or the creation of a common resettlement framework may succeed if there is political will and political agreement, but further work is needed on reforming the Dublin system as, two years after the Commission launched its proposal, the divergent positions of the Member States continue and have prevented the Council from adopting a mandate to initiate negotiations with the Parliament.  The Union has everything at its disposal to alleviate this crisis: the 2015 European Agenda on Migration, the Emergency Trust Fund for Africa or the Union's External Investment Plan. In addition to the seven legislative proposals, a budget increase has been envisaged in the next financial framework that can reach EUR 10 billion, not to mention the signing of the Global Compact for Migration with the United Nations.  But solidarity and better management are needed to prevent men, women and children fleeing terror, wars or climate change from being left helpless, dying at sea or falling into the hands of criminal networks.

In this context, I refer to the speech last summer by Mr Verhofstadt, the leader of the European Liberals, here in the Chamber on the need to reform European asylum and migration rules. He then blamed the Council for its response to the migration crisis. Verhofstadt argued in the same breath for European centres in African transit countries, where every migrant could apply for asylum, read: a ticket one way to the EU. This is really asking for trouble, because there are about 60 million people on the run worldwide. Europe cannot accommodate them all. That is why we need a limit on the number of migrants we take in. But as long as the European Parliament, like Mr Verhofstadt, continues to approach migration issues from the point of view of open borders, many European proposals for reform on migration will be stranded on the Council's reluctance. Parliament dictates idiotic and unworkable proposals, in the genre of airbridges between Africa and Europe, and then marvels at the refusal of the Member States.  This legislature is coming to an end and many asylum files are still stuck. It's time for realism. The unbridled influx must be limited.

We managed to join five groups in a text that actually points out the need for a truly European compromise.  We voted for a proposal that would ensure solidarity between Member States; where every Member State would play a positive part in correcting the failures of the current system. We improved the Commission proposal by ensuring immediate registration and security screenings of applicants, reasonable balance, easing the burden on front-line Member States and a fair sharing of responsibilities for all. Our text would incentivise applicants to work with the authorities instead of driving them to abscond and make use of smugglers. What I want to see is an orderly asylum system in Europe where those in need of protection who reach our shores would receive exactly that, and those that do not comply with the criteria would be sent back.  We did our homework in this House. What did the Member States do? They dug themselves deeper and deeper into the trenches. All of them seem to worry mostly about themselves and no one is ready to find a compromise.  Now I quote Commissioner Avramopoulos: ‘Open your eyes’. We are all time low on migration at this moment.

Madam President, \"At night, everything is black. I was very scared but I had to get in the canoe. I've seen a lot of people, rebels, shoot anyone. You could hear people screaming, screaming, crying. I thought I was dead.\" This, ladies and gentlemen, is one of many testimonies of a migrant who has survived the Mediterranean. Every day, on the edge of our Europe, humans die for simply wanting to leave hell - almost 18,000 since 2014 If Europe cannot accept all the suffering of the world, it must take its fair share in welcoming those who call for help, especially as it bears its share of responsibility for the causes of migration. Instead, the European Union, which likes to claim itself as the world champion of human rights, does not hesitate to make itself the best ally of oppressive regimes, such as Sudan or Eritrea, or failed states, such as Libya. Today, it is with European money that we finance armed gangs in these countries, occasionally renamed coastguard or security assistants - a deception that will not deceive many people. Because the objective is clear: to prevent at all costs the slightest asylum application from being filed in Europe. This is the clearly announced objective by the Austrian Minister of the Interior last July. And make no mistake: if the latter belongs to the extreme right, his positions have been de facto endorsed by the heads of state and government, both right and left. From summit to summit, they measure, as you did, Madam Minister, the success of the asylum and migration policy alone in the light of the decline in arrivals.  Fortress Europe is an insult to the values of the European Union. This repressive policy makes us complicit in regimes and, dare we say it, murderous regimes that trample on human dignity, at the risk of beginning to resemble them. But is it not already too late when, from Belgium to Italy, from Hungary to France, some governments criminalise migrants and those who help them? More than a year ago, rejecting everyone for itself and simplistic formulas, this Parliament adopted by an overwhelming majority, under the leadership of Mrs Wikstrom, who has just spoken, a position radically opposed to both simplism and populist flight forward.

The lack of legal access routes still leads to the use of human traffickers for those forced to flee war and persecution.

It is the result of Matteo Salvini, italy's interior minister, reluctantly accepting the crackdown on people-smuggling NGOs. The Council advocates the same weak EU policy of returning illegal migrants, while Mrs Merkel acknowledged last week that the Turkey deal has completely failed on this issue.

I wish we didn’t need it, but unfortunately we do. As I said, and as many of you underlined during this debate, this is Europe’s last chance. We shall not spare any efforts. The Commission, and I personally, remain fully committed to continue working with you and the Council to achieve this very important goal: the reform of the European asylum system. I would like to thank you for this clear and loud support. We will continue to work together intensively to achieve the completion of our comprehensive work. To respond to Ms in ‘t Veld, all our proposals are indispensable pieces of a comprehensive policy. I have taken note of your remarks. I know how sensitive you are, and I respect that, but from our side that’s how we see the whole package and the policy we have to adopt. One should never forget that, in the area of migration, all our actions are interconnected and all the pieces have to fit together. Completing the European Union’s asylum reform is indispensable in order to curb irregular migration, to prevent secondary movements, to reduce abuse and to ensure that asylum applications are processed quickly and fairly across Europe. We all agree that cooperation with third countries is key, not only to prevent irregular departures to Europe, but also to eliminate once and for all the cruel businesses run by traffickers and smugglers. Partnership and enhanced cooperation with African partner countries is at the heart of our work. The EU Emergency Trust Fund for Africa has contributed to delivering concrete results. It is also essential to ensure that all coastal states in the Mediterranean are able and ready to comply with their obligations under international law regarding search and rescue. A crucial element, therefore, is also our work on return, both with countries of origin and within the European Union. Last but not least, we need to continue our actions to strengthen and better manage our common external borders. Our proposal for a standing corps of 10 000 European border guards is on the table. This is what our Member States have asked for, and we have delivered. That is why we also need to advance those proposals on which we are ready or almost ready. We have to be ready for the future – an unpredictable future. This is in everyone’s interest. We simply can no longer afford these types of unorganised ad hoc solutions. Now is the time to put words into action.  In this electoral new year, I want to reiterate the message that Europe will be judged on what it delivers for our citizens, as Cecilia Wikström has also said. Our citizens expect a lot from us, and they count on us. I hope we will have a different debate soon, including key legislative files, so let’s move ahead and leave – this should be our goal – a strong legacy for Europe’s future.

The Presidency is working with the Commission and Member States to find an arrangement that ensures predictability, in accordance with the international law of the sea concerning disembarkation, and enables efficient asylum and return procedures. In December 2018, the European Council invited the Council to continue work on the basis of its previous conclusions, that is and I quote here, ‘to seek consensus on the Dublin regulation, to reform it based on a balance of responsibility and solidarity, taking into account the persons disembarked following search and rescue operation’. The Romanian Presidency will therefore take the work forward on this basis. Over the course of several presidencies, intensive efforts have been put into an attempt to find a solution acceptable for all. Different concepts were tested; however, it has not been possible to agree on a compromise. As already explained, it has been clear that the agreement has to be built around the different aspects of the comprehensive approach, and this is the avenue that the Romanian Presidency intends to follow.  As I said previously, we are working to find an arrangement that brings predictability, in accordance with the international law of the sea concerning disembarkation, and enables efficient asylum and return procedures. I welcome the solution found last week on the two NGO ships, with the support of the Commission in liaison with the Member States.  It is of the utmost importance that we succeed quickly, even if only with a temporary solution. The EU as a whole – not to mention the migrants themselves – does not deserve to see this situation remain unresolved. At the same time, we will continue working on reforming the common European asylum system that will bring about a permanent solution to address the situation in the future.

Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, chairmen and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I am pleased to be able to visit you once again in the European Parliament and to present the results of the Austrian Presidency today. We have had an intensive six months, a very dense work programme, but above all very good cooperation with the European Parliament. I would therefore like to begin by thanking you for the good cooperation that we have been able to ensure between the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament over the last six months. Thank you for the good support of our Presidency. During our Presidency, we have always attached great importance to full cooperation with the European Parliament. I would therefore like to express my sincere thanks today to Juliane Bogner-Strauß and to Karoline Edtstadler, who represented us here as the Presidency during the plenary sessions. However, I would also like to thank you all for the 161 trialogue negotiations that took place together, in which 53 agreements were reached. Thanks to the efforts of many in Parliament, the Council and the Commission, but above all because there was a willingness on the part of all those involved to compromise. In the, I would like to thank the Austrian Presidency team, especially our Ambassador Niki Marschik in Brussels, but also Alexander Schallenberg and the two teams in Brussels and Vienna. Since each Presidency is only one link in a chain, I would also like to express my sincere thanks to our trio partners Estonia and Bulgaria. I would also like to take this opportunity to wish the Romanian Presidency all the best for these intensive six months. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for your excellent work. I was here with you in July and said at the time that we should all take the European Union for granted, but must work every day to improve it. Although there are always difficult debates on substantive issues, I said at the time that I believe that there will always be more that unite us than that could ever separate us. I would put both the same today.  As the European Union, we always have the challenge that the European Union's structure is very complex, that decision-making sometimes takes time, often seems almost impossible, but that there is still so much that holds us together, that there is so much that we have to tackle, develop and resolve together, that there is no alternative to this cooperation and, above all, to the will. to find compromises.  I am glad that we have been able to reach some compromises with you over the last six months, and so Hopefully we have been able to move the European Union in the right direction on many substantive issues.  Given the current occasion, but also because of the dimension, perhaps allow me to start with Brexit and the challenges that come with it.  When we were allowed to take over the Presidency in July, we had the ambition to do everything we could to maintain the unity of the EU-27. Today I would like to thank the President of the Commission, but also Michel Barnier, for the careful negotiations. After all, it has been possible – and we have always tried to support this – to ensure that the unity of the EU-27 is still in place today. The European Union, it must also be said, has nothing to reproach itself for in these negotiations with the United Kingdom. We have negotiated an excellent withdrawal agreement that is balanced and even ensured a political statement on future relations. Even if the vote is negative – this afternoon in the United Kingdom – and the next few weeks and months may be difficult, I very much hope that we will continue to be able to ensure the unity of the EU-27, but also to bring about a joint action between the Council, the Commission and Parliament. Austria will certainly do everything possible to support this line even after the Presidency. In addition to Brexit, we have deliberately focused on three key issues under the motto \"A Europe that protects\". Firstly, security and the fight against illegal migration, secondly, prosperity and competitiveness, and thirdly, neighbourhood. Because if we want to guarantee security in Europe, we must also fight for stability in our neighbourhood. On the first area, on security and migration policy, despite the blockade on the distribution issue, we have succeeded in making progress on cooperation. with third countries. In particular, with Egypt, but also with other states, we have succeeded in ensuring that the rescue is no longer carried out only by European vessels, because this is always connected with the ticket to Europe, but that more and more rescues are also carried out by Egyptians, Libyan coastguards and others and that people are transferred back to North Africa after the rescue. As a result, a total of 95% fewer people are arriving in Europe today than in 2015. Most importantly, not only the number of arrivals, but the number of deaths in the Mediterranean has fallen massively. It is now the case that the central Mediterranean route, the Mediterranean route via Italy, is de facto closed. We have had virtually no arrivals here in the last few weeks.  It has been possible to secure an agreement among the interior ministers to strengthen the Frontex mandate: that Frontex will be able to cooperate more closely with third countries in the future, but also play a more important role in foreign transfers. As far as staffing increases are concerned, we remain in favour of all the Commission's proposals and will continue to support them. I would also like to invite you: please talk to your Heads of Government, talk to your governments, there are some who still need to be convinced here. As far as the distribution dispute is concerned, we have tried not to celebrate it any further, but to present a new proposal, namely compulsory solidarity. I would also like to express my sincere thanks to the Commission for the positive speeches on our proposal. In the area of competitiveness and prosperity, the sustainable safeguarding of our prosperity and our habitat, we have focused on the sustainable strengthening of the internal market. I am pleased that the majority of the open proposals in the area of the Digital Single Market have been positively concluded, such as the areas of cybersecurity or the Broadcasting Regulation. We have also dealt with fair taxation of internet giants. It has been possible to bring about a change of opinion in the Council. The real decision-making is still missing, and here too I would like to invite you: please help us to convince the States, which are still somewhat sceptical here. Sustainability is of great concern to us as the Republic of Austria, and I am all the more pleased that it has been possible to ensure a ban on certain single-use plastics. However, the reduction of CO2 emissions for passenger cars and heavy goods vehicles is also a great success for the Council, the Commission and Parliament, because there have been successful trialogue negotiations here.  Protecting the workplace from certain carcinogens or agreeing to set up a European Employment Agency are further steps that I would like to mention here. A truly powerful Europe, a competitive European Union, of course, also needs a modern budget. I admit that, as far as the MFF negotiations, the negotiations on the European Union's multiannual financial framework are concerned, I was very, very sceptical at the beginning as to whether it might be possible to achieve success here. At the request of the President of the Commission, I was then persuaded to get us to work at full speed here, and he was right: it was possible to achieve far more success here than I originally expected. At the end of our Presidency in December, we were able to hand over a full negotiating box. I hope that the negotiations on the MFF can now proceed quickly. In the third area that we have identified as a priority – the Neighbourhood Policy – I, as an Austrian, am grateful that the Western Balkans have now once again become more of a focus for the European Union.  It is nice to see a positive development in some countries of the Western Balkans, such as the resolution of the name dispute in Macedonia, and the opening of two chapters with Serbia and one with Montenegro is a really important sign of the European perspective for this region. I very much hope that Romania, and also the future Presidencies, will continue to maintain the focus on the Western Balkans initiated by Bulgaria. I would particularly like to thank President Tajani for the cooperation within the framework of the Africa Forum. At a forum in Vienna, together with the African Union, we tried to focus more on the economic development of Africa in order to sustainably strengthen living conditions on the ground and also to stop leaving the continent to the Chinese in terms of investment. We have been asked by the African governments, who participated received a very positive feedback and again a big thank you to all who made this forum possible. Finally, it is important for me to raise an issue which, as a Republic of Austria, seems particularly important to us because of our history: the fight against anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism. In November, we held the first European conference on this subject in Vienna with all the Jewish communities from Europe. Council conclusions on this subject were adopted in December. I would like to thank all the Heads of State and Government in the European Council for their support, because I believe that it is important that, when Jews no longer feel safe in some Member States, we as the European Union do not simply take note of this, but fight resolutely against it. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank once again the Commission – especially President Juncker – the European Parliament – above all President Tajani – but also all the other Heads of State or Government and all the Member States for the good and constructive cooperation during our Presidency.  We have always tried to make a contribution to strengthening the European Union, finding compromises and achieving concrete results. I am glad that we have succeeded in this in so many areas, and I can promise you that we, as the Republic of Austria, will continue to play an active role in strengthening the European Union.  Knowing that there is already a bit of an election campaign in the air here, I wish all those who are standing for the European Parliament again in May all the best for the election campaign. I hope that, during the election campaign, there will be an intensive, objective debate on the future of the European Union, because that is what we need. I also hope, however, that this debate will always take place in a respectful tone, because that is entirely in the spirit of a united Europe and, above all, of the citizens of the Member States of the European Union. Thank you for the good cooperation during these six months and all the best of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 67, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Chancellor, thank you for your speech, but also your strong engagement against anti-Semitism.

Mr President, Mr Ambassador, Mr Ambassador, who has played a major role in the success of the Austrian Presidency of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, Mr President- It makes little sense for me to repeat what the Chancellor has said here. The austrian Presidency's record is impressive when one considers the number of agreements reached between the Council, Parliament and the Commission. 134 dossiers were successfully dealt with, processed and negotiated, 73 political agreements were reached with Parliament and 61 with the Council. I have experience in the balance sheet, and I can compare what the Austrian Presidency has achieved with what others who have actually set out with higher standards have achieved, and I find the austrian Presidency's record impressive in every respect, with one relevant exception: I would have liked the Austrian Federal Government to have overcome this autobiographically weakening moment by opposing the , which many of us thought would have given our consent to the UN migration pact. The Chancellor knows – Sebastian knows, because I have wrestled with him on several occasions – that it would have been desirable if the Presidency had gone in the right direction instead of sending out negative signals. (Applause) But the truth is that Austria was not and is not the only country that is opposed to this migration pact. I didn't understand it, I still can't understand why this could have happened. However, with the exception of this, as I always say, autobiographically weak moment, i, as President of the Commission, have no objections to the Austrian Presidency, because I felt that, contrary to many previous impressions, this was a Presidency that served the European cause. In this respect, from a European perspective, I would like to see more presidencies that would be conducted with such stringency, consistency and continuity, as was the case with the Austrian Presidency. I really enjoyed the fact that we, as the Commission, have always been able to rely on the willingness of our Austrian friends to ensure the unity of the 27 when Brexit came about. It wasn't an easy job. Contrary to what one thinks, this debate is taking place not only at European Council level, but also in the expert councils, where Austria has shown a clear edge and followed clear lines. This deserves recognition and praise. I am very pleased that the Austrian Presidency – as Sebastian has just mentioned – has approved the Commission's proposals on the security of external borders. I must confess here that, on the basis of the admissions of the Austrian Chancellor, the Commission has modelled, reviewed and amended its proposal for the security of the external borders. We had originally proposed that we would keep two thousand x 10 000 men on standby by the year. This did not seem to the Austrian Chancellor to be appropriate to the request. But what I am now saying is that the Austrian Chancellor and the President of the Commission are the only ones who still stand by what everyone wanted. And the Austrian Presidency has tried to keep this idea alive in the various Councils. I would like to start by saying that I have the flu, so that is good news for you, because I can no longer speak when my voice is speaking – once again branding the duplicity of the Council. Everyone is asking us to do more when it comes to border protection. We are doing something, we are proposing something together with the Chancellor, and now there are withdrawals. I can only brand it. Either you stick to what you say and ask for, and then you do, or you should keep your mouth shut when it comes to important issues. (Applause) In any case, I am grateful to the Austrian Chancellor and the Federal Government for their maximum support for the Commission's proposals. I am also grateful that, contrary to initial concerns about the employment agency, we have made progress. I remember very well, Sebastian, that I had a sporting conversation with you in the Federal Chancellery and kindly admonished you to carry this topic on. This is what the Austrian Presidency has done, contrary to many concerns, sometimes even its own concerns, and I am grateful that, having a banking supervisory authority, we are now also getting an employment agency. Anyone who thinks of Europe, as I used to say, when I was only It was fundamentally wrong to be a trade unionist. Workers are also entitled to protection. Those who protect the banks must also protect workers, and the Austrian Presidency has helped us in this direction. (Applause) MFF, financial perspectives – the Austrian Presidency deserves praise and recognition. Despite initial concerns – as the Chancellor has just pointed out – the Austrian Presidency has succeeded, which in previous years has never been so early in the case, in filling the negotiating boxes, the negotiating boxes, so that the Council and Parliament – Parliament is somewhat more researched than the Council – now have a negotiating basis that allows us to make progress on financial perspectives. , which we need in order for us to reach potte in October – and this deadline is also a success for the Austrian Presidency. In this respect, I have only words of praise for the Austrian Presidency, knowing how difficult this 'crate boxing' is. I also wonder how to translate 'crate crate' into other official languages of the European Union. What I wanted to say is that the Austrian Presidency has been careful to gather the pieces that it needs in the overall context so that we can make further progress on the financial perspectives. I am also grateful to the Austrian Presidency for its clear words on anti-Semitism. I never thought that it would happen to me in my lifetime that Jewish fellow citizens would have to be afraid to profess their faith. Austria had special reasons to speak clearly about anti-Semitism. I was in Vienna months ago and also visited the Jewish community in Vienna to testify that there is no place in Europe for anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobia. The Austrian Presidency has not only expressed words of caution, but has also demonstrated that we are prepared to defend this negative fundamental resentment, which there is no need to continue. I am also grateful for the Chancellor's Africa initiatives. We had a high-level group meeting between Africans and Europeans in Vienna, as they say in German. This was an important message for Africa, because we need to know – and the Austrian Presidency has repeatedly stressed this – that there can be no European future without securing African futures. And this signal to Africa, coming from the Austrian Presidency, was already very important. So, overall, with the exception of what I said, this was a successful Presidency, and I have to thank the Chancellor, the Federal Government, the ambassador for much of what has been initiated and for successes that I did not think we could achieve at the beginning of the Presidency. Thank you and servus.

A warm welcome to the Chancellor on the balance sheet of the Presidency. We, the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, would also like to say thank you, because the balance sheet is impressive, it is strong. In the last six months, far more deals have been achieved for the future of Europe than we all expected together. And, frankly, politically it is sometimes a pity that we always have public debates on Europe only on crisis issues, that we only talk about what people see as problems on the continent, and that we hardly manage to get the positive issues, the issues that we conclude, that make Europe stronger, to be perceived. It is a pity that this is the case. We, as politicians, will have to live with it all the time. But this Presidency of the Council proves it quite impressively. The political record in the content has been enumerated. On the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to emphasise once again the issue of security. With the defense fund in the field of cyber and drone technology, there are huge opportunities. We have strengthened interoperability, data exchange between security authorities, ECRIS as one of the issues. We have made progress in the area of prosperity, investment screening in Europe is an important point for us, the EU-Japan agreement was concluded during your Presidency, and we have achieved a great deal in everyday roaming, including roaming for bank transfers, so that people can feel it in everyday life. Last but not least, we have taken great steps in the environmental field with the ban on single-use plastics and the CO2 result. That is remarkable. And if people were more aware of what is being achieved in terms of content, we would be better able to communicate Europe. Perhaps more important is to initiate political debates beyond the content, because a Presidency of the Council must, of course, be in management, but it must also provide guidance. And we are concerned about issues such as the discussion on the protection of external borders at the first informal council in Salzburg. Prioritising the management of external borders in the migration debate is central to us as the PPE-DE; it is the precondition for any further debate on migration that we know who is on European soil. The fairness debate with the digital tax and, Chancellor, austria's progress now with a national digital tax to force the internet giants to pay a fair share for national structures is remarkable, is strong. Therefore: congratulations! This priority has been good for Europe. And the discussion of values – Jean-Claude Juncker has touched it: if we are in Europe on a continent where we are seriously talking again about violence against Jews, then it must be prioritized in an accentuated way. I myself was allowed to attend the meeting on anti-Semitism in Vienna, and what the Jewish associations told us there must wake us all up, must alert us all that we are dealing with the issue. The basic message behind this is: Never again! A great deal has been achieved. Congratulations! Finally, I would like to say that Austria has presented itself as a strong country with a strong government. The citizens have also supported it; As I have seen, in the six months they have been proud to be at the top of Europe, to be able to stand and to move Europe forward. That was a good presidency. What remains is that constructive work, leadership and the will to reach consensus lead to a good Europe. Thanks to Sebastian Kurz and thanks to the Austrian Presidency of the Council!

But we can see that the Austrian Presidency was delivering more of another kind of Europe: a Europe of fears, retrenchment and a certain kind of selfishness. We regret this, because we need a strong Europe with strong ambition – so strong and so ambitious that we can provide the necessary solidarity.  This started with the refugee drama. We could have delivered quick, swift operations of rescuing and providing asylum. But we were confronted with several dramatic scenes in the Mediterranean, and we deplored this. Europe needs to define a fully-fledged migration policy to ensure the orderly, organised management of migration – because we do need migration. Instead, we were blocking some of the key pieces of this migration policy.  Then we had the episode of the Global Compact for Migration, which we very much deplore. This was endorsed by most of the countries in the world, and we saw in Marrakesh some of the Member States of the European Union not endorsing it, led by the Austrian Government – something we again deplore and something we just cannot understand. But this lack of ambition and solidarity also has connected with our citizens. Let us take the European Social Pillar – the biggest initiative we have. The Austrian Presidency could have delivered more quickly on the full package of directives and regulations which are necessary to implement the social pillar. We could not understand how it was even possible for the Austrian Presidency to postpone a meeting of the Council of Ministers. We are in a hurry, Chancellor, to implement this pillar in order to turn this into reality. And then we have the important negotiations on the multiannual budget. Yes, this is necessary to meet the new challenges in Europe and also to keep a strong commitment to cohesion. We were really disappointed that, in the last European Council, it was decided that the final agreement should take place only in autumn. This is too late. A lot of regions will suffer from this. We have the conditions to get the basic agreement before this, and we don’t understand why the Austrian Presidency was not able to put forward a more ambitious schedule to finalise this negotiation.  Then we had another opportunity on eurozone reform – something on which we have been waiting for years and years. The solutions are on the table. We might be close to an agreement enabling us to complete the banking union and to create the budget for the eurozone, something all monetary zones in the world have – they have a budget. But again, the Austrian Presidency was hesitating over this. This is a crucial piece to reset cohesion inside the eurozone and to overcome the divergences we have in this important area of European construction. Then tax fairness. Yes, we do need a new digital tax and we need to deliver this in a much quicker way. I must tell you, Chancellor, that from our viewpoint, the Austrian Presidency missed some key opportunities to deliver a stronger Europe, which we need in this particular occasion, because we are confronted with a new movement of ideas, calling for retrenchment, selfishness, a far right movement. In the face of this, we basically have a choice: either we make an alliance with them and make concessions to them, or we present a real fully-fledged alternative – a strong Europe, ambitious and able to provide solidarity.  So this is the way to go for us Social Democrats, and we really think that we need to move to a new phase where this new kind of leadership emerges in Europe.

Let me do just a little cherry picking to pick up just a few of them. I will start of course with migration and security. I have to tell you that it was really refreshing to see a slightly different point of view from the Presidency and the Chancellery than we have heard many times before. You indicated very clearly what many other politicians were hesitant to say, namely that Europe is neither ready nor willing to accept continuous waves of migrants, as it would have an impact on both our security and the internal coherence of our societies. You also came forward with proposals and solutions. For instance, we’ve seen improvements of the Schengen Borders Code or the Entry—Exit System, which will both help to manage migration and help us to tackle illegal migration. I can assure you your message was heard and appreciated, particularly in Central and Eastern Europe and in the V4 countries. Again it was proven how important it is to find a consensus between the Member States instead of arbitrary solutions, like the very unfortunate relocation scheme pursued by the Commission, which unfortunately caused one of the most serious clashes yet between East and West and between new and old EU Member States. I hope that is definitely off the table. You also made it one of your priorities to ensure the prosperity and competitiveness of the European economy, especially through digitalisation and innovation, and you were right. While we have a well—established and functioning start-up culture, the biggest players often come from outside the European Union. We need to do more for start-ups and for small and medium-sized enterprises. In this respect, we need to remove trade barriers. I would also like to congratulate you on the swift ratification of the Free Trade Agreement with Japan, which happened during your Presidency. This creates the world’s largest free trade area, covering nearly 30% of global GDP. I hope that other similar treaties still in the pipeline – most notably with Singapore and Vietnam – will follow soon.  Last but not least, the Multiannual Financial Framework negotiations continued under your Presidency. They are not over yet, and that is good news, because this Parliament and this Commission are finishing their mandate, and therefore they should not decide on behalf of the Member States or Commissioners of the next term. External relations were also a big burden for you. I will not go further into that, but I will end by stating that the Austrian Presidency was pragmatic, non-ideological and not a Presidency of big slogans, but rather of achievable results. This is good news. It was good to see common sense once again prevailing in most of your endeavours, because common sense is exactly what my own group is trying to pursue in this Parliament.

So I will spare you by only saying that I think that that was an efficient Presidency and Austria did deliver as a Presidency on its intentions. But I rather look at always every six-months period of time, not as a Presidency issue but how did the European Union really do, and how have we advanced, regardless of the Presidency? And I think that this needs to be said. This is still a European Union of 28 – maybe tomorrow 27 – Member States where the Presidency has a key role to play, but obviously it cannot perform miracles, but it can help a great deal. I think that the balance sheet, as I’ve said, is pretty good. But if you speak of the number of trilogues, I agree with you: I think this is again a sign of an efficient Austrian Presidency. But let’s look into the legislation that we have enacted: is it really always the right legislation which will really deliver on the three priorities that you had or on the priorities that we will have in the future? I’ll give you just one example. Together with the rapporteur Angelika Niebler, we dealt with cyber security. I think the result is not bad at all. In fact, it’s a good result, and also I must say, even despite some clashes that we had with your ambassador (but that is a normal part of the trilogue), I need to say that it still reflects the lack of change of mind-set in the Member States. We still look at cyber security as an issue where we tack between those who would like to prevail in terms of competences and the rest, and we are as strong or as weak as the weakest part of the chain of the European Union. So that is just one example where I would like to say the numbers matter and you have been efficient, but it also matters what kind of legislation we are able to enact, how the Member States are ready and, of course, how we manage to strike compromises with real ambition. On competitiveness, on digital: yes, again I think that this is significant progress, but still at the same time, if I had the brain (and I don’t) and I invented an application, would I commercialise it in the European Union or would I go to Silicon Valley? And the answer is clear: I still would go to Silicon Valley. So there is a lot to do in terms of the European Union’s ecosystem. Let me just focus on two or three issues where I think we could have done better, for sure, and maybe that history will show also the Presidency. One is on internal security. I do agree with you and I think it was a balanced approach, but still let’s admit that we still have a block in the Council on a number of proposals which are still pending. And we are not facing today a crisis, we are facing a problem, and the moment the crisis would come, we could have significant difficulties on the budget. And I think that again, there is enormous progress – you have ticked all the boxes; the question is: how well were these boxes filled? And I must say I don’t agree with Mr Zahradil, who says that that should be left to the next Parliament. No, I think we have been elected or appointed for the whole term. But I think that he would have to explain, whether it’s on cohesion terms or to farmers, that, when you are really lagging behind, it has an impact on your businesses. But what I would like to say on the budget is that we should still proceed, and that’s maybe one critical remark also to Austria. I think that this is not realistic. I’m definitely against any waste of money, but I think that we need to address the fact that we have new challenges and we just can’t keep, without a serious revision of some of the policies, the budget, and eventually the sum will increase. But anyway, at the very end, I think with those remarks I think that you have done a very good job, but we as the European Union are not yet doing the job that our citizens really expect us to do, and we do fail on some issues.

Many legislative proposals have not progressed and have become stuck in the Council. But what is really going to get stuck with us and what is really going to hang on to the people outside of the last six months is, on the one hand, the very embarrassing courting of Russian President Putin with a knee-jerk fall and all the drums and drums. On the other hand, it is precisely the political caprioles that the Austrian Government has beaten over the UN migration pact, and I have to say that was embarrassing: the Austrian government is actually negotiating this global pact with a lot of passion – I thought – for months. Finally, we have an effort from so many countries in the world to address the issue. So the Austrian Government is doing a lot, a lot of work, and then, after the work that has been done, pretending that this is all a devil's tool. Instead of working together to find sensible solutions, you have polemized and polarized, and you have put yourself in the right-wing nationalist corner, just as Trump and Orban did. And, Mr Kurz, I would say that you have harmed all of us, the whole of the European Union.  And that is not all: you have also shown us all that your government is whistling at our common European legislation when it matters. It is hard to explain otherwise that, in the middle of the Presidency of the Council, you decide to discriminate against EU citizens in social policy and to cut them's family allowance in fact – knowing full well that you are violating EU laws. Other governments are at least waiting for their presidency to be over, you have done the same – well. On the credit side of your Presidency, on the other hand, there is not so much to be seen for the last six months. You have not made any progress in the fight against tax evasion and tax dumping, and on the issue of CO2 ceilings for cars, you have unfortunately also distinguished yourself as a breakdown aide for the German car industry. Unfortunately, nothing has happened with the common European asylum system, and even at Frontex – even at Frontex, it must be said – the equipment has not progressed and has been put on the back burner, and these were also the priorities of the Austrian Presidency. After all, I have to say that we have made some progress in the fight against disposable plastics and I would also like to express my praise for the excellent work done by your officials.  Overall, it seems to me that the greatest achievement of the Presidency of the Council has been that you won the very first prize of the day as 'Fossil of the Day' at the climate conference in Katowice. Congratulations! But I have much more hope when I look at Austria itself, when I look at Austrian civil society. Many people are involved, interested in politics, taking to the streets against the shift to the right, against racism and against social dismantling. And I very much hope that these people in Austria will also be able to send out a signal in the European elections, because Europe needs a cosmopolitan and constructive Austria, and the whole of Europe needs a civil society as you have: a strong voice for social cohesion and against division.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 74, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, Mr Kurz, I am sorry, but I will disappoint you. I do not share the climate of self-congratulation and congratulations. I find it a disgrace to the European Union that Austria, as President of the European Union, has refused to sign the UN Pact on Migration in Marrakech. A Pact signed by 150 countries from all over the world, moderate, balanced, in the preparation of which you had contributed. I would like you to answer your second point: why did you embarrass the European Union, as President-in-Office, by refusing to put your signature on this text? I am not the only one who is telling you this on behalf of the European left. He told you more politely, more elegantly, and Mr Juncker, who belongs to your political group. You have also done nothing about the European social pillar, you have done nothing substantial to promote the Dublin reform package, to which we have long agreed, the European Parliament and the Commission. You delay it and block it. For the pan-European deposit guarantee, the famous EDIS, again procrastination and delay, thus not completing banking consolidation. To tax the giants of the Internet, nothing concrete. For the Multiannual Financial Framework, your job was to speed up the convergences in order to have an agreement before the European elections, because postponing decisions on this issue is damaging the European economy. I am very afraid that your co-government with a far-right party, founded by Nazi supporters in the Second World War, is a decisive influence on you, and that is why I think it is very worrying that such a right-right alliance will also be created at European level after the European elections. Because I've criticized you a lot, I'm going to close with a positive report. I think it is good that both you and unanimously the Council and unanimously the Commission and all wings of the European Parliament support the Agreement of the Prespas is an agreement positive for Greece, positive for Northern Macedonia, positive for the Balkans, positive for the whole of Europe. It is one of the good news that we have, unfortunately few at this time, and I would like to assure you that in the coming days the Greek government, the Tsipras government, is determined to ratify the agreement of the Prespas in the Athens Parliament despite the micro-political, demagogical reaction of the New Democracy and PASOK parties which, unlike the political groups of the EPP and the Socialists, oppose and refuse to ratify the agreement of the Prespas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 75, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Jörg MEUTHEN", "mepid": "190518", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take back from the EFDD Group.

And all this despite a first: so-called right-wing populists were involved in a government for the first time when it held the presidency of the Council of the European Union. This shows that there is a lot of change in the European Union at the moment, and quite drastically so.  The EU is different today than it was before the Austrian Presidency, because there is another novelty: for the first time, a Presidency of the Council has not felt obliged to put itself at the head of the European centralisers. It has been pragmatic and correct and cooperative, but it has not pushed ahead with centralisation. No example shows this better than the treatment of the UN migration pact. We in the AfD put this issue on the agenda early on. But I dare to say that it could never have dominated the debate in Europe for months if Austria had not been so resolutely opposed to the migration pact under its turquoise-blue government. Austria has courageously seerated from the herd of uncritical Jasagers and has thus made the public debate on the disastrous migration pact possible in the first place. Thank you very much for that, Chancellor Kurz. That is why I believe that the Austrian Presidency could one day be seen as a turning point in the history of the EU. I am not the only one who has taken on the defining power of a Presidency of the Council in the European debate. Such a small amount of querulance raises the profile of presidencies. I am sure that the Austrian example will therefore be followed by other presidencies which will set their own priorities. Ladies and gentlemen, a little resistance to the still prevailing direction of the EU does not yet make this government anti-European. On the contrary, not saying yes and amen is not just the right, but the duty of Member States. We must significantly strengthen the intergovernmental part within the EU's institutional framework. We finally need checks and balances that work again, and at last we need a 'no' vote against an EU that, under the leadership of this Commission and also of this European Parliament, is running like a superstate. This 'no' vote, I am sure, will be heard more often in the future, and it will do Europe good, I predict.

As an Austrian, I would like to begin by welcoming the Austrian Federal Chancellor, Sebastian Kurz, here, and I would also like to ask him to take thanks and respect with him to the other members of the Austrian Federal Government, at least on the part of our delegation, because/because this Austrian Presidency was highly professional, it was effective and it was exemplary. For all those who are looking for their hair in the soup here today and are also throwing dirt on this Austrian Presidency: may one thing be written into your family book, especially the ladies and gentlemen of the Social Democrats: the Romanian Social Democrats are also sitting in your group, and if you look at Romania, where proceedings against the top of the list for electoral fraud and corruption are taking place and the murmurs are all around, you are not exactly predestined for this, In the direction of the Greens, who are bringing the Freedom Party close to a regime here, I would also like to say one thing: it was the Freedom Party that co-decided in Austria for the largest restitution boost ever in Austria, and the Austrian model of restitution is now regarded as a best practice model in Israel, but also in the United States. I would ask you, for all the sensitivity of this matter, not to act in our direction with such unflattering reproaches.  I would also like to briefly replicate what the President of the European Commission said, who said that he could not understand why Austria did not accede to the UN migration pact. The explanation is quite simple: because there is a democratic majority in Austria – in the government, in Parliament – because we want to continue to determine our migration policy ourselves and not through a declaration that is supposed to be non-binding, but which says more than 40 times that we are committing to something. Austria would thus also cede a good part of its decision-making sovereignty on this important issue, including with regard to decisions of the Supreme Court, which could also be incorporated into our legal system and which, in our view, would be the wrong way to go. I would also like to point out that, during the Austrian Presidency, the issue of subsidiarity was also very important. There was the great congress in Bregenz. It is a perfectly correct guide, also for the future of the European Union, that this should be shifted back into national decision-making, which is better to decide in the national sphere than in the supranational sphere. The Austrian Presidency has been excellent and may this type of Presidency continue to serve as a model for all those who are still to come.

I would like to thank Chancellor Kurz for his pro-European and pragmatic Presidency. This is an example of how a practical approach to European affairs is more useful than the 'always more inclusive' strategy. It is a good presidency programme, security protection, practical successes in the field of ecology, market protection from internet giants and other things that the Chancellor presented in his speech. This disagreement, which was pointed out with the Head of the European Commission during the debate on immigration policy, also speaks to the fact that there is more sense on the Austrian side, because a solidarity-based policy towards immigrants must be a responsible and realistic policy. A few years ago, the European Commission made a big mistake in imposing a quota programme for the distribution of immigrants, and he, truth be told, has contributed to a very serious decline in trust in the EU institutions and an increase in populism. We should therefore be careful about this. We should have a policy of solidarity and, above all, a realistic one. I think it is worth reflecting on the experience of the Austrian Presidency in this regard. I would also like to sign up to the fight against anti-Semitism, as Chancellor Kurz said, and I hope that this will be a good basis for extending this sensitivity to the protection of religious freedom in the full sense of the word, as well as the protection of the group that is most persecuted in the whole world– Christians.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 78, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Commission.

(projection of a video) Ladies and gentlemen, dear guests, today we are celebrating the anniversary of the twenty years of our currency. The euro is used by 340 million European citizens and is the second most important currency in the world. According to the latest Eurobarometer survey, three out of four Europeans give a positive opinion on the single currency. The euro has made our internal market more transparent and competitive, facilitating transactions, travel, trade and tourism. During the economic crisis, also thanks to the quantitative easing decided by the European Central Bank, and I thank President Draghi for this initiative, the common currency served as a shield, avoiding the collapse of the weakest economies. However, the crisis has also highlighted the failure to complete the euro building and some mistakes made in managing the problem of sovereign debts. It must be acknowledged that not everyone is convinced of the proper functioning of the single currency, and there are colleagues in this House too who criticise the construction of the euro and see monetary union and austerity excesses as a brake on growth and employment. Personally, I remain convinced of the goodness of the euro project, but the euro cannot be an end in itself, it must be an instrument for achieving a social market economy, with the aim of bringing prosperity and work to all European citizens. It is therefore imperative that we finish the building we have begun to build, the banking union and the capital market must be completed as soon as possible, just as fiscal and economic union must be pursued. We cannot remain in the middle of the ford, where we risk being overwhelmed by a new crisis. The most recent data indicate a marked slowdown in industrial growth and production, with the risk of a new recession in some European countries. Economic and social disparities are growing between the different territories of the eurozone, and in some regions one in two young people do not find work. This is totally unacceptable. It is therefore clear that there is still a lack of effective instruments to boost investment, support the real economy, create jobs and stimulate social and regional convergence. It is therefore urgent to follow up parliament's call for a budget adapted to these challenges. My appeal is that today's celebration should not be a mere celebration, where we are lulled on our laurels, but should be an acknowledgeee of the problems that are still open. I call for European leaders to take responsibility for urgently initiating the changes needed to strengthen the euro and relaunch growth and employment, with the aim of giving jobs to as many European citizens as possible, because without work there is no freedom, without work there is no dignity.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 86, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Mr Trichet, former President of the European Central Bank, you have the floor.

Mr President of the European Parliament, former Presidents of the European Parliament, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Eurogroup, chairpersons of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, cher Mario, honourable Members, honorables membres du Parlement européen, je suis très ému, I am moved. I have the memory of my predecessor, Wim Duisenberg, who was there at the very start of the euro. I also have the memory of all the presentations before the European Parliament from 2003 to 2011. There have always been, as there are today, challenging – not to say very challenging – times for Europe. From that standpoint, I would like to stress four successes of the euro. First, it is a success in terms of currency credibility and stability. The ECB was given the primary mandate of price stability by the open democracies. From its inception, it was made clear how its capacity to deliver stable prices should be judged: less than 2% inflation. Since it was founded, the euro’s average yearly inflation has been around 1.75%. It’s better than the former national currencies. The domestic stability of the euro is echoed by its international credibility. The euro is the second international currency after the dollar, far above the third, the yen. Second, the euro and the euro area have proved to be remarkably resilient in the face of the worst financial and economic crisis since World War II. At the inception of the euro, a significant global analysis suggested that the single currency would be short—lived as an audacious experience deserving respect for its boldness but incapable of sustaining the difficulty of hard times. L’euro a prouvé que ces prédictions étaient fausses et il a démontré une capacité remarquable à tenir dans les pires circonstances internationales.  En ce qui concerne la solidité de la zone euro, pour faire brève une longue histoire, je dirai que les quinze pays qui étaient membres de la zone euro au moment de la banqueroute de Lehman Brothers en sont encore membres aujourd’hui, évidemment, y compris la Grèce, et que quatre nouveaux pays y sont entrés depuis le début de la crise financière mondiale, la plus terrible depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Je ne crois pas qu’on puisse mieux prouver la solidité et la résilience de la zone euro. En ce qui concerne enfin le soutien populaire à l’euro, je dirai, comme vous l’avez dit, Monsieur le Président, qu’il est remarquable que 75 % de nos concitoyens approuvent la phrase: «une Union économique et monétaire avec une seule monnaie: l’euro» et que seulement 20 % de nos concitoyens soient contre cette proposition. Ce pourcentage est le plus élevé depuis la création de l’euro, depuis que l’on pose la question. Ce soutien populaire, qui, très souvent, n’est pas pris en compte par les commentaires sur l’Europe, explique évidemment la solidité de l’euro et de la zone euro.  Regarding the fourth success of the euro, I would refer to the last IMF Data Mapper, which suggests that there is no significant difference between per capita growth in the euro area and in the US. The same is demonstrated by the World Bank data: approximately the same growth per capita in the US and in Europe since the setting-up of the euro in 1999. I also think that the euro, as I said, is a process, not an event. One should not underestimate the decisions made since its inception, the reinforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact, the ratification of the Fiscal Stability Treaty, the setting-up of the Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure, the ratification of the European Stability Mechanism Treaty, and last, but not least, banking union. But as you said, Mr President, a lot remains to be done: as Mario says so often, on top of achieving banking union and duly implementing the reinforced economic fiscal and financial governance, I will mention on a personal basis, fleshing out the budget of the EU area, which has been decided in principle, make significant progress in the capital markets union, appoint a minister of economy of the euro area and, last but not least, reinforce the democratic legitimacy of EMU in giving, on the most important issues, the last word to Members of the European Parliament within a framework where you would have the MEPs that represent euro area members. During the whole of my term, I can testify that, in my hearings before the European Parliament, I benefited from the strongest and most important moral support when we had to preserve price stability and engage at the same time on very bold non-conventional measures, including the purchase of treasury bonds from a number of countries in 2010 and 2011 before the decision taken by the ECB under the chairmanship of Mario. The twin messages that I received from the European Parliament were: be faithful to your mandate and deliver price stability; be innovative and bold enough, when necessary, to be commensurate with your responsibilities in times of exceptional crisis. Expressing my gratitude to the European Parliament, I cannot help but mentioning that I looked at the Eurobarometer and I could see that the trust in the European Parliament bestowed on it by the fellow citizens is important, superior of course to the non-trust fellow citizen, and it is better result than what we see for the national parliaments. I mention that very cautiously en passant. Jean Monnet once wrote: «Personne ne peut dire aujourd’hui la forme qu’aura l’Europe que nous vivrons demain, car le changement qui naîtra du changement est imprévisible.»  Nobody can say today what Europe will be tomorrow because future changes, fostered by today’s changes, are unpredictable. I would say that this remark remains true as regards the long-term future of the European Union, but I will be bold enough to say that we already know that tomorrow’s Europe will benefit from its credible single currency, the euro, as well as from its trusted European Parliament.

The euro is the most tangible representation of European integration that our citizens encounter on a daily basis. It is fitting, then, to celebrate this anniversary here with the directly elected representatives of all our citizens.  Over the years here, elected representatives and leaders and elected representatives in other parliaments have rightly recognised that ensuring economic prosperity and stability over the long term is a shared challenge that is best faced collectively. We are stronger together. With the Single Market, we have a powerful engine of sustainable growth to underpin our living standards. The euro has safeguarded the integrity of the Single Market. Today, our economies are integrated to a point that was not imaginable when the euro was designed. Intra-EU exports have risen from about 13% of GDP to 20% today, but especially, value chains are everywhere today in the euro area.  The euro has also produced two decades of price stability, including in countries where this was a long-lost memory. Stable prices have fostered people’s confidence in the value of their savings, which is one of the conditions for prosperity. Based on such confidence, firms invest and create new jobs. Today, most challenges are global and can only be addressed together. It is this ‘togetherness’ that magnifies the ability of individual countries to retain their sovereignty over the relevant matters, sovereignty that would otherwise be lost in the global world. (Applause) It is precisely in this sense that the single currency has given to all members of the euro area their monetary policy sovereignty, compared with the pre—existing monetary arrangements. It is together that we have a voice – and we had a voice – in the regulation of international financial markets, a voice which has been fundamental in reshaping the world financial regulation after the great financial crisis. However, in some countries, not all of the euro’s benefits have been realised in full. Partly, this is because reforms at national level are necessary – and by the way, they would be so under any monetary system – to produce sustainable growth; partly, it is because the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) remains incomplete.  Great progress has been achieved since the crisis struck, but more work still needs to be done; and there is no alternative to a future where we will all continue to work together to make our Economic and Monetary Union an even stronger engine of prosperity for all its Member States.  The European Parliament has had and will have a fundamental role in guiding and designing our European future. In the past, together with the EU leaders, the European Parliament took the fundamental decisions to create the Single Market, and in its wake, the euro.  Today, we are all reaping the benefits of their commitment, of your commitment, and we want future generations of Europeans to benefit similarly from our commitment as well. Today, our duty is to complete what was started two decades ago.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 89, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Jean-Claude Juncker", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Commission President. Mr President, today's event is a surprise event. Remember: many people, when we started the process leading us to the single currency, thought we were crazy, saying that in no way could this monetary union between such disparate countries work. We don't hear them as much today. MPs here and elsewhere, journalists everywhere, law professors, especially in Germany, professors of economics, still in Germany... everyone was telling us that we were embarking on an adventure that would lead the European Union to the brink of the abyss. We are far from the abyss, because today we can see with satisfaction, almost with happiness, that the work we undertaken twenty years ago has been successful. The credit goes to those who were looking to the future. I want to mention two of my predecessors in the various functions that were and which are mine: the Luxembourg Prime Minister Pierre Werner without whom - and without whose imagination - nothing would have been possible, and Jacques Delors, who was a great craftsman of European monetary construction. I could add other names. Many, but not so many, were those who, on the basis of their deep, continental and European conviction, thought that the adventure deserved to be undertaken. Personally, I was closely associated with the successful adventure. In 1991, as President of the Intergovernmental Conference, I and others, including Jean-Claude Trichet, led the process that led us to the Maastricht Treaty. The monetary part of the Maastricht Treaty is a noble, successful part, while the political side was weaker, in fact mediocre. When I signed the Maastricht Treaty on 7 February 1992 - I am the only signatory to the Treaty to still be in political life - I thought that the logic and dynamism of the single currency would lead us to a deepening of political union. Great disappointment, because that was not the case. Just as the economic and social convergence between the different member countries of the euro area leaves something to be desired. I have always considered that the main merit of the success of the single currency belongs to the European Central Bank, since the European Central Bank, whose principle of independence was heavily challenged when we began our work in January 1991, has meant that the credibility of the single currency has never been challenged by the markets or by... (Ringing a mobile phone) He's a Frenchman, I don't know which one... now I know which one... The great debates cast their shadow.  (David Coburn off microphone: \"Mrs. May?\") That was yesterday. Without the independent Central Bank , and many of us had to fight for the principle of central bank independence , the single currency would not have been successful today.  There are weaknesses. I was one of those - along with Mr Delors, Mr Maystadt and Mr Bérégovoy - who, from the beginning, had advocated for the economic government of the euro area. It is a great weakness that the coordination of economic policies is not perfect. It never will be, but we should have done more in terms of coordinating economic policies, including fiscal and fiscal policies. It is a weakness that remains and, therefore, we cannot give up. But we must revive this debate essential for the construction that awaits us. There has been a lot of criticism of eurozone policy. This criticism reaches me very personally because I was President of the Eurogroup at the time of the most serious economic and financial crisis. Yes, there has been reckless austerity, not because we wanted to punish those who were at work and those who were unemployed, but because structural reforms, regardless of the monetary regime in which we find ourselves, remain essential.  I regret that we have given too much importance to the influence of the International Monetary Fund. At the time of the onset of the crisis, many of us thought that Europe had enough muscles to be able to withstand the looming crisis without the influence of the International Monetary Fund. If California is in trouble, it is not for the International Monetary Fund but for the United States of America. We should have done the same.  Similarly, I have always regretted the lack of solidarity that emerged at the time of the so-called Greek crisis. We have not been sufficiently supportive of Greece. We have insulted and covered this country with invective, and I am delighted to see Greece, Portugal and other countries have regained not a place in the sun, but a place among the former European democracies. Es gàbe vieles zu sagen. Ich sage nicht alles heute, weil ich eine gewisse Spannung fer meine Memoiren erhalten mechte, an die ich ja denken muss, und da werde ich auch Ross und Reiter benennen. Ich bleibe der Auffassung, dass die europeische Wàhrungsunion Friedenspolitik mit anderen Mitteln ist - Friedenspolitik mit anderen Mitteln. (Beifall) Und deshalb mechte ich mich hier auch - im Namen meiner Generation - bei denen bedanken, die all dies meglich gemacht haben. Der Euro, die europeische Wàhrungsunion ist der einzige Beitrag, den meine Generation zur Vollendung das europeischen Einigungswerks beitragen konnte. Vieles war gemacht - so gemacht, wie wir es nie geschafft h-tten, wir Nachkriegskinder, die nicht mehr wissen, worum es eigentlich geht. Ich mechte mich hier bedanken bei Helmut Kohl, ohne den dies alles nicht meglich gewesen wre. Denn Helmut Kohl und auch Theo Waigel haben ja die Wàhrungsunion in Deutschland durchsetzen messen. Viele Regierungen haben im 'brigen wegen der Vorbereitung of the Euro-Prozesses ihre 'mter verlassen messen.

It is a pleasure to join you today to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the launch of the euro. The euro is one of the greatest achievements in the history of European integration. Our single currency provides a solid anchor for the creation of jobs and growth across Europe.  The euro has become a symbol of the European identity. It became a popular idea among 340 million people in 19 euro-area countries as it enjoys greater support today than ever before. As the world’s second most-used currency, it reinforces Europe’s presence on the global scene. Many predicted a spectacular failure of the euro, but we proved them wrong.  Not all of the past 20 years have indeed been easy. The financial and sovereign debt crises have put the single currency to the test. Shortcomings in the architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union came to the surface. Still, the single currency emerged stronger from the crises, thanks to committed national policy action and major improvements in the euro area’s institutional framework.  The establishment of the European Stability Mechanism and the banking union has strengthened economic policy coordination, which illustrates precisely this point. Today the euro area is enjoying a broad-based economic expansion, which started in 2013. The outlook is positive. Despite some loss of momentum and some downside risks that have been accumulating. Steady job creation has allowed increasingly more people to benefit from this expansion. The health of public finances and of the banking sector has also been improving. Much has been achieved during these 20 years. Nevertheless, more is needed to ensure that the euro area is well equipped to handle future crises. The Eurogroup has been doing its part. Its work paved the way for an agreement at the December Euro Summit on strengthening our single currency. This was the single biggest reform of the euro performed outside the crisis context. The agreement will allow for a more effective and broader use of the European Stability Mechanism and make our system of bank resolution more credible. Importantly, leaders also agreed to establish a euro area budgetary instrument for convergence and competitiveness. I believe this project can, in time, go a long way towards making the euro stable and inclusive. The work on this file is our priority in the months ahead, but the Eurogroup will continue working on other important issues, such as the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and liquidity in resolution. Step by step, we are increasing the resilience and the smooth functioning of the currency union. Euro area countries and their citizens will thus be in a better position to reap the benefits of the single currency for the next 20 years and beyond.  We cannot repeat it often enough that the euro is not – and never was – an end in itself. It is a tool, intended to increase the prosperity of the peoples of Europe. It is our responsibility to ensure that it lives up to its promise, and even more so in these uncertain times. It is our task to generate a more prosperous society, a more inclusive society, a society with less inequality within each Member State and between our Member States. I just wish to leave you today with the desire to say ‘long live the euro, long live a stronger euro’. Thank you for your attention.

In particular, I would like to pay homage to my predecessors, Karl von Wogau, Christa Randzio—Plath, Pervenche Berès and Sharon Bowles, and I’m pleased to see that most of them are here today.  Since its design, the euro has been a powerful economic tool and an ambitious political project. First, the single currency is an indispensable complement to the Single Market, which has made possible its deepening and has boosted the integration of value chains and the strength of our economies. Second, as President Draghi has just recalled, the euro is a prerequisite for preserving and recovering shared monetary sovereignty, after the crisis of the Bretton Woods order and the development of globalisation, and this is particularly true for the more vulnerable Member States. Third, the euro is a cornerstone of a peaceful and closer union and a global actor after the end of the Cold War and German unification. We will never forget the vision and the courage of Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand and Jacques Delors. In other words, a strong euro is a fundamental condition for protecting and relaunching the European economic, social and political model, faced with the transformations of our time. Ten years ago, when we were celebrating the euro in this House, the financial crisis was about to shake its foundations. That crisis has provided us with two lessons. The first is that, despite being incomplete, the strength and resilience of the euro are rooted in the common political determination to preserve its integrity. Here, the resolve of the European Central Bank and of its presidents has been decisive, and the euro has protected the people during the crisis. We should, of course, be able to distinguish between the euro and the economic policies conducted during the crisis, including some economic policy mistakes which were made at that time. The second lesson is that, if we want to achieve our ambitious goals, resilience is not enough. We need to complement our common currency with a robust, democratic economic and social union. Let us not wait until another crisis happens to develop the necessary tools to ensure stability and common prosperity for all our citizens. The euro is a journey, and it is time to move forward.

On 10 December, the Office again took the decision to delay the entry of the supplementary pension of Members to 65, to reduce its supplementary pension by 5%, to de-index it, and to ask the Secretary-General to consider going further - Secretary-General, who, by the way, earns four times more than a Member of Parliament and whose pension will be perfectly protected. This is all the more anomalous since this supplementary pension fund was created in 1990 by Parliament. Colleagues paid very heavy dues for 15 years, with perspectives clearly indicated to them on the official documents of Parliament. It had already been infringed in March 2009, but with the promise that nothing would change.  The financial difficulties of this pension fund are cited, but it is Parliament itself that is responsible for it, since, when the single status of Members was adopted in 2009, it had decided that there would be no more contributors to the pension fund. The logic would therefore be for Parliament to take over the service of this regime, created by him and with him. All the more so because today, ladies and gentlemen, Members of Parliament have been receiving a new pension without ever having to pay a penny of contributions, and this since the age of 63.

The clear desire on the part of technology firms like Google, Uber and Amazon to dispense with those inconvenient and unpredictable human beings has social implications that are both wide and deep. However, there is a fourth pillar, and that is public acceptance of autonomous vehicles. The traveling public is perfectly willing to accept the notion of autonomous vehicles with a human safety override on passenger aircraft as a matter of routine, but the car is a symbol of personal freedom and status, and it is powerful and it is cherished.

I have taken over the European mandate from Austria and I would like to reiterate on this occasion my thanks to the Austrian Presidency. At the same time, I would also like to thank our partners in the trio, Finland and Croatia, with whom we have had very good coordination in preparing a balanced joint work programme for the next eighteen months. In the following, I will present to you the priorities of the Romanian Presidency of the Council of the European Union and the vision for the future of the Union. Ladies and gentlemen, Europe has always known how to overcome obstacles, to be reborn after the less glorious episodes of history. The European project itself, in its present-day form, has been shaped by the many crises it has been through. Today we are once again at a complex moment in the European construction process but, as you know, any situation of this kind can be turned into an opportunity, into a new beginning. For this reason I tell you that, in my view, Romania's exercise of the rotating presidency over the next six months is not just a formal duty. There are over five hundred million European citizens waiting for an answer about the future of the house they live in, which is called Europe. I therefore believe that it is important to show the citizens of the Union that the European institutions work for them and, above all, that they produce results that improve their lives and prospects for the future. I am aware that the first stage of the rotating presidency will be intensive and reduced in time in terms of decision-making. That is why I am counting very heavily on your support, in order to complete as many legislative dossiers as possible on the European agenda and to respond to challenges at European level. The vision of the Romanian Presidency on the European project is structured around the idea of cohesion, as a common European value declined in all its dimensions: political cohesion, illustrated by the need for unity between Member States; economic and territorial cohesion, with a view to reducing development gaps between Member States and regions; social cohesion, important in terms of preserving the four freedoms of the European Union's internal market. This understanding of the concept of cohesion is transposed in a cross-cutting manner into our thematic priorities, which are part of four main pillars of action: Europe of Convergence, Europe of Safety, Europe - global actor, Europe of common values. The Convergence Europe is the first pillar of the Romanian Presidency's action at the Council of the European Union and aims to ensure economic growth, social development, bridge-building, competitiveness, connectivity and sustainability. The single market is, of course, the union's greatest achievement, the core of European construction. As a result, one of the objectives of the Romanian Presidency is to advance the legislative agenda in the field of the internal market, with the aim of finalising the framework necessary for its proper functioning. We need to strengthen the scientific and technological base of European industry, through which we can boost our international competitiveness and, at the same time, generate growth and jobs. We will continue to promote digitalisation, including in the field of European industry. The digital offensive has already been promoted by the previous Estonian and Austrian Presidencies of the Council of the European Union, and we will also aim to continue to work at the same sustained pace. We will focus on developing the functional links between east and west, between north and south, to facilitate connections of all kinds, to operationalise the four freedoms of movement and to increase the competitiveness of the European economy and the standard of living in less developed regions. I was telling you about the need for a long-term industrial policy, and just as important is the regulation of the Energy Union. These two themes will occupy an important place on the agenda of our presidency. The second pillar of the Romanian Presidency will be the Europe of safety. We are facing security challenges that threaten the safety of the citizen. The European Union faces a wide range of risks and threats that can undermine the values and prosperity of our open societies. In a world of accelerated digitalisation, we need to move forward in protecting citizens in cyberspace. It is necessary to strengthen the Union's resilience to cyber-attacks. Cybersecurity will therefore be a necessary condition for any project relating to the information technology. Also in relation to the security of the Union, we will treat with all seriousness the negotiation and completion of initiatives on the coherent management of migratory flows, the strengthening of the Union's external borders, emergency interventions, the fight against terrorism, the protection of citizens' safety in the virtual space, the operationalisation and even the extension of the mandate of the European Public Prosecutor's Office to terrorist offences, as well as the strengthening of judicial cooperation in civil and criminal matters. We want to contribute to the formulation of viable solutions in these migration-related areas and to promote cooperation between countries of origin and transit, including in combating trafficking in human beings. The third pillar we have set for the Presidency of Romania is Europe - a global actor. In our view, the main direction of action in this area must start from the joint commitments made through the European Union's overall foreign and security policy strategy. In terms of security policy, we will promote the strengthening of the European Union's defence and security capabilities, in close complementarity with similar processes within NATO. At the same time, we need to focus our attention on our immediate neighbourhood, which means advancing the Union's enlargement policy. The anniversary of the 10th anniversary of the launch of the Eastern Partnership this year will be an important moment in this regard. We will also support the implementation of the Union's international commitments. Key milestones are the promotion of commercial interests, the modernisation of the multilateral trading system and the extension of economic partnership and free trade agreements. The fourth pillar on which the Romanian Presidency will be held will be the Europe of common values. In other words, in order to foster European political cohesion, we aim to promote intensively the principles and values that unite us. At the same time, we must firmly combat a number of problems still facing societies within the Union, such as racism, intolerance, xenophobia, populism, anti-Semitism or hate speech. We want a more democratic Union, so we will promote the equal treatment to which all Member States and all European citizens aspire. This is essential for citizens' confidence in the European project. I say this to you from the perspective of the Romanian citizens, whom I represent as Prime Minister and who, despite their very strong attachment to the Union, feel unequal treatment of Romania, especially when our country is criticised for issues that are natural in other Member States or when Romania is subject to certain conditionalities that do not exist in other Union states. Romanians feel inequity when they see that their country is being kept outside the Schengen area, and I want to thank President Jean-Claude Juncker and President Antonio Tajani on this occasion for the full support they give us for joining the Schengen area. I have given you these examples from my country in order to understand that certain decisions that are taken at European level with regard to some Member States ultimately fall to the level of the citizens of those countries and determine, in one way or another, the confidence they have with the Union. So, all the time, when we take decisions, we have to think about the citizens of the Member States concerned by our decisions and we have to eliminate any form of differential treatment so as to strengthen the common values of the Union. Education and culture are the key to Europe's future, both from the individual perspective of the European citizen and from the perspective of strengthening the European project. Solutions are also needed to help young people be involved in shaping a strong Europe based on common European values. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all following the decisions in the British Parliament and it is clear that Brexit will be in the spotlight during the Romanian Presidency at the Council of the European Union. We will turn this tab back on the history of the Union, but we must also learn from this situation. In May, our democracy, the largest transnational democracy, will elect a new European Parliament. I propose that we harness the future electoral context, as it is an opportunity for us who believe in Europe to promote a Union more strongly oriented towards its founding principles, in resonance with our European spirit. I believe in a strong Europe, through unity, in a better Europe, by fulfilling commitments to its citizens and globally and, why not, I believe in a more European Europe, by promoting genuine European values and stimulating citizens' sense of belonging to the European space.

Romania, just like my own country, Estonia, and many others in Europe, celebrated its 100th anniversary last year. It was a time for us all to remember the past, but also to look at how far we have come in that time, and Romania has come a long way. It is now in its rightful place at the heart of Europe, and there is no better symbol of that progress than this Presidency because, over the next six months, Romania will lead the Council of Ministers through a momentous time for our Union.  I was in Bucharest last week, along with all my colleagues from the Commission, to see first-hand the good level of preparations, as well as the enthusiasm for the task ahead. But with a Presidency always comes responsibility, even more so during periods of change and campaigns. As President Juncker has said many times, the Commission is at your disposal and is ready to support you every step of the way. We will work hand in hand with all of the institutions and parties involved to make sure that the next six months are productive, successful and a further factor of unity and solidarity.  But, just as you can count on us, we also count on you. We count on your leadership and stability, and we count on your ability to build bridges and build consensus both in Europe and at home. I say that because any successful Presidency depends, first and foremost, on national unity and political consensus. A united front at home will help a united Europe move forward. Romania knows the power of unity better than most. When preparing to enter the Union, the whole country worked in unison to make sure that it fulfilled all of its accession criteria. This was not a box-ticking exercise. It was the result of a country pulling together, uniting behind the goal of consolidating its young democracy in a union of solidarity and common values. These values – freedom, democracy and the rule of law – are what the country fought for, and these are the values that can never be compromised or weakened anywhere in Europe. We must all show that in the next six months and beyond. I started by saying that with the Presidency comes the responsibility to deliver for all Europeans. That will be Romania’s task in the next six months. It will be harder than usual: there are 242 proposals presented by the Commission that still need to be agreed by the co-legislators, and there will only be a short period of time to get as many as possible of them over the line before this House rises on 18 April for the start of the election campaign. Many of these 242 proposals go right to the heart of what matters, from Brexit preparedness to migration and asylum rules. In my area, the digital single market, seven of the 30 proposals we have made still need to be agreed. These cover issues that make a real difference in the lives of Europeans. It is about making it easier to buy and sell online across borders, about ensuring that we have rights to ePrivacy and can protect ourselves from cyber-attacks, and about having corporate rules fit for the 21st century.  The stakes are high in the digital world and across the world. This is particularly true when it comes to making real progress on the next long—term budget for the European Union. This is not about numbers or decimal points. It is about deciding what kind of Union we want tomorrow. It is our future in figures. The debate on the budget is about showing Europeans that our Union is ready to take its destiny into its own hands.  When leaders meet in Sibiu on 9 May, we should show Europeans a perspective for the future of a stronger, more united and more sovereign Union. There would be no better message to Europeans going to the polls just a few weeks later. I think, in particular, of those who will be voting for the first time. Whether they be in the East or the West, the North or the South, these young people have a lot in common. They are looking for hope, for a brighter more certain future for themselves, and they are looking for a union that breathes with both of its lungs – East and West – and unites people from different parts of Europe. We must reach out to them and show them that their Union will deliver for them.  That is the task ahead of this Romanian Presidency and we are all behind you to make it happen.

The Presidents of the European institutions have given you their full support for the success of the Presidency of Romania. It is what we want here in the European Parliament, too. We have heavy dossiers on the negotiating table with the Council: migration, transport mobility, over forty reports concerning the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework and others. The solutions in these negotiations will foreshadow the future of the European Union in the coming years. As you well know, however, Prime Minister, you have many new ministers who do not have the experience of negotiating with the European institutions. That is why I ask these ministers to rely on the recommendations of the experts from the Romanian Representation, who are very familiar with the dossiers on the European agenda. You have rightly expressed concern that the Eastern Member States are not left on the periphery of the European Union, but as long as, for example, Romania is neither a member of the Schengen area nor a member of the euro area, our country is not fully integrated into the European Union. The Presidents of the European institutions have shown that Romania is ready and will support its accession to the Schengen area, but this is not enough. As Prime Minister, you have an obligation to all Romanians and to business in Romania to meet as soon as possible with the prime ministers of the Netherlands and France, with the chancellors of Germany and Austria and to convince them that Romania is worth it, it is ready to join the Schengen area. In the Netherlands you should also go to the Dutch Parliament, but without the presidents of the two houses of the Romanian Parliament, which are deprived of any credibility, for well-known reasons. With regard to the euro area, as Chair of the National Commission for the Preparation of Accession to the Euro Area, you have decided that you will make public the action plan for this purpose. The year 2018 has passed and we do not yet have such an action plan. Please fulfil your promise as soon as possible.

Congratulations on the start of this first Romanian Presidency. We honor a lot your personal commitment to the European Union. As a former colleague, we experienced you as a very committed European and we see a basis for a very, very good collaboration with this Presidency, given the tasks you mentioned ahead of us and given the serious situation in many, many policy areas.  I listened to your speech with interest and yes, you are right, social cohesion, regional cohesion, is a decisive, cross-cutting issue, and your idea of organising a new mode of European convergence is very much at the core of what we have to talk about. The last hours of this day demonstrate how serious the situation is in London and how much work has to be done, whatever the decision is going to be tonight. The international financial markets, the tax questions – all of that we have to tackle, we have to re-fix, and the migration question is one of the most important ones. Here, let me praise you, let me honor you, because you decided in the Christmas period to join the camp of those who would like to help in the Mediterranean, to help save lives and not to turn a blind eye on what is going to happen or join the club of those who only celebrate their ignorance.  However, let me also point out that we have problems that we need to talk about. Yes, there are things that worry us. Much of romania's justice system needs to be reformed, and corruption must be vigorously combated. If there is a situation in modern Europe where in a country the secret services have influence over the judiciary and the public prosecutor's office, we cannot accept that. I am addressing this here, but I should also address it much more to your President, under whose responsibility the secret services are responsible here on this issue. In this respect, I can agree with the Commission and say that unity is fine, but then let us also call things by their names and place them clearly where they need to be located. If there have been injustices in your country – I am talking about the things that are being collated behind your back and not saying them here, that is not my way of doing – there have been injustices against people who have suffered innocently under the justice system, that must be clarified. But the answer to this cannot be a general amnesty, because it lumps right and wrong. We strongly advise you against this, that is not a basis. But create the rule of law where you think it is necessary. I know that you want that, and I want to encourage you: do this, because you will honour your presidency, you as a person and for your country! And Europe will be with you if you do that. The rule of law is an achievement of European societies that protects people, guarantees freedoms over the state and ends arbitrary rule. This applies to everyone. We Social Democrats know this because we set up for it more than 150 years ago, and we defend it against anyone and anywhere else. But the rule of law is not a cudfore for political competitors to take a back-together stance on the chances of forming political wills. We must respect this everywhere and on all political sides. Prime Minister, you are a courageous woman, I know that, and your willingness to reform can be an excellent prerequisite for the next six months, for fruitful cooperation. I would like to say something to you – to those who always know exactly what it is, especially to competitors from the European People's Party: if there is a country these days where universities are once again closed – for the first time since fascism – if there is a country in which journalists' rights are undermined and freedom of expression is no longer possible, then come to this door. And just because you do not have the confidence to say in the face to Mr Orban what you should say to him: do not brush off your shoes at the beginning of the Presidency! That is the wrong way of dealing with the political debate in Europe. I also said this to Mr Juncker, he knows it personally.

For the first time in many years, the Union is once again expressing its ambition to expand. If they implement the necessary reforms, six Western Balkan countries will be allowed to join by 2025. But the best thing is for the EU to put its house in order first. I am referring not least to Brexit and the growing dissatisfaction among European citizens with the migration policy of open borders.

We are just before the European elections and I have made a little list: the mobility and transport package; the completion of the banking union; the reform of the broken Dublin system; the Multiannual Financial Framework, where we need an agreement, and, last but not least, two Article 7 procedures – one against the Polish Government and one announced by this Parliament against Orbán. There is a lot on your plate. One thing I hope for you and your government is that during your presidency, there will not be a third case of Article 7 – a case against the Romanian Government – because my impression is that by continuing to ignore the opinions of the Venice Commission, you are not far from that at the moment, and there are a few legislative files that are under discussion in the Romanian Parliament. I was in Bucharest together with a number of colleagues here. I met Mr Dragnea, who is the leader of your party and the Speaker of the House, and he defended these legislative files and the attitude of your majority by saying, ‘well, the rule of law is a question of subsidiarity’. I have to tell you, there are many things in the European Union that are a question of subsidiarity, but that is certainly not true for the rule of law. That is not subsidiarity in the European Union. I said exactly the same, that same day, to Mr Tăriceanu and he promised me that your government and both parties forming your majority will change the proposals and will be fully compliant with the Venice Commission. Moreover, he agreed with me that the Venice Commission would have a second opinion once the change is made to these proposals. These proposals – on the restoring of the independence of the judiciary, on the repairing of the Criminal Code, on the repairing of the Criminal Procedural Code and on the changing of NGO law – will be sent back to the Venice Commission.  I have to tell you, very honestly, that since we met each other, with Mr Bullmann and others in Bucharest, not one of these promises has been kept. On the contrary, your government continues to follow the path of bad practices of other governments like Orbán and Kaczyński. I ask you, is the following true? I read in the press that you have a plan to approve a law to grant amnesty on corruption, so that means putting the big fish out of reach of the courts.  So let me tell you one simple thing in this debate: if this were to be confirmed, my Group in any case, and the whole liberal family, will not go into elections with such partners. We want to side with all new clean and democratic forces who want to stop corruption, clean up the country and are also anti abuse of power by the old secret service. That is not criticism of your country or of Romanian citizens. It is criticism of a number of practices of your political majority for the moment, and I think I can be critical of these practices as I am an honorary citizen of the Romanian Republic. I was bestowed that honour in 2001 after I defended in the European Council – and nobody asked me to do so – the interests of Romania in the Treaty of Nice. The other Member States had the beautiful idea of lowering the voting rights of Romania because it is only an Eastern European country, which which was pure discrimination towards them. Finally, we succeeded in obtaining the right thing for the Romanian Republic, the same voting rights as the other Member States. I’m also in favour, Mr President, of Romania’s entry into the euro and into Schengen. Don’t see that as criticism. Pick up this fight. Be the real Prime Minister of your country.

A Presidency is always a time for a country to shine, to show off its skills in diplomacy, its skill in finding compromises, achieving progress, impressing everyone with the opportunities and skills that you have as a government and as a country. The Presidency is a vital job in our institutional relations and for moving Europe forward.  However, a Presidency is also always a time when a country is put into the limelight, and what we discover there when looking at the Romanian Government gives us reasons for concern. Romania has a long tradition of fighting for freedom and for civil liberties, and the people of Romania overthrew a dictatorship after enduring it for 42 years. Romania has joined the European Union and has made important progress, especially against the evil of corruption. Those are achievements that the people of Romania can be proud of; we all should be very proud of those achievements. These days, thousands of people in Romania are out in the streets, asking for civil liberties and good governance, but the problem is that they’re not being heard because instead the government has been organising a backlash against those civil liberties and against good governance, and the proposed law changes will result in legalising corruption de facto. The government is even planning to reduce the rights to protest against that law change or others. A Presidency must lead by good example and with credibility. You still have time to become that good example that we need in Europe, but the clock is certainly ticking. The half year of your Presidency will be quite eventful. We have Brexit coming up – or not – and the EU elections, of course. At the same time, the European Union also needs a long—term vision, so it’s very good that you have planned the summit in May.  However, for the summit to be really helpful, it also needs to include some of the most burning issues that we have in Europe, that we need to solve. For example, how are we going to stop climate change? How are we going to manage the transition to a carbon—free economy? How do we make social rights for people a reality rather than just nice words? How will the EU respond to the backlash against the rule of law in several Member States?

Mr President, Prime Minister, welcome to the European Parliament. The Romanian Presidency will be called upon to manage the deep economic crisis and its tragic consequences, the widening of inequalities, the continuous increase in unemployment, especially among young people, and the poverty of a large part of the world without hope. The statistics for 2017 have recently been made public. One in seven pensioners is on the poverty line, with an increasing trend. It is all this that leads the people to the great challenge of the Union. The European Union and your Presidency cannot therefore ask for the confidence of the people in the run-up to the European elections, unless the obsession with promoting disastrous neoliberal policies, support for the Stability Pact, deepening economic and budgetary union and the logic of austerity budgets are stopped first. Prime Minister, GUE/NGL calls on you to listen to peoples' concerns, to promote the positions of Parliament's progressive forces on the need to strengthen social policy. The social poverty and the break-up of industrial relations which has become the norm require us to invest directly in a social pillar, which has real content on the basis of the needs of society. Because, unfortunately, today it is just a password, without any binding force. Measures must, at last, be promoted and investments made to boost the real economy, bring growth for the benefit of the people and strengthen social cohesion. These are the objectives to be set in the multiannual financial framework. Even digitisation, which is a priority of your Presidency, must be used to create new quality and decent jobs with full employment rights. It is equally important to show practical solidarity with the Member States for a humanitarian response to the crisis and not to strengthen the logic of a fortress Europe.

I am convinced that the Romanian Presidency will be a successful presidency, because we need it to be successful. The European Union is going through an extremely difficult time. Everything I have said and we are discussing needs to happen here, which is why I guarantee you have the full support, and mine – as much as it matters. Because time does not allow me, I will bring up only two topics, which I consider important. Firstly, three quarters of the Member States of the European Union face an increasingly accelerated process of modern slavery: people who are deprived of their liberty, have no rights, their rights are not known. It is not only Romania that is affected, but three quarters of the Member States of the European Union are experiencing this phenomenon. In Germany alone, there were at one time more than 170,000 citizens who were victims of modern slavery. The second very important topic: I am talking about cohesion. Of course we need financial resources. The direct and indirect costs of corruption at European Union level are estimated at almost EUR 1 trillion. Of course Romania is affected and, according to some forecasts, about EUR 40 billion is lost annually, direct and indirect costs. But in Italy about 200 billion euros are lost annually, in Spain there are 120 billion and so on. So a thousand billion is money that we can recover and use at European level for that cohesion that you are talking about.

So let me tell you what our expectations are, our wishes for the kind of Europe we’d like to project using the Sibiu summit. We think that you are coming up with the right priorities. In order to have strong unity among Europeans cohesion is certainly the key word – as you said: economic, social, political cohesion. We are with you in this central priority and you can turn this into something very concrete. The first thing is a social pillar translated into European law and powerful European financial instruments. The second thing is a pre-agreement on the multiannual budget, on which cohesion is a central concern, both for all EU Member States and the eurozone. Then there is a third very important issue: yes Europe is counting on the European border, hopefully with Romania already included in the Schengen area. The fourth one is better partnerships with all our neighbouring regions, including our course Eastern partners, which are very dear to us. And then if we manage all these issues it will be easier to manage migration properly. Finally, if we have this kind of Europe we will have unity whatever happens with Brexit.

The issue of the social pillar, which is one of the four pillars that the Romanian Presidency has put as the basis of its programme and which I believe can be a 50-qualified element in the action of Europe's capacity at this stage that is so critical for the European citizens of so many countries. In some countries, the social tension that feeds our citizens is more evident, in others it is more subsopiled, but everywhere there is this demand for a Europe that approaches needs, starting with work, starting with welfare, starting with children. My group is particularly insisting on child guarantee.  The other aspect is that of industry. I see them together because a Europe that grows more is also Europe that can be closer to demands and needs.

Finally, if we want a fair and equal Europe for all its members, I hope that 2019 will be the year of an CVM-free Union for Romania and Bulgaria and with a strengthened Schengen area, through the full integration of Romania and Bulgaria.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 182, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Andrus ANSIP", "mepid": "124696", "text": "   Vice—President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Prime Minister, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I would like to thank all of you for this very intense debate.

To be honest, I expected proposals, I expected solutions, a positive approach, so that all European citizens who today look to us, see answers to the problems that concern them, answers to the problems that exist for different social categories, for different regions and for different countries. As I said in a previous speech, I did not come to account for certain things. We have come here, to the European Parliament, as Prime Minister of Romania, to find together solutions that will make a strong European Union, a European Union that is much closer to the citizens of all the Member States. I would like to thank the Vice-President for his kind words, for the trust that the Commission places on the Presidency of the Council of the European Union held by Romania. We need your support and I am convinced that, together with the European Commission, the European Parliament, we will ensure stability and consensus for the dossiers and challenges we have on the European agenda. I'm going to try to answer some of the issues raised. Mr Stolojan, new ministers have experience. They secured the Presidency from the shadows and contacted both the Chairmen of the Committees of the European Parliament and the Line Commissioners on each area. We are certainly supporting the General Secretariat of the Council of the European Union. Please do not leave with a preconceived idea that Cabinet ministers do not manage the files or that they will not be able to give positive answers to the problems they have to solve. For your part, as a Romanian, I expected you to trust the romanian ministers and Romania's capacity. You tell me about the meeting and the Prime Minister's obligation to meet with the prime ministers of France or the Netherlands. I have every openness to do this, I have every openness to go to the Dutch Parliament and I have every openness to tell the President of Romania to address these topics in the European Council, because he is attending the European Council. On the euro area: the plan for joining the euro area was finalised in December 2018, is already printed and includes the steps we need to take in this direction. So, we have kept our word and, if you want this program, we are at your disposal to offer it to you. We thank the President of the S&amp;D group for his support and guarantee that we support the rule of law but, at the same time, we also support human rights, we also support the rights of those who have suffered as a result of wrong decisions by the judiciary. Mr Verhofstadt – I'm sorry he left here. I want to assure him that we know the files and challenges that we face. That is why we have asked for consensus, because we need codecision, we need consensus and we will work in this direction. At the same time, I expected a political group leader to come up with assessments on the European Agenda, not on the internal issues of a country that has just taken over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. For credibility, I think we need to speak in good conscience, and I would like to know from Mr Verhofstadt what he is reproaching the Romanian Government. At the same time, I call on Mr Verhofstadt to let the Romanians decide for themselves, to believe in their honesty and not to try to induce their own beliefs towards the Romanians. And my colleagues, I am convinced that I can come up with suggestions for other countries, but I believe that we must let every people and citizens of every people believe, choose and have their own beliefs. Mrs. Keller, you say that thousands of Romanians took to the streets for good governance. I think you've been misinformed about good governance. I just want to give you a few figures, showing what good governance means in Romania: we have economic growth above 4%, economic deficit 2.92%, unemployment below 4%, investments in Romania increased by more than 10%. I believe that this means good governance, and I believe that the misinformation of some colleagues in the European Parliament has induced this perception. If you want, we send you all the figures and everything the Romanian Government has done to ensure an increase in living standards and good governance for Romania and for Romanians. I think you should also compare it with the results of other countries, and perhaps then you will see that Romania has a government that knows what to do and that has been concerned with the problems of Romanians and Romania. Mr Paksas asked us why the interest in the unification of the European Union has been replaced by that of the division of the European Union. I think it's a question we all have to ask ourselves. I think we need to work harder and we see what unites us and see less and appreciate less what divides us, because only together, united, only through cohesion, can we take important steps for the European Union. I want to thank Maria João Rodrigues for her very kind words and, indeed, the Sibiu Summit will give us the opportunity, together, to shape the future of the European Union. I believe that to talk about the future of the European Union is to find together, regardless of the political group and all the European institutions, the best solutions that bring us closer to the citizens, so that we have a united future and a best future for the citizens of the Union. Mr Hökmark, the government must fight corruption. Amnesty – I have said many times: I have no normative act on the government table on this. We don't want to protect anyone, we just want to protect citizens whose rights have been violated. I would be very happy that, when we talk about the rule of law, when we talk about justice, we will all fight corruption – and the Romanian Government will do so – but also protect the rights of citizens who have been affected by justice decisions, secret protocols between justice and the secret services. Those who are now loudly suing that they are fighting corruption, that they want to fight for the rule of law, many of them want to hide what actually happened in Romania and, in fact, were part of this system that led to human rights violations. Mr Marinescu, your position against the Romanian Government is unjustified. You said there were attacks by the PSD-ALDE government against justice. I do not remember and no one, no Romanian, i think can say that the Romanian Government has taken a decision against justice. All laws on justice have been passed in the Romanian Parliament, and the Romanian Parliament is the expression of the vote of Romanian citizens. You have spoken of European funds. I think you were referring to the technocratic government, because we, during our government, recovered in a year. We have 26% absorption of European funds, not counting agriculture, compared to 27%, as the European average. I believe that the fact that this government is on the side of the Romanians is proven by the measures we are taking and not by those who voted here in the European Parliament against their own country. Mrs Bresso, indeed, territorial convergence is very important and no region should be left behind. Rural areas, peripheral areas, mountain areas – we will receive with great openness all the suggestions, in order to advance this topic on our agenda. You told us that twenty million young people will vote for the first time and what we can do to convince them to come to the polls. First of all, we need to show that we have solutions for them. Secondly, we must show that our dispute is not between political groups, between citizens – often of the same Member State – and that our disputes and that our solutions are for them, that we can bring added value and that they must be found in the decisions we make in the European institutions. I think, I trust that together we can do this. I trust MEPs, I trust the European Commission, I trust the Council that, together, we will be able to give in the next six months the answers that these twenty million young people expect, the answers that the more than five hundred million European citizens expect. Mrs Járóka, you are telling us that we are a poor state and that we must do something in this direction. In the last year, that's exactly what I've done. I've raised my standard of living. We have seen that austerity is not a solution for our country or for other Member States. I've raised wages. I've increased pensions. I've increased doctors' salaries. I've increased teachers' salaries. I've increased benefits for disadvantaged people. We invested in the countryside, in the small towns. It is precisely these things that I think we need to do, so as not to talk about poverty, beyond the decisions that we have to make together, at European level. Last thing: the last question I want to answer – in fact, the latest accusations – I have thought a lot about whether or not it is worth giving this answer, but I think that citizens need to distinguish between a hostile attitude and an open attitude. Mr Preda, the Romanian Government and the Prime Minister of Romania do not criticise the European Parliament and the European Commission. I was an MEP and I have always supported the pro-European attitude. After nine years in the European Parliament, in which I have not made a scandal, like you, in which I have united with all the positive solutions for the European institutions, I cannot stand against these institutions. I criticised the resolution, because I believed and I think we need to have this unity of Able. You spoke about the protests in Romania on 10 August. What about the protests in France? What attitude do you have? I am not going to refer to this, because France is taking its own decisions, but France – and no other MEP in France – has come to criticise its own country here in the European Parliament.

There are, however, a few shadows at this festive moment. For several months there has long been a suspicious discussion of Romania's \"inability\" to exercise this mandate. It went to the point where, more jokingly, more seriously, another country offered to take over this mandate, so that Romania could better prepare for another term. Even at the debates on Tuesday, 15 January, there were interventions by MEPs, obviously motivated by electoral interests.

As always, it's a pleasure to have you in this house. And I would like to begin my speech by thanking the shadow rapporteurs and all the colleagues for their great support and cooperation in order to be able to present what I think is a good report. The euro has turned twenty, and it does so at its most popular time. Three out of four citizens think it's beneficial to our economy. What started out as the common currency for 11 countries is today for 19 and 340 million inhabitants. And besides, the euro reaches its twentieth anniversary after a great year. In 2017 the European economy grew at its strongest rate over the past ten years. But more importantly, all Member States saw their economies expand. And we must recognise that this is due both to the monetary policy of the European Central Bank and to the structural reforms carried out by many Member States. The latest data published by Eurostat in July last year shows us that we are going in the right direction. Economic growth for 2018 and 2019 is consolidated above 2%. Unemployment is basically at pre-crisis levels of around 7%, while the number of people employed and the eurozone labour market share ratio is at its highest level since the creation of monetary and economic union in 1999. But it's not all positive. I am alarmed by the lack of upward convergence and the tendency of some Member States not to address their structural deficits. As far as inflation is concerned, the European Central Bank, whose statutory independence is fundamental, and I repeat, is fulfilling its mandate to keep inflation below, but around 2%. In the medium term, inflation is expected to remain around 1.7% by 2018, 2019 and 2020, which is undoubtedly thanks to the measures taken. We have also seen an improvement in credit to the private sector, which, in mid-2018, increased at a rate of 3% per year. That said, we have to be cautious because of the uncertainty that is emerging around the European Union with the resurgence of populism, negotiations and possible consequences of Brexit and protectionism, among many other risks. We must focus our efforts on the essentials, which is nothing more than ensuring that we remain on the path of economic growth and job creation, which is true social policy. To this end, it is key to maintain a scenario conducive to public and private investment, bringing it to its pre-crisis levels. In this respect, greater action is needed by the ECB to ensure that its monetary policy achieves the objective of restoring credit to the real economy, particularly SMEs, which are the backbone of our economy, and that monetary expansion measures benefit the whole of society as a whole. In the report we have prepared and will vote tomorrow we have taken up all aspects of the European Central Bank's monetary policy, taking the measures that had to be taken, but also welcoming the decision to progressively reduce these measures, provided that the economic situation permits. We highlight the potential interest rate hike, the reduction of the asset purchase programme, liquidity auctions, the launch of the corporate bond purchase programme and, of course, the public debt purchase programme in the euro area. But I would like to stress that the European Central Bank cannot solve the structural problems of the Member States. It is the Member States, in cooperation with the European institutions, that must act at national level to establish a solid foundation on which to establish the European Union. The ECB's measures are transitional in nature, and their main advantage is that they give Member States time to consolidate their fiscal situation and implement structural reforms that will create the conditions for continuing on the path of economic growth, something we are all involved in.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 200, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Mario Draghi", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Central Bank. – Mr President of the European Parliament, Mr Vice—President of the Commission, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I am very pleased to be here to discuss with you the ECB’s activities and your draft resolution on the ECB’s Annual Report 2017. Twenty years ago, on 1 January 1999, the euro was officially introduced and the Eurosystem started its monetary policy operations. Establishing a single currency area between 11 European countries was a historic step for our continent and certainly a quantum leap in our economic integration. Its twentieth anniversary gives us an opportunity to reflect on its successes, but also to consider what still needs to be done for the euro to deliver its full benefits.  In this context, I would like to use my remarks to take a look back at the ECB’s monetary policy, to take stock of what we have learned and to highlight the challenges that remain. I will mostly focus on the past seven years, which coincide with my term as ECB President. The two decades in which the euro has existed could hardly have been more different. The first decade was the culmination of a thirty—year period of macroeconomic stability – the era known as the ‘Great Moderation’. The second decade then produced the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. Naturally, these periods required very different monetary policy responses and different tools to implement them.  As the pre—crisis period was characterised by moderate swings in the economic cycle, the ECB was able to ensure price stability mainly by adjusting its policy rates. But the crisis of 2008 fundamentally changed the economic and financial landscape in which we operated. New instruments became essential to safeguard the effectiveness of our monetary policy and stabilise the euro area economy. This in turn required us to refine our approach to central bank communication and accountability. When I arrived at the ECB in November 2011, the euro area faced a very challenging set of circumstances. The economy had bounced back from the post-Lehman crisis in a similar manner to other jurisdictions. But, from 2010 onwards, a loss of confidence in the sustainability of sovereign debt had produced a vicious circle of rising borrowing costs, financial fragmentation, and contracting economic activity. Cuts in key ECB interest rates were not being passed on to firms and households to the same extent in every euro area country. We were witnessing a serious disruption in the monetary policy transmission mechanism which, if left untended, would have posed a profound threat to price stability. The ECB responded with two sets of policies. First, central bank liquidity was made available to banks for up to three years and a range of collateral that banks could use to access central bank money was expanded. This helped reduce fragmentation in banks’ funding conditions. Second, the ECB announced what we called outright monetary transactions (OMTs) in the summer of 2012, which removed the redenomination risk in government bond markets stemming from fears of a possible euro break—up. Yet the sovereign debt crisis left a deep scar on the economy. Unemployment rose steeply, firms cut back on investment and loan delinquencies increased. Even though financial fragmentation was diminishing, banks began to shrink their balance sheets and became less willing to lend. This produced a renewed cycle of contracting credit growth and weak demand dynamics. Inflation drifted downwards. With inflation now well below our objective, the ECB faced a new type of policy challenge. We needed not only to repair the transmission problems created by deleveraging banks. We also needed to expand our policy stance to counteract deflationary pressures. So, in June 2014, we launched our targeted long—term refinancing operations, which once more provided long—term liquidity to banks – but conditional on extending credit to the private sector. We introduced negative rates on excess reserves to further encourage banks to lend to households and firms and, soon after, we announced our asset purchase programme (APP), buying asset—backed securities and covered bonds. Faced with a continued decline in inflation and a heightened risk of de—anchoring of inflation expectations, in January 2015 we expanded the asset purchase programme to include public sector securities. Since then, both the size and duration of our asset purchases have been recalibrated in response to changes in the inflation outlook. Our asset purchases have also been complemented by further cuts in policy rates and the use of what we call ‘forward guidance’. Communicating our expectations about future policy, along with the conditions that would warrant a change in the policy stance, has successfully contributed to reduce the uncertainty around the expected future path of short—term interest rates, thereby helping to preserve accommodative financing conditions.  Supported by these policy measures, the euro area economy has steadily recovered. We have now seen 22 consecutive quarters of economic growth. There are 9.6 million more people in employment in the euro area than there were in the second quarter of 2013, which was the worst point of the crisis – so in five years. The unemployment rate has declined to 7.9%, its lowest level since October 2008, and the employment rate of people aged 15-74 has risen from 54% in 1999 to 59% in the second quarter of 2018, the highest rate ever recorded in the euro area. The main motor of the recovery has been the domestic economy, driven by a strengthening in domestic demand and improving labour markets. That underlying strength of the economy has underpinned our confidence that inflation would converge towards our inflation aim in a sustained manner. As such, since 2017, we have gradually reduced the monthly pace of net asset purchases. We decided to end our net purchases in December last year, confident that the sustained convergence of inflation to our aim would proceed. At the same time, recent economic developments have been weaker than expected and uncertainties, notably related to global factors, remain prominent. So there is no room for complacency here. A significant amount of monetary policy stimulus is still needed to support the further build—up of domestic price pressures and headline inflation developments over the medium term. Our forward guidance on key ECB interest rates, reinforced by the reinvestments of the sizeable stock of assets we have acquired so far, continues to provide the necessary degree of monetary accommodation for a sustained convergence of inflation to our objective. So what have we learned from our experience? The ECB’s monetary framework rests on three elements: a clear mandate to achieve price stability; independence over the instruments we can use to achieve our mandate; and a strong accountability framework. The importance of each of these elements has been reinforced by the crisis. First, we have seen that a well—defined mandate is vital for our credibility with the public, because it guarantees that the ECB will always act in the interest of the whole euro area and will not be swayed by interest groups.  Second, we have seen that instrument independence is key to an effective monetary policy since it allows the central bank to act quickly and flexibly to shocks, especially in exceptional times. Indeed, a well—equipped toolbox, comprising both standard and non—standard instruments, has proven indispensable in conditions where monetary policy transmission is impaired or where space for interest rate cuts is limited.  Third, we have seen the importance of a strong accountability framework, particularly when central banks have to use new tools that are not well understood by the public. Central banks are powerful and independent, but they are not elected. The combination can only be squared if they are held accountable by elected authorities.  In light of this, we have stepped up our efforts to improve our communication and strengthen our accountability in recent years. The Governing Council has started to publish the accounts of its monetary policy meetings. The ECB and the European Parliament have increased the intensity and focus of their exchanges. All this has provided us with more opportunities to explain our decisions and demonstrate how the ECB is acting in accordance with its mandate, which is a fundamental pillar of its legitimacy. The crisis has offered many lessons beyond monetary policy too. The euro area entered the crisis with an incomplete institutional and regulatory framework, not only for the banking sector but also in other areas of economic policy. The creation of the banking union and the European Stability Mechanism has strengthened the ability of the EU authorities to intervene decisively in future crises. Reforms at national level and the strong political commitment to the euro shown by European policymakers were equally instrumental in strengthening the foundations of our common project. But the necessary changes took time and it was time that the euro area lost in its recovery. Our monetary union is now in a better shape, but further progress can, and should, be made.  As I had the opportunity to discuss during my regular hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and as your draft resolution points out, the priority now is to increase the resilience of the euro area. This would also strengthen the transmission of monetary policy in future downturns. Resilience depends on the euro area being able to use a broad policy mix involving monetary, fiscal, prudential and structural instruments. Let me now conclude. The first two decades of the euro area have seen an evolution in the way the ECB conducts its monetary policy. Faced with unprecedented threats to price stability, the ECB adapted its policy instruments to continue delivering on its mandate. We will continue to do so if and when needed, in compliance with our mandate as defined by the EU Treaties, and with all the independence over our tools as defined by our legal framework. Today, we can say that the euro area has emerged from a crisis so severe as to threaten at times its existence. We are out of it primarily because of the resilience, the energy, and the entrepreneurial capacity of European citizens, as well as their trust in their leaders’ commitment to the euro. Our policy response and the important changes to the architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) in the meantime also helped the euro area out of the crisis. In many ways we have a stronger monetary union today than we had in 2008. This is also reflected in the euro’s popularity among euro area citizens, which is currently – as I was reminded a moment ago – at its highest level since it was introduced. But more work is still necessary to complete the EMU so as to make it more resilient in the face of future crises. To deliver its full benefits, the European Union requires permanent political commitment, at both national and European levels, and across policy areas.  In this respect I can testify to the essential role the European Parliament has played during the challenging years of the crisis and I am certain that it will also be fundamental in carrying out the remaining work until the completion of Economic and Monetary Union.  The credibility of the ECB rests on its independence and this is based on its accountability with respect to its mandate, as enshrined in the EU Treaties. The European Parliament, in holding the ECB to account, gives legitimacy to its independence.  Since this is my last hearing before this plenary as ECB President, let me thank all of you for how this process has been carried out during my mandate, for the valued interactions with you, and the opportunity you have given me to explain the ECB’s policies.

It’s a pleasure to be here to discuss it with you and Mario Draghi and that is all the more true in the context of the 20th anniversary of the euro. In those twenty years the euro has proved itself a successful currency which is widely supported by people. Around three—quarters of Europeans think that having the euro is a good thing for Europe. A debate on the European Central Bank’s activities by the European Parliament is an important manifestation of democratic accountability. Let me start by saying that the Commission largely shares the general thrust of the report discussed here today.  The Commission shares the report’s views that the ECB’s independence in the conduct of its monetary policy as enshrined in the Treaties is crucial to the objective of safeguarding price stability. Independence and accountability are intertwined and the Commission also acknowledges the European Central Bank’s efforts to improve transparency and democratic accountability vis-à-vis European citizens and the European Parliament.  We also share the view expressed in the report that monetary policy alone cannot sufficiently achieve sustainable economic growth and that the euro area economy should be supported by a mix of ambitious, socially balanced, growth—friendly and productivity—enhancing structural reforms and fiscal policies in line with the Stability and Growth Pact. Allow me also to welcome the call in the report to accelerate the Capital Markets Union in order to deepen financial integration. This will help in building up resilience to shocks and making the transmission of monetary policy across the Monetary Union more effective. The Commission shares the report’s view that deeper and better connected European capital markets, which will result from the Capital Markets Union and from the step—by—step completion of the banking union, will foster the international standing of the euro. This point was also emphasised in our Communication on a stronger international role for the euro that we presented on 5 December 2018.  I have no doubt that today’s debate will confirm the constructive engagement that has been developed between the European Parliament and the European Central Bank over the past years.

Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Mato for his good report and the President of the ECB for explaining what are broadly positive trends in this 2017 annual report. I note, for example, that you are satisfied, and you write this in your report, that many banks use these better times to make their balance sheets healthier. The percentage of bad loans has indeed fallen and you give all the figures. Unfortunately, however, there are still exceptions, and I am therefore proud that, together with Mr Gualtieri and together with a very constructive Council, I have managed to draw up for the first time rules that will now oblige all banks in the EU to deal with bad loans. Finally, I'd say. Then we must now, and the ECB rightly points out, tackle the already bad loans that already exists.  Finally, perhaps EDIS, because that is also the subject of Mr Mato's report. I think that the recent developments concerning the Carige bank in Italy illustrate well the concerns that are still alive in this debate. Although private Italian DGS is used where possible in this crisis, not to compensate account holders, but to provide the bank with capital. We know that this early intervention is permitted under certain conditions, but we also know that one country uses it more than the other, with the result that the bill is being shifted back to the taxpayer. That wasn't supposed to happen. This explains the deadlock in the Council. This explains why some countries have little appetite to create an exclusively European DGS. Why make a European pot of money when countries deal with it so differently? I think that as rapporteur of EDIS is a very legitimate question, but I think we should get out of this because at the end of the day we are better off in Europe with a solution and not a deadlock. As rapporteur, I have therefore also proposed a system that leaves responsibility for the national DGS first and then regulates the solidarity of a European DGS. I therefore have a very specific question for the President of the ECB, who has always been a strong supporter of EDIS. What do you prefer at the moment: a cautious start to the report as proposed in ECON or wait for the next Parliament to deal with this difficult issue?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 204, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Luigi MORGANO", "mepid": "124788", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank President Draghi for being here and the rapporteur, Mr Mato, for the positive work he has done in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. Without going into the details of the report, I would like to stress the importance of debating and adopting this report on the day when Parliament celebrates the twenty years of the euro, a work of integration that is not only significant economic and monetary, but in some ways truly unprecedented.  The euro is undoubtedly a success in European history, but it is also an incomplete construction. The incompleteness of monetary and banking union with the lack of a fully European deposit guarantee system and the lack of a social and fiscal arm of monetary union with its own budget are the most visible and critical weaknesses. Some people in this House and outside turn their noses up when they hear these assessments, almost getting up, if I may put it that way, at the end of austerity, underestimating that solidarity and responsibility go hand in hand. There is never enough national responsibility for them. In too many circumstances, every time, further steps have been added to be taken, creating and soothing internal divisions within the Union, as a result, we are still, twenty years after the creation of the euro, discussing at technical level Edis, the eurozone budget, social rights and I will stop.  And the spirit in which we conducted the debate on the ECB's annual report in the ECON Committee is this, aware of the fundamental role that the institution that you, President Draghi, preside over, has played very well. I therefore appeal to my parliamentary colleagues, to European leaders, not least in the light of the disappointing outcome of the last European Council in December. The extraordinary monetary policy measures put in place by the ECB have safeguarded the resilience of the eurozone, but our fellow citizens have nevertheless suffered from the crisis, Europe has not been able and still cannot respond to the request for protection.

Mr Draghi, ten years ago the financial crisis arose. The crisis got out of hand in Europe because of too much debt and too cheap money. And what is the ECB's response? Even more debt and even more cheaper money. As we read in this report, this has major consequences. Insurance and pensions are getting into trouble. Property prices are rising super fast and houses are becoming unaffordable for ordinary people. We are seeing huge increases in debt from businesses, families and, in particular, governments. Structural reforms in the countries that need them most now are being postponed.  And on top of that, another clear effect of your policy: interest rates are so low that our savings evaporate. It's not going to pay off anymore. You are going to let the common man in the street, the people my age who have nothing to do with the crisis that started in 2008, pay for the mismanagement of the banks and governments.

Mr President, Mr President of the Central Bank, dear rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, as our Parliament draws to a close, we will vote on the Central Bank's report. Happy combination of circumstances, we celebrated this morning the twentieth anniversary of the euro, and it is an emotional moment, Mr Draghi, since this is your last presentation to the European Parliament. The messages of this report are numerous. I think I can say that the European Central Bank has fulfilled its mission more than properly, especially during the second decade. Of course, the European Central Bank cannot do everything, and Member States are called upon themselves to be vigilant about public spending, its control and good direction in the service of citizens and the competitiveness of the economy. The European Central Bank will remain vigilant about many problems: the level of prices in the housing market, the loans made by banks - made intelligently - with a priority given to future investments. I think that the recognized success of the euro is a wonder because, twenty years ago, we created a currency without a state, and it is a unique situation in the world. This is to say how urgent it is to give the euro area the economic, financial, budgetary and social government necessary to fill an original infirmity as soon as possible. While multilateralism is being called into question, and the world economic war is looming, I think it would be good if we had the ambition to make the euro a weapon, as the United States does, namely that it can, in certain circumstances, sanction banks and third-country companies. Ladies and gentlemen, in these times of crisis, the euro and the European Central Bank are making a major contribution to the resilience of the European Union. Euro and the European Central Bank are emblems of our confidence in the future of Europe.

The Irish Central Bank now warns us that a new wave of mass repossessions is coming. The fact that the EU institutions are legislating on how to deal with non—performing loans (NPLs) could and should be an opportunity to put in place strong protection for borrowers. But we can already see from the Commission and the Council’s approach, that their only interest is to actually restore the massive profits of Europe’s banks. The Commission’s proposal on the secondary market for NPLs will have extreme and, in my view, appalling consequences on mortgage holders. If the ECB won’t protect ordinary people from debt vultures, if the national central banks won’t, if the Commission and Council won’t, then people will rightly ask who will.

Many of these critiques that we heard just a few minutes ago simply give a picture of some ignorance on the part of our colleagues, who unfortunately don’t understand how monetary policy works. That was on the past. Now to the future. We, and especially the ECB, face three important challenges. We have to recall that a slowdown is under way in the European economy and that the next recession is probably around the corner. Is the ECB prepared to face this challenge? What is important is to build room for manoeuvre in monetary policy, because at the zero/lower band interest rate level there is not so much flexibility on the monetary policy side to help the economy.

Let us look, for example, at the sovereign debt crisis: we would never have had a sovereign debt crisis if we had not had the euro. For as long as states have their national currency, they can always service their national debt by printing their own money. We would never have had a banking crisis of this magnitude if we had not had the euro, because the banking crisis came about only because the states were sitting on huge holdings of government bonds, and these government bonds were at risk because the states could no longer print their own money. We would not have had a banking crisis, we would not have had a sovereign debt crisis, and we would not have had mass unemployment – and there would have been enormous youth unemployment almost everywhere in southern Europe. After all, all these difficulties have been broken by the euro. We have nothing to celebrate at the euro. We must work hard to somehow get to grips with all the problems that the euro has piled up.

Italy has had a primary surplus for twenty-five years, so the story that italians have lived beyond their means is a colossal bale, probably invented by German or French bankers. If we have a deficit every year, it is only because of the interest on a public debt that has grown disproportionately, especially in the 1980s thanks to interest rates of up to 10 %, which is a real bottleneck. In this absurd way, we have reached 2 300 billion in public debt, on which the Italians have so far paid 3 500 billion in interest debt, so once and a half the debt itself. A real scandal. Now European banks buy this public debt, german banks, French banks also buy it and they also buy it with money lent by the ECB at very low interest rates, at very low interest rates and without any conditionality, which has allowed these banks to speculate precisely on those countries with high spreads. But unfortunately they also buy it with money created out of nowhere, simply by adding zeros to the computer.  The problem, however, is that italian citizens pay for them with the real economy, they pay for them with real sweat, not with a sweat invented out of nothing. However, this system seems to please everyone, the banks are happy because they are in fact speculating quietly, bringing their capital back, the states that place their government bonds are satisfied, unfortunately it is the real economy that pays.  It is those small and medium-sized enterprises that pay for the real economy, those companies that no longer have access to credit, and where there is no access to credit, unemployment is rising. Unemployment in the European Union has reached appalling levels precisely in those countries where public debt has grown; I am talking about Greece and Spain and, unfortunately, Italy as well.  Now, if we read Article 127 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, it is said that, in addition to price stability – you said that this has essentially been achieved – the ECB must contribute to achieving the Union's objectives, namely to combat unemployment and promote balanced economic growth.  So my question is: does the ECB really intend to combat financial speculation? Does the ECB really intend to act in a targeted and differentiated way to eliminate the spreads of individual Member States? Does the ECB really intend to wipe out the spread mechanism that destroys the economy of Member States such as Italy and invariably destroys or irreparably weakens the European Union itself?", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 216, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Marcus PRETZELL", "mepid": "124830", "text": "   Mr President, Mr Draghi, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for the work she has done.

Why was it the European Central Bank that had to remove the chestnuts from the fire? Before a single currency is created, political and economic integration is normally the first to be implemented. The euro has taken the exact opposite path. We threw the newborn euro in the pool and he will learn to swim by himself, but that has not happened, or not quite, and that makes our currency union very vulnerable even today, because the economic differences between Member States are still very large. Such differences are difficult to maintain unless sufficient solidarity mechanisms are built in, but that is not the case for the time being.  So why did the ECB have to save the euro? Because there has been a lack of political courage to finish our currency union. Today, the economic outlook is a little gloomier again. We are faced with the choice: either we complete monetary union so that it is able to withstand the next crisis, or let the ECB do the work again. For me, the choice is very clear: allow me to invite colleagues who have not spared the ECB's rod this afternoon and who have gone beyond its books, to join the cart and to create a currency union with sufficient solidarity mechanisms, including in the area of fiscal policy and a deep banking and capital markets union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 219, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Pirkko RUOHONEN-LERNER", "mepid": "132366", "text": "   – Mr President, the report on the Annual Report of the European Central Bank states how the EU economy grew in 2017 at the fastest rate in 10 years and unemployment was at its lowest level since 2008.

So, therefore, we count on your continued support for the Capital Markets Union project, which would lead to deeper and better-connected capital markets and thus also foster the international standing of the euro.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 225, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Mario Draghi", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Central Bank. – Mr President, first of all, I thank the rapporteur, honourable Member, Mr Mato, for his report. I certainly thank you for all the compliments the ECB has received and I will respond to the criticisms. First of all, about the European Deposit Insurance Scheme (EDIS). The ECB has always been a supporter of EDIS, of the insurance. I want just to make three points about that. First of all, whatever the road is to EDIS, the final goal of having a fully mutualised EDIS should always remain in sight. Now the road to that goal is not going to be simple, we all know that. And so various steps and delays and compromises and negotiations are necessary. But the direction and the sense of final results should always be present. So what you decide about how to move ahead, will be really in your own judgment. The important thing is that, whatever you decide, we’ll never compromise over the final outcome. The third point I want to make about EDIS is that there is no clear progress on this road unless there is convincing risk reduction everywhere. By the way, big progress has been achieved on that front already but more needs to be done. The ECB has shown in various places on various occasions that risk sharing also itself contributes to risk reduction, so the two arms of this journey towards the final goal of a fully—neutralised insurance system should go hand in hand.  Several questions addressed the economic effects of the policy of the ECB. Comparisons were made with non—euro parts of the world and with before the euro – how the world was beautiful, fantastic, before the euro. I’ve gone through these comparisons in a recent speech I gave. It was not fantastic, especially for the countries that complain most today about the euro; it was not fantastic at all before the euro. Let me make a comparison with the United States, because someone raised that point. The employment rate in 1998 in the euro area at 19 was 59.8%, now it’s 67.3% – the highest ever in the euro area. In the United States, it was 73.9% in 1998, today it’s 70.6% so it went down, not up.  The jobs created in the euro area over this period of time have been 19.8 million. And the jobs created in the United States were 17.2 million. Of course we have to be careful about making these comparisons because the units have to be standardised and the same thing we get on the employment numbers, in millions. So when I’m asked about the side effects of our monetary policy in the euro area, the response is that the main side effect between 2013 – when the situation was at its worst – and today, has been the creation of 9.6 million jobs, which is more than ever. That’s the main side effect.  Other questions related to the presence of financial stability risks. Well, it’s true that in certain localised areas over the euro area we observed that valuations are stretched in prime commercial real estate. Also in some areas of some countries in the residential real estate, in some segments of the bond market. But are any of these risks prone to generate systemic financial stability risk? The answer that we give so far is no. But of course we monitor all this very carefully. And the answer to these local situations cannot be a change in monetary policy. It has to be the use of macroprudential tools by the national governments. We’ve said this and, in fact, national governments have indeed responded, with their national instruments together with the ECB. More generally, some questions addressed the role of the ECB and very rightly, as observed by the rapporteur, the ECB has its role but cannot fill all the roles that everybody else should fill. The ECB has a role which is limited to monetary policy, which is circumscribed by its mandate. It cannot do everybody else’s job. In this sense, as I have said on a variety of occasions including this morning, not all its benefits have accrued to all the members of the euro area. Why is that? Because of two main reasons. Reforms are necessary in these countries whether they belong to the euro, or are outside the euro. You have got to make the reforms that are necessary. There is not a blueprint which is the same for all countries. It does change from country to country; each country has its own history. And so that’s the basic thing: no reforms, no growth. But then there are also problems, also incompleteness in the Economic and Monetary Union. And the first incompleteness is to finish the things that had been decided already, namely the banking union. The second is to start to move fast on the capital markets union and the third is to build fiscal capacity. But if you do the first two things – and the European Parliament has really carried out a very positive and constructive role at each and every point in time of this discussion – if these two things are done, we are way better, even if the next steps on the creation of the fiscal capacity may take longer for pretty obvious political difficulties. There was one question about what the ECB could do about certain specific loans that banks have lent to citizens. Generally, the ECB cannot do anything about that, it’s the national competent authority. Very often, these issues are a consumer protection issue, so it’s the national consumer protection authority that has to monitor the conditions of lending. But generally speaking – and this holds true also in other countries where the non—performing loans (NPLs) problem is really very dramatic because of its social consequences – in non—performing loans you always have two types of debtors: the ones who are normal or even strategic debtors and the ones who are part of a big social problem. For these problems, the response is not to change the payments culture but rather to help the poor people who cannot pay back. One should keep the two things separate. Don’t change, don’t affect, don’t damage, don’t harm your banking system, your financial system because the result of this will only be that they will not be able to lend as much as they could to the private sector of your economy, but rather help the poor people who cannot pay.  Now, one question that has been asked from several sides is if we are heading towards the next recession – and I will say something about that in a moment – does the ECB have the tools to address this? The answer is yes. The ECB has the tools to address this but keep in mind that our present monetary policy stance is very accommodative already. We have negative interest rates and they are expected to be like this for an extended period of time. And, even though we have decided to stop the net asset purchases, we also decided that the current stock will stay what it is for a considerable period of time. What does it mean? It means that, as bonds come to maturity, we repurchase the bonds. What does it mean in terms of numbers? It means that we will continue buying, by and large – at least this year or the next year – 15 billion euros of bonds a month, which was, by and large, what we had been buying in the last 3 months of last year.  There was perhaps more than one question about whether our monetary policy has helped equity. We went into some depth in trying to understand what the effects are of monetary policy on the distribution of income, distribution of wealth. It’s quite clear that each monetary policy decision has distributional effects. When we change interest rates we change distribution between creditors and debtors, or between young and old. But certainly the asset purchases, the quantitative easing (QE), have distributional impacts which are even more visible and direct because asset prices go up and the owners of assets are usually the wealthy ones.  So the question we ask ourselves is, is our policy worsening the distribution? If you consider all the effects, the answer is no. Why is that? It is true that it worsens the distribution in the short term. However, what is the factor that worsens the distribution more than any other factor? It’s the unemployment. Where the monetary policy of the ECB has been a success was in fostering strong employment growth, as I presented at the beginning of this response.  One question addressed the point of access by SMEs to credit. Has our policy prevented, restrained, or shrunk access by SMEs to credit? The answer is absolutely no. Both our corporate bond programme and our QE programme created space in the bank’s balance sheet for lending more to the SMEs. All data since 2013, since even when we started with the longer—term refinancing operations (LTROs) – by the way the LTROs are not unconditional lending – and the targeted longer—term refinancing operations (TLTROs), is lending to banks on condition they lend to firms, to the real economy. I don’t know where the fairy tale thing about EUR 29 out of a hundred actually came from.  In terms of another interesting irony of some of the questions, was that one hears that monetary financing of the deficit is now the solution to all problems. That’s one of the questions that was raised before. That is actually interesting. First of all, because when monetary financing was available, for the countries that actually vastly used monetary financing before the euro, the situation was very bad. They got very high inflation and they got unemployment higher than countries that did not use monetary financing. What is actually quite paradoxical is that you hear this solution of monetary financing from people who were against monetary financing as an utmost crime until yesterday.  I think I have responded to most of the problems, and now one word about the outlook. If we take a snapshot of the situation as it is today, statically, we still see a situation where consumption is still expanding, relatively strong, investment still expanding, supported by our monetary policy, export growth is less, but still good. And the labour market keeps on being very strong.  However, all this is happening at lower and lower growth rates. And we have been receiving weaker data than expected now for a longer time than we had expected a few months ago. In other words, at the beginning we had lower data and we said – and we continue to say, by the way – that some of this weaker momentum was due to temporary factors, and specific to sectors and certain countries. For example, what happened to the car industry; this is one example which is a temporary drop. But then we also said that there are also some more permanent causes of this slowing—down. And the causes of this slowing—down are going to stay. One of which is simply that 2017 was a pretty exceptional year when compared with historical averages. And so we return to a lower growth path.  But then the question that we should ask is, first of all, is this what is called a sag or is it heading towards a recession? And the answer we give is no, it’s a slowdown, which is not heading towards a recession, but it could be longer than was expected before. And on what does the length of this slowdown depend? To answer this question we have to go back and ask ourselves what are the factors that originally caused this weakening in growth. And the factors deal primarily with some slowdown in China, of course, but with what we call geopolitical uncertainties. And here, the natural question to ask is how long will these geopolitical uncertainties last. These geopolitical uncertainties put into question the pillars upon which the order, that was built after the Second World War, was constructed. And they put into question the European Union. They have to do with Brexit. They have to do with trade tensions with China. They have to do with the denial of the multilateral system. And we notice, however, that some of these things get better and some others get worse.  The result of this, however, is that, at least for some time to come, there’s going to be a continuing uncertainty that changes nature, and this has a cost. And the cost is lower confidence – lower business confidence and lower consumer confidence. That’s why we are now assessing the situation, as I said. My impression is, Mr President, that I have responded to all questions.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Commissioner, I would like to thank the Rapporteur for his I am sorry that Mr Draghi is leaving us precisely in this discussion because it really concerns him as well. I am a little concerned when I listen to the previous discussion for the reason that it appeared that some of my colleagues would not really remember what history really looked like in the decades after the Second World War. If you look at the economic development from 1945 onwards, you could say that it perhaps consisted mainly of a lot of devaluations. So financial mistakes were repaired by going down that road. This was the case for Finland. That was also the case for others. You may remember that Britain was still in great difficulty around 1956, and from 1956 onwards we see that the problems of monetary, monetary policy are only increasing and increasing. At some stage, a young Social Democratic politician took to the stage. It was Willy Brandt. He had just been elected Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany, and when I read what he wrote at the time, I have a faint feeling that he was quite led by the council and the inability to solve the economic problems that could be seen in Europe. He therefore proposed that the European states, the EU Member States, should solve the problems by creating a European Monetary Fund, and he offered twenty per cent of their currency surplus espart for Germany to create, as it were, a nest egg for future solutions. There were, of course, conditions in this nest egg. One condition was that we should learn to stick to the rules, and this is where the difficulties arose. I find a rather interesting quote in Willy Brandt's memoir \"Begegnungen und Einsichten\": Our iron-fisted rules on the parallelity of our currency economic decisions have always come true. He says this in German if you want to hear the original: \"Unsere Eisenregeln der Parallelität von Währungs- und Wirtschaftspolitische Massnahmen war immerhin bestworden\". This is what happened after Mr Brandt's initiative for ten or twenty years of increasing and increasing problems in the European banking world, in European monetary policy, and at some stage the politicians are minding and creating what we have today celebrated the 20th anniversary of. Today, then, we have a much more robust system than we have ever had before. Is that system waterproof? Does it hold for all the trials? We know that's not true. During the crisis of 2007 and 2008, we saw that the system did not quite hold up to all the trials of European banking policy at that time. After that, however, we have actually created reasonably functioning rules. Anyone who follows economic policy in recent years can see that Banco Popular – a Spanish bank that failed to meet its obligations – was simply dissolved by our current rules. And we have another example that also speaks volumes: Banca Carige from Genoa has, of course, been brought under the administration of the European Central Bank. So we have many problems, we have loans that are not repaid, we have a lot of other problems, but at least today we are in a far better position than we were ten or fifteen, not to mention 50 years ago.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 230, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mr Torvalds for his annual report on the banking union. The report provides us with an excellent account of how the banking union has helped foster a single market and contributed to creating a level playing field and financial stability. Much has been achieved since its inception in terms of the overhaul of the regulatory and supervisory framework for financial institutions. But the work is not complete yet. Completion of the banking union is one of the Commission’s priorities, and we very much welcome the fact that the report also underlines a continued commitment towards this goal. Since last year’s debate, I am pleased to say that we have made some tangible progress. Firstly, we have an agreement on the so—called banking package. Gunnar Hökmark and Peter Simon negotiated this on behalf of the Parliament. The banking package will strengthen the prudential framework and increase banks’ ability to absorb losses in times of crisis without the need for taxpayers’ money. The technical work aimed at its finalisation is ongoing, and we look forward to early completion so that Parliament may still have the final word before the recess.  Secondly, significant progress has been made in the implementation of the action plan adopted by the Council in July 2017 to tackle non—performing loans (NPLs), including through the adoption by the Commission of a number of proposals and communications. Under Roberto Gualtieri and Esther de Lange’s rapporteurship, you have reached a very quick agreement with the Council on the prudential backstop to prevent the accumulation of non—performing loans in the future. Recent data has shown that in 2018, bank capital and liquidity positions continued to improve, and bank leverage decreased while loss absorption capacity improved. At the same time, NPLs on bank balance sheets have continued to decline and MREL buffers are being built up. The Commission is encouraged to see that NPL ratios have fallen in nearly all Member States, facilitated by determined actions by banks and policymakers. But at the same time, the different levels of NPLs among Member States must be further addressed and the NPL Action Plan should be fully implemented.  Thirdly, a number of money laundering scandals involving European banks surfaced in 2018, and the Commission came forward with a legislative proposal, as well as an accompanying communication, on strengthening the Union’s framework for prudential and anti-money laundering supervision. Our proposals are part of the wider package of measures that will strengthen the three European supervisory authorities and their anti—money laundering tools. I welcome the position which Parliament has just adopted on the basis of report by Pervenche Berès and Othmar Karas. I count on your full support to conclude negotiations on the legislative proposal before the end of this legislature.  Bank exposure to sovereigns is another area where the Commission shares Parliament’s view that this is a problem with significant implications. In 2018, the Commission also presented a proposal for a regulatory framework for sovereign bond—backed securities, with the aim of further reducing the link between banks and their respective sovereigns.  Regarding think tanks, the Commission fully agrees with the need to ensure a level playing field between market participants, while supporting the uptake of innovative technologies in the financial sector. This has been reflected in our communication on Fintech, which took the form of an action plan and covered a number of initiatives to strengthen, among other things, cyber resilience.  But, as I mentioned, despite all the steps forward, we are not yet there. More needs to be done on the common backstop for a single resolution fund and a European deposit insurance scheme (EDIS). I very much welcome that the report recognises the importance of continued work on these proposals. As regards the common backstop, we are making progress. The agreement, reached in December 2013 at the Euro Summit, must now be swiftly implemented into ESM treaty change, hopefully by the middle of this year. Going forward, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), as a backstop provider, should be integrated into the Union framework. This will enhance the democratic scrutiny of its activities.  We are unfortunately less advanced on the establishment of EDIS, which is the essential third pillar of the banking union, so I urge you to finalise the report under Esther de Lange’s rapporteurship before the elections to show Parliament’s support for this project. I also urge you to look at the banking union as an initiative that benefits all Europeans. We have achieved a lot since the crisis broke out, with a real positive impact on businesses and households. At the same time, we will be held accountable for the risks entailed by an unfinished banking union. So let us use the remaining time in this political cycle effectively and make tangible progress towards completing the banking union.

Today when we are celebrating 20 years of the euro it is important to see how much things have changed recently. Financial markets are about analysing risks, taking risks and distributing risks, and by the different steps and cornerstones of the banking union, we have today a better opportunity to analyse risks. That is one of the advantages of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), but also the establishment of supervisory authorities. We have provided a more secure framework in which to take risks; but there will always be crises. The question is how are we to deal with them, and how capable are we of getting out of them? The establishment of both a backstop and better legislation, hopefully, coming out on the non-performing loans will be a part of that, and the BRRD as such also clarifies that all those who invest in a bank are taking a risk.

For us, it is important: firstly, proportionality between small and large banks. In America, there is regulation for Wall Street – the big ones – and for Mainstreet – for the small. We have not yet achieved this in Europe. Secondly, the fight against money laundering will only be successful if it is implemented by the Member States. Thirdly, problem loans must be further reduced. We are in agreement on this. Fourthly, the diversity of EU banking models must not be called into question.

I would like to draw your attention to two messages. The first message is that we need to go further. As you mentioned, the issue of the fight against money laundering obliges in particular to strengthen the European Banking Authority - that is the choice you have made and this Parliament has supported you - so that it becomes a real pool with the other supervisory authorities, to make the fight against money laundering a decisive factor. This will only be possible with a review of the governance of the supervisory authorities, and we hope that the Commission will fully support us in the mandate given to us by a large majority of our competent committee.  The second message I would like to make here relates to this famous debate between risk reduction and risk-sharing, because we have the impression that sometimes some Member States, some Members of this Parliament, have the capacity to exercise the gradual slippage of requirements in a way that is completely unacceptable. The European deposit insurance system has been part of the banking union since day one. We therefore have a requirement: what has been done for risk reduction, under the pressure of time and at the request of a number of Member States, must be accompanied, in a way, by what is due, namely this commitment to the European deposit insurance system.

Firstly, we have the risks in the banks that are already there, which can also be retouched by bank balance sheet tricks, as we all know. Second, Mr Draghi is again producing bad loans by forcing banks to take risks they would not normally take. And thirdly, we have the moral hazard problem.

There is a solution, which we have proposed: the creation of a borrowers' rescue fund, so that Greeks do not lose their homes.

It will simplify and make it possible to fill market failures. This InvestEU has four windows, in the area of infrastructure, research and innovation, of small and medium-sized enterprises and also in the social area. It is a continuation to which other financial instruments of the Juncker plan of the European Fund for Strategic Investments are added. Some had doubts, but today it is proven that it is a programme that has helped some 1.2 million jobs exist in the European Union and has supported more than 800,000 small and medium-sized enterprises.  A programme that helps economic growth, a programme that helps small and medium-sized enterprises that is underway. With InvestEU, our ambition cannot diminish and we should have the same amount of the guarantee that we have at the moment at least for the three financial instruments, and so we propose to strengthen the guarantee to stick to this objective which is maintenance. We have a small difference from the Commission and I would like to welcome the Vice-President and all the work that has been done in this area. The Commission proposes EUR 650 billion, we propose EUR 700 billion. In addition, we believe that, of course, the Union's policies must be absolutely guaranteed and the objectives in the area of climate, in the area also of what is the strategy we want for sustainability, but also for growth and inclusion. The European Investment Bank, we give legal certainty so that at least 75% of the guarantee and then all other national promotion banks and other financial institutions should have access to the other 25%. It is extremely important that this programme also contributes to social cohesion, territorial cohesion, economic cohesion of the European Union, and therefore the geographical balance is extremely important and has here a point that is the Advisory Hub - the platform for investment advice - which should be strengthened and which should allow projects in the regions to , projects from the most remote cities in the European Union can have access to this programme and hence the concern with the smaller projects. The need to continue to be able to have investment platforms is essential. May this Advisory Hub have a more active presence, a more proactive stance. In our proposal we have also simplified governance. Furthermore, with regard to additionality, we want it to remain, of course, adapted to what is the new reality and the three financial instruments and that there cannot be an additional definition that prevents, for example, social investment. I would like to end and thank all my fellow rapporteurs and, in particular, the rapporteur who is the rapporteur of the Socialist party, rapporteur Gualtieri, for the work we have done together.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to thank Mr Fernandes and all the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation. The 2008 crisis led to an unprecedented fall in investment, both public and private, across the European Union. Investment conditions in Europe have improved in recent years thanks to a more favourable economic situation, flexibility in the interpretation of the Stability Pact, new initiatives such as that of the European Fund for Strategic Investments, but the volume of investment in Europe still remains below the average level reached in the decade before the crisis, and new and more important gaps have also opened up in innovation-related sectors. , physical and social infrastructure, climate change. This situation is worrying for the future of Europe's competitiveness and social cohesion, for its long-term growth and for the creation of new jobs. That is why it is good that the Commission, by proposing the establishment of the InvestEU programme, has sought not only to renew but also to step up investment support.  However, InvestEU is not only a tool that continues the positive experience of EFSI and other projects developed in recent years. In addition to further strengthening support for small and medium-sized enterprises, research, innovation and sustainable infrastructure, this programme aims to begin to address the huge social infrastructure gap, denounced by the task force's report on investments in social infrastructure last January, ensuring the feasibility of projects in the field of education, health and social housing.  The primary objective of investEU is to close the investment gap in the sectors and geographical areas where it is most needed, and to do so Parliament has intervened with a series of improvements to the Commission's text.  Firstly, we have established that the cost of the guarantee for investment promoters should be exclusively linked to the characteristics and risk profile of the underlying transactions, and that more favourable conditions can be applied to promote the construction of investment platforms, to encourage investment in areas where the investment gap is greatest, or to encourage intervention in those sectors where the need for investment is most pronounced. Secondly, in addition to reiterating that the EIB will continue to be the Commission's main financial partner under InvestEU, we have enhanced the important role of national promotion banks in financing investment projects. National promotion banks will have direct access to the European guarantee, which will allow greater flexibility and therefore greater possibilities for financing projects, with positive consequences for the level of investment and the creation of new jobs. Finally, we have established that the Member States will not only have the opportunity to channel part of their resources allocated under the cohesion policy funds, but will also be able to contribute with additional resources which will, in principle, be considered as one-off contributions to the calculation of the structural deficit for the purposes of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The text we are about to vote on is, on the whole, balanced, including the part requiring that at least 65 % of investments under the sustainable infrastructure window contribute to achieving the objectives set out in the Paris Climate and Environment Agreements. I would therefore ask you to keep the text voted on by the ECON Committee with regard to this 65 % ceiling. With this text, I believe, we are giving a concrete response to those who are calling for Europe to do more for investment, growth and jobs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 252, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy. – Mr President, InvestEU is one of the flagship programmes of the new EU budget 2021-2027 and will mobilise over EUR 650 billion of additional investment in the EU.

It is also a pleasure to see so many colleagues here who have wanted to implement EFSI in their own constituencies by presenting what EFSI can do, what advisory services can do and raise awareness, and this is the reason why EFSI has already been a success story. It is a good opportunity to continue this success story and that is why we have initiated the InvestEU proposal.  I want to thank this House for its continued backing throughout this mandate to the Commission's initiatives in support of investment.  When this Commission took office in late 2014, investment had fallen by 15% in the EU as a result of the financial and economic crisis.  We had to take comprehensive action to tackle this investment gap and to reinstate confidence both in the Union economy and also in the capacity of EU institutions to deliver for citizens. The investment plan for Europe was the Commission's answer to the situation and you were vigilant allies in setting up the European Fund for Strategic Investments to this end.  Today, the investment conditions in Europe have improved. However, there is still a sizeable investment gap in Europe, especially when it comes to social infrastructure and investments in the environmental and digital transition.  In the context of this proposal, for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, the Commission has therefore put forward a single multi-policy investment support instrument – the InvestEU fund.  The InvestEU fund will combine 13 centrally managed financial instruments and the EFSI into a single EUR 38 billion budgetary currency.  It will have a strong policy focus and, while the EIB will remain the Commission’s main strategic partner in this implementation, it will also be open to other partners such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Council of Europe Development Bank or national promotional banks and institutions. The Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s report on InvestEU. The report touches on many important items but broadly endorses the Commission's proposal.  Regarding the proposed changes, the Commission is open to considering those related to covenants, in particular those that increase the independence of the Investment Committee and safeguard the Commission's policy steer.  As regards the concerns expressed regarding the role of the EIB under InvestEU compared with EFSI, let me inform you that the Commission and the EIB have jointly proposed a partnership that would enshrine the EIB group’s 75% share of the EU currently in the regulation. The partnership would also put the EIB’s banking expertise to the best use for the design of a rationalisation of financial risk monitoring and reporting of the InvestEU programme. This partnership proposal is, of course, subject to the co-legislators’ consideration.  Some of your amendments are linked to the broader MFF discussion, such as the overall amount of currency and the climate targets. For the time being, we will take note of them and see them as a testimony of the Parliament's commitment to a strong Union with a strong budget and to the Union’s COP 21 goals.  On behalf of the Commission, let me express our appreciation for the tremendous effort the rapporteurs, the shadows and also associated committees have done to reach a position within a very ambitious timeline with a view to an agreement before the European elections. I very much hope that these tireless efforts will also be reflected in tomorrow's world.

It is true that we were on a good basis with the proposal put forward by the Commission, but I believe that in the parliamentary process, thanks to the rapporteurs and negotiators of other political groups, we have improved that proposal. From the beginning of the economic crisis for the Socialists, it was a priority to establish an investment plan that would allow economies to be relaunched, but relaunched on the right path; and this is for sustainable growth. In this mandate we have already worked on the first strategic investment plan, which we know as the Juncker Plan, and on its expansion. And, as always, everything is improveable, but the results I think can be described as satisfactory. This new investment plan is based not only on these good results and on the experience of the previous plan, but also brings together under one umbrella financial instruments that were dispersed by different programmes. We also had been demanding time, and what it's going to do is have a much more flexible, more efficient and simpler instrument, and therefore with a better impact. The aim of this programme, it has already been said, is to mobilize almost EUR 700 billion, thanks to the European budget, and to allocate them to investments that will enable the European Union to grow in a smart way, that is by investing in knowledge, in sustainable infrastructure or by facilitating access to finance for small and medium-sized enterprises. This new plan will also enable us to social infrastructure and give a fundamental impetus in the fight against climate change. I also think it is important to highlight the role given to promotional banks that exist at the national or regional level, because it will create very positive synergies and bring investment closer to the specific needs of the territories.

Above all, we must finally ensure that the EU does not rise above the private sector. We need private investment. But when we see that we have a zero interest rate policy, we have a flood of money, there is enough money – why not invest? In other words, we have very different problems here than providing the private sector with money. What we will achieve with InvestEU is the same as with the EFSI, with the Juncker Plan.

Secondly, a profit that motivates a business that is investing taxpayers’ money into it is a subsidy that distorts the market on which taxpayers must themselves rely, whether it is consumers, investors or both. State aid rules were intended to ensure a level playing field in the use of subsidies. That’s why the EU wants to impose the EU state aid rules on the UK during, and even after, transition. But it won’t be a level playing field because this legislation will streamline the approval process for EU businesses, but not UK ones.

We see that Europe needs investment. Mr Katainen has put this in a good place. The share of production in GDP is still declining in Europe. We have set ourselves the target of 20%, but we are now around 15% and France and the United Kingdom are already scratching at the 10% mark. So, here we can see that the European Union really needs to act.  My personal objective would be to increase the share of production in Europe back to 30% by 2030, so we too need to get production from the rest of the world, which has been relocated to other countries in recent years, back with Industry 4.0 and with the Skills package, the training package that has been created here. I believe that the SME window benefits us very much, including in risk-sharing. Small and medium-sized enterprises in particular need to take on risks.

Firstly, there is a clear need to further mobilise public and private investments in the European Union, but this investment should follow a rationale, serve a clear purpose and aim at achieving common goals. In other words, the InvestEU programme must be a useful tool to transform our economies into carbon-neutral inclusive economies. They must foster energy transition and take into account social and environmental concerns. We definitely have to be determined to accomplish the Paris Agreement and the SDGs. That is why we strive for bigger climate spending targets when it comes to supporting strategic investments and exclude projects that could be environmentally harmful. Secondly, we strongly oppose the funding of defence projects with InvestEU. The militarisation of the EU budget, be it through investments or through research support, is not the proper way to solve the security challenges that we are facing. InvestEU funds should be invested in many other areas with a much more evident need of investment, not least in the social economy.

I will answer some of the concerns or questions and comment on some of the ideas raised by honourable Members.  First, I have to say that the InvestEU fund is more of a policy driven fund than the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) has been. This doesn’t mean that projects are selected politically – not at all. They are selected according to the quality of the project and whether EFSI can really create some added value. The idea is to address policies like climate change or improve digitalisation or increase financing for small and medium-sized companies, which are lacking finance in certain Member States. This is what I mean when saying that it’s a more policy driven fund.  Second, the basic idea of EFSI will be maintained, meaning that InvestEU is also a demand driven fund. Nobody is forced to use EFSI if they are not willing to, but on the other hand you can get EFSI financing if you apply. The third element is that EFSI’s idea is to crowd in private liquidity, private money for investments – from the bank account for investments – which creates jobs and competitiveness and addresses our policy targets. By pooling together 13 existing financial instruments, it should be clear to everybody that, from the end user’s point of view, InvestEU is much easier to use. So you don’t need to know all the 13 different funds and think about what might be suitable for your use. You only have to know that there is an InvestEU fund which can provide guarantees of different kinds of financing for your projects. In addition to this combination or pooling together of 13 funds, we will pool together 13 different advisory services. Again, from an end user’s point of view, applying technical assistance becomes much easier. The novelty in the InvestEU fund – or one of them – is that we will allocate 25% of current fees, according to demand, from financial institutions other than the EIB. The EIB is a valuable partner for the Commission – also in the future – but we want to improve and encourage new financial innovations. The EIB is not always willing or capable or it doesn’t want to invest in all the different projects which someone else could do – national promotional banks or the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) or the Council of Europe Bank. I believe that this 25% allocation to banks other than the EIB will create clear added value.  I also want to remind all honourable Members, if you are interested, to look at what EFSI has achieved. Just visit EFSI’s website. You can easily find it if you google EFSI or go to the EIB’s website. Every single project which has been signed is mentioned and you can just click on your own country and there’s a list of the projects which are already signed in your country.  EFSI has not been the medicine for all diseases and neither is the InvestEU fund the medicine which addresses all the probable problems in the world, but it’s a valuable additional investment tool which can create concrete jobs and modernise our economy, making it more sustainable, and create added value to our welfare societies.  A final point, on EFSI: one thing which makes me especially happy when looking at what EFSI has achieved is to look at the countries which have mostly benefited from EFSI. Looking at EFSI investment per country’s GDP, the number one user is Greece, second Estonia, third Portugal, fourth Spain, and fifth Lithuania. Latvia is sixth, Bulgaria seventh, Finland eighth, Poland ninth, and Italy tenth. So mostly the financing has gone in the right direction, exactly to the countries and regions of those countries which have had some financial constraints. When looking at the quality of the projects, it’s also impressive. It has improved since we started EFSI and I am sure that InvestEU will do the same in the future.

I am not yet impressed by the voices that are against private initiative, fortunately few, but have still been heard in this Plenary.  It is businesses and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises that create jobs. I would also remind you that this fund can and should be used by regional, local public authorities, and is therefore an added value and an additional instrument that is very important for investment and particularly in places where there are market failures. That is why, in my view, it is incomprehensible that those who claim employment are then against instruments that help job creation. Furthermore, this instrument also helps inclusion, has a window that we reinforced, which is a window for the social area and also the investment window for small and medium-sized enterprises. I also think it is very important that there should be no confusion about the compartment that is for the Member States. In addition to the EUR 700 billion that we propose, in terms of investment, with the guarantee of around EUR 40 billion, we have the possibility that Member States can use this InvestEU by placing a guarantee from the Structural Funds. But this is no transfer, these Structural Funds and this percentage belong to those same Member States, Member States which can allocate and mobilise with a triple A, also use the possibility of avoiding the difficulties resulting from State aid and can move forward with additional investments for well-defined projects.  It is important now that Member States also make the definition of the projects they consider important as regards the use of this compartment.

Building on the leverage principle of Juncker’s Plan, InvestEU aims to trigger almost EUR 700 billion of private and public additional investment by providing an EU budget guarantee of EUR 40 billion. The purpose is to supply financing to economic actors with a risk profile that private financiers are not always able or willing to address. This is definitely the case of SMEs, which are currently facing considerable challenges when accessing finance across within the EU. Accordingly, I express my support for the increase of EUR 2.8 billion for SMEs and Social Investment windows, as I find it crucial for InvestEU to succeed in simplifying access to finance in all phases of SMEs’ lifecycles, but also in providing them with more diversified sources of funding.

This Agreement outweighs strictly commercial aspects, as it implies a relationship based on international standards, common values and standards that has had a very positive impact on the socio-economic development of the parties. It is also a tool that allows us to consolidate our strategic partnership with Latin America, which is of vital importance to the European Union.  The Trade Agreement has contributed to economic stability, modernization and diversification of exports in Colombia and Peru. It is important for these countries to have a reference market outside Latin America that allows them to diversify their exports. The Agreement has helped Colombia and Peru modernize and diversify their exports and have been beneficial to their small and medium-sized enterprises.  For European companies too, the Agreement has led to an improvement in access to these markets, not only by eliminating tariffs, but also by reducing bilateral trade barriers. However, I believe that effective action must be taken by the Commission and the Member States so that our SMEs can exploit the full potential of trade agreements like this.  We must welcome the progress made in finding solutions to existing trade barriers, especially on sanitary and phytosanitary issues, but work remains to be done by Colombia and Peru to resolve issues such as the certification of certain meat and dairy products, the protection of union geographical indications or the taxation applied to the importation of spirits.  The Agreement has also enabled the development of cooperation mechanisms between the Commission and the Governments of Colombia and Peru, in mainly on trade and sustainable development issues. The objective has to be to work to ensure that international labour and environmental regulations are applied correctly.  Accompanied by a roadmap, the Agreement has also served to monitor social and environmental issues. We can say that positive progress has been made on the part of Colombia and Peru, but there is a long way to go and we must insist on compliance with the provisions reflected to ensure freedom of association, the right to collective bargaining, labour inspections, informal work, child labour or environmental issues.  I would like to congratulate the Government of Colombia on the bilateral and definitive ceasefire and hostilities agreement reached with the FARC guerrillas, and also on their entry into the OECD on 30 May, which recognises the important reforms undertaken in the country.  I also encourage Peru to make progress on its reforms under the OECD Country Programme. Finally, I would like to recall that this Agreement should also have been signed with all Andean countries, including Bolivia and Ecuador, which for political reasons did not want to negotiate it.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. This report on the implementation of the trade part of the Association Agreement with Central America was adopted by a large majority in the Committee on International Trade. In a globalized world, rules-based trade agreements are not only an important instrument of trade relations, but generally an element that can help bring stability to this rapidly changing world. There are positives to this report, but also worth thinking about. I would like to say first of all that this association agreement does indeed consist of three pillars, and unfortunately, to date – although the countries of Central America have all agreed to the agreement in 2013 – three Member States have not yet ratified the two pillars outside trade. We are seeing this time and again, and this undermines it, undermines the credibility of the European Union when it tries to launch trade agreements and association agreements with partners from other continents. From the point of view of this, first of all, the appeal itself to the three Member States concerned to get serious about ratification, so that the pillars can finally achieve a balance between trade policy, cooperation and political dialogue. I would like to make it clear once again that this agreement is the first – so to speak – from region to region agreement. We are, of course, dealing with countries in Central America, all of which also have specific challenges. You can see this in the figures, for example, if they are available to us: there are countries where trade has increased considerably in recent years, and there are countries where things are moving a little slower. At the same time, we see that there is also a certain vulnerability to change, if I take, for example, one of the countries where trade has increased particularly, namely Costa Rica, followed by Panama and Guatemala, where, on the other hand, changes in the south-east Asian region have dramatically lowered trade relations between this area and Costa Rica. We also need to look at these things in more detail. We also note – and this is also seen in other trade agreements – that both the partners and the European Union still have room for improvement when it comes to using the agreed tariffs and figures for trade. Certainly, the questions are also important from the point of view of Central America and 'What does the European Union export there?', which we have to see, which are still relatively one-sidedly oriented towards certain primary products?  It should also be pointed out in this context that, for example, certain areas of debate need to be discussed more intensively, namely the question of services. I believe, Commissioner, that there is also a need for action. And, of course, the appeal to the European Union and all Central American states to take into account the full implementation and ratification of environmental agreements at international level, including the Paris Agreement. There is still some catching up to do with the ILO agreements. There are some challenges that still need to be addressed, and we must not let up there. Finally, to name it, Austria, Belgium and Greece should finally ratify this association agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 292, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, allow me to start by wishing you all a Happy New Year and I am looking forward to close collaboration in the remaining months in this plenary, and between, of course.  I would also like to thank very much the European Parliament, the Committee on International Trade (INTA), and the two rapporteurs, Mr Böge and Mr Santiago Fisas Ayxelà, for the reports that you have just accounted for on the implementation of the Trade Pillar of the Association Agreement with Central America and the Trade Agreement between the EU and Peru and Colombia. Both of these reports deliver a very valuable contribution to assess the results of these agreements on the ground and the Commission is also launching this year a comprehensive evaluation study of both these agreements. As you rightly point out in these reports, implementation has gone well and they have had a positive impact on bilateral trade despite the negative impact of an unfavourable international economic context. At the same time, we need of course to pay close attention to the implementation of the trade and sustainable development provisions in certain Central American countries, particularly relating to labour provisions. There has been some progress, as you said; for example, with the recent establishment of the tripartite labour council in Guatemala. The Commission has also provided funding for events on corporate social responsibility, for strengthening the domestic advisory groups and directly to the ILO regional office. Colombia and Peru have also made some progress concerning effective implementation on sustainable development provisions. Contact with Peru has been particularly intense. I sent a letter to Peru’s Trade Minister last July stating our concerns about the insufficient implementation of commitments to protect fundamental labour rights, about Peru’s relaxation of environmental standards, to promote trade and investment, and about the non-sufficient consultation of civil society. Peru engaged very constructively in these discussions and we have achieved positive results.  The report on the Andean Agreement correctly highlights the importance of consultations with civil society. Here as well there has been progress. Last year Columbia established a dedicated domestic advisory group and Peru has committed to dedicated discussions on labour and environmental issues in some of the existing civil society consultation mechanisms that the government has chosen to rely upon. We need to continue to pay close attention in this area and we will engage with the countries covered by the Agreements in line with the 15-point action plan on trade and sustainable development presented last February.  Some issues are only partially covered in these Agreements, or not at all – gender, anti-corruption provisions or a complete chapter on investment. This is of course mainly due to the age of the Agreements – the negotiations were concluded in 2010 – so we need to see with our partners how we can move on with these challenges in the future.  Finally, let me underline that we fully share your view that in light of the challenging political situation in Central America and the Andean region, it is urgent – and also for our credibility as you so rightly said, Mr Böge – for both Agreements to enter fully into force. So we strongly support the call that Parliament has made for the Member States that have not yet ratified the Agreements to do so as soon as possible.

I sincerely believe that as important as signing good agreements is assessing their compliance and impact.  The implementation of the European Union Trade Agreements with Colombia, Peru and Central America has common ground that I would like to highlight.  First, their strategic value: both Agreements seal partnerships in defense of global economic governance, multilateralism, regional integration as fundamental pillars of sustainable development. The Agreement with Central America is the first bi-regional agreement signed by the European Union; and the one signed with Peru and Colombia, to which Ecuador fortunately acceded, remains open to the Andean Pact bloc.  From an economic point of view, all parties have seized new opportunities, and the diversification of their economies too dependent on their raw materials and agricultural production has been favored.  With regard to socialist claims in defence of the sustainable development objectives, I would like to stress that both agreements have sealed long-term commitments and created dialogue tables to ensure more respectful trade in human, social, labour and environmental rights.  In Peru, civil society is making use of formal channels of participation and has requested an investigation that would have been unthinkable in the absence of this Agreement.  Without further delay, I believe that in all countries independent advisory groups should be set up to ensure the participation of civil society in the follow-up to the Agreements. Because when we see human tides migrating from Central America seeking a better life and come up with a wall, or when we denounce the violation of human rights in Nicaragua, or when we strongly defend the peace agreement reached with Colombia, we need to be very aware of the tools provided by trade agreements and seek their full effectiveness.  That is why, from the S&amp;D Group, I call for the greatest efforts to fully implement these Agreements and to review them, to make them more effective and inclusive, including a chapter for SMEs; another to combat corruption, fraud and tax evasion; another on trade and gender; and also the possibility of implementing a sanctions-based mechanism, as a last resort if sustainable development clauses are breached. And—of what not!—the commitment to implement the Paris Agreement.  I sincerely believe that the European Union and Latin America share principles and values, and we have much to contribute for fairer and more inclusive trade.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has done. The advancement of a values- and rules-based free trade policy is undoubtedly one of the European Union's greatest success stories. It is increasingly becoming a core competence of the Union with a liberal signature. We recently concluded what is arguably the most modern trade agreement in the world with Japan. SMEs are supported, digitisation is affirmed, with strong chapters on public procurement and sustainability. This is how we enface a modern trade policy.  More than five years after the conclusion, the trade agreement with Colombia and Peru is now in an important phase of implementation. It sets out common values and international standards for human and labour rights, as well as sustainable development, which offers immense future opportunities, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises in the partner countries. The strategic value of the agreement is high for Europe, because In Latin America, too, China is aggressively entering the markets and thus binds sales and partner markets in the long term, except that the Chinese do not rely on a trade policy based on values and rules. In Colombia in particular, the agreement with the peace process, which unfortunately has recently stalled again, must once again be actively supported. A stable Colombia is the economic anchor of this region. But the much smaller market in Central America must not be overlooked from an EU point of view either. The Association Agreement does not always work well in terms of trade relations. Tariff quotas are not being fully utilised and European products and services still do not have satisfactory access to Central American markets. However, we are counting on constructive cooperation and also on improvements in the future.

The fact remains that the agreement has so far brought little economic support to the majority of the Colombian population, and domestic advisory groups should be given more space here.  If we, as the EU, remain inactive, there is a threat of an increase in violence, the erosion of human rights and the further destruction of the environment, not only in Colombia, the Andean region or Central America.

We should be ashamed that some of these organisations are named after European companies or their subsidiaries. It is unacceptable that only trade is operational from the three pillars of the agreement, and it is symptomatic of what are the priorities of this model of the European Union, neoliberal and extractivist. Trade is urgently needed that puts people and the planet at the centre, but for real and at once, through binding human rights and environmental clauses.

There is no agreement yet, but I will be happy to come back to the plenary to discuss this when there is one – very soon, I hope.  But what we are discussing are these two Agreements and it’s of course up to the Parliament how you want to organise the debates. With a regional agreement it can be difficult to discuss every country per se, but the Commission has just launched preparations to do full evaluations of both these Agreements and we will be looking into every country.  We can say that on trade these Agreements have delivered, a lot, but there is of course still much to do. As has been said by the two rapporteurs, we need to focus on implementation. There is work to do on SMEs, as you said. We have been focusing a lot to give special attention to the small and medium—sized companies in the countries we discuss through dedicated information on our website. We have the Market Access Database with the latest information on tariffs, rules of origin, statistics and different requirements and we are trying to put our companies together with the Latin American companies.  These Agreements are good in a way, but they are a little old. That is true. They were concluded in 2010, almost 10 years ago. Today, we would have asked to put other things and additional things in them and we will reflect with our partners on how to do that at a future stage. There are concerns about human rights in many of these countries. I fully agree that the situation in Nicaragua, for instance, is of great concern. We have raised it and, apart from these Agreements, there are different tools where we can address it and I know that the foreign affairs ministers will discuss Nicaragua in particular at their next meeting – I think next week – and possibly there will be a statement at that point as well. We are raising this in the Human Rights Dialogue on a regular basis and we are engaging with the countries, but we should also not deny that there has been some progress. I have been engaging particularly with Peru on the issue that Ms Hautala – who is no longer here – raised, on the labour issues, and they have started to engage with civil society, starting a dialogue on these issues, which is good. There are other examples as well. On the banana issues: as you know the conditions to suspend temporarily the preferences for bananas are defined in the Agreement. That is not an automatic decision. It depends on the impact of the imports on the stability of the EU market and each time that those thresholds have been exceeded for Central America, including last year, from the Commission side we have made an in-depth analysis and we have concluded that the excessive imports did not cause any destabilisation of the EU markets and had very little impact on the prices either. But we will continue to monitor this.  On the issue of frozen fries, as the Belgian gentleman mentioned, we are of course very much aware of this. We have raised it with the Colombian authorities several times and I do share concerns here. There also seems to be a problem of how they had been calculating it so we will be engaging with them in Bogota next week or at end of this month, with the trade team of the Colombian authorities to look at this in detail.

Latin America is a friendly region, to which we are joined by very strong historical ties. The trade agreements we have just discussed only strengthen this relationship and give a perspective on the strategic and geopolitical importance it has for the European Union. Dear and appreciated Helmut, I know there are many things to improve, but you have to see where they came from and where they are now. Suspending treaties would only make the situation worse, as Ramon Jáuregui has said very well. And it is true, dear Gabriel, dear Juan Fernando, that you have to be very vigilant on the banana issue. We have also been explained what measures the Commission is taking, as Commissioner Malmstrom has just told us. Since Peru and Colombia, and Ecuador as a recent incorporation, are strategic regions for the European Union, it is essential to continue to push the agreement forward so that it can reach its full potential. And we must remember that the agreement remains open to new additions, as it provides for an accession clause that leaves open the door to participation in it by other member countries of the Andean Community of Nations. And I would not like to end my speech without thanking all my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade, and in particular the shadow rapporteurs — a special mention of Inmaculada Rodríguez - Piñero who, with his contributions and help, has enabled a balanced and positive report which I hope will be adopted in the House tomorrow, with broad support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 315, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Reimer BÖGE", "mepid": "1037", "text": "  Rapporteur.

And I would like to say explicitly, Commissioner, that I believe that you and your team have done a really good job in the area of trade policy in recent years. I would like to express my agreement with my colleague, who said: yes, we must also look at where our partners come from and not only demand the absoluteness of 100% implementation, but also see how we develop, how progress progress is made, and that too must be properly taken into account. I come to another point. When I look at the fact that the very countries we have been talking about here, namely Peru and Colombia – Peru alone 500 000 and Colombia over one million – have taken in refugees from Venezuela, these countries are almost on the verge of collapse in their fragile situation. Are we doing enough together with the UNHCR, or are we still doing too little? We have a damn duty and guilt as the European Union to take care of this situation and to ensure that the departure into dictatorial regimes does not poison and destroy the entire neighbourhood of Latin and South America. Then all our efforts will be done overnight. And here, I believe, we have another task in the Commission – not only in trade policy – to insist very precisely that what we are asking for is actually implemented everywhere, and in view of the arrogance of the United States not to pretend, in the face of the cancellation of the Trans-Pacific Trade Agreement, that we simply casually leave this continent to the arrogance of large neighbours or even the insistence of other important partners such as China.

The Association Agreement between the European Union and Central America, the first genuine interregional association agreement ratified by the European Union, despite the complexities of the international economic framework, has undoubtedly produced positive developments in the field of trade policy. However, the failure to implement the pillars of political dialogue and cooperation has not led to significant progress in promoting democracy and the rule of law. Five years after its entry into force, the agreement should therefore be updated by introducing a dispute settlement mechanism that even provides for the use of sanctions in the event of serious human rights violations; and the European Union should support the Central American states to promote legislative reforms aimed at preventing and eradicating widespread phenomena such as child labour and violence against trade unionists, human rights defenders or indigenous peoples.

In this respect, it would be worth identifying potential sectors that should be encouraged for more exchanges. Parliament has repeatedly encouraged the Commission to strengthen the monitoring and implementation of trade and sustainable development chapters, including an effective mechanism for enforcing commitments in the field of labour standards and environmental protection. I am therefore convinced that the Commission's 15-point plan in this area is a step in the right direction.

Mr President, Commissioner, the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, established in 2006, is a solidarity fund, which is important to point out, which provides assistance to workers who are victims of corporate restructuring linked to the opening of the economy to globalisation. For more than a decade, this fund has been able to support more than 150,000 workers in more than 150 cases of corporate restructuring, and in most Member States. In addition, there are 4,000 NEETs, those young people who are not trained and have no jobs, and who today have also benefited from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. Despite an initially available budget of 500 million euros per year, its use has remained low, not because its action is irrelevant, quite the contrary, but because its organization is complex. Moreover, the commission's proposal was well received by the European Parliament. It has been changed a little at the margin, but there has generally been a broad consensus to be able to work on this proposal on your part. Indeed, the threshold for the number of workers affected was too large and we worked on that reduction. You have proposed a threshold of eligibility; we propose to set it at 200 workers, not 200 workers from the same company but 200 affected workers in several companies. On the other hand, globalization is not the only adjustment factor in our economy. Technological changes, energy transitions and ecological transitions, which are also important in the context of corporate restructuring, must also be taken into account. Co-financing must also be a determining factor, or the multi-sector or multi-regional approach. All these changes are aimed at improving the effectiveness of the fund currently known as the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund, which we propose to call the Transition Fund. I would like to add a dimension that could not be taken into account in the fund, but for which I will table an amendment in plenary tomorrow. For while it is important to help workers in the context of a restructuring - I would even say that it is essential, because if globalisation makes a winner, it also makes a loser and European solidarity is necessary - it also seems useful, in the context of a major restructuring, in a region of Europe weakened, for example, by high unemployment rates or low employment rates. , or even in regions affected successively by several restructurings, it also seems important to me to help local economic actors cope with traumas such as major corporate restructurings, to reposition and remobilize the strengths, strategies and intelligences of a territory. I often give the example of the caterpillar company in Belgium, in Charleroi, which actually created retraining cells to accompany workers, to give them the opportunity to find a job, but which also created a cell - the CATCH cell - which was added to the conversion cell. Bringing together universities, businesses and local economic players, it has helped to retrain and remobilize forces after a trauma like this. As a result, the employment rate of workers, as well as the wealth of the territory, have been improved.  Therefore, I will propose this amendment tomorrow because it is true that it has sometimes been difficult to convince my colleagues to go in this direction. It is an amendment that should help us to take territorial development into account. However, this territorial development in Europe is extremely important. There are rich territories in Europe, and there are neglected territories, and we cannot leave them alone in this despair. So I think it is important to be able to table this amendment and support it. I hope that I will have the support of the various groups for this amendment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 321, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, since 2007 the European Globalisation Fund has been a key European instrument to show solidarity with workers who have lost their jobs due to globalisation, related changes in world trade patterns or the global financial and economic crisis. Since its launch in 2007, the Fund has mobilised EUR 631 million for 160 cases targeting almost hundred 150 000 dismissed workers, including NEETs in the most recent years at least. But the world of work has changed significantly since then, and it is high time to update the EGF Regulation to reflect better the current economic and social context. Therefore, I am pleased to see that, overall, the European Parliament supports our proposal for the Globalisation Fund Regulation for the next MFF. In particular, I welcome the fact that Parliament supports the wider scope and the lowering of the thresholds that we proposed. I warmly thank the rapporteur, Ms Maria Arena, and all the members of the Employment Committee and the associated committee for their hard work on this file and I particularly welcome the speed with which Parliament proceeded. Parliament has made various amendments, and I welcome a number of them as they clarify our texts or usefully add to or change elements. On some other amendments we have hesitations, and I’m grateful for the possibility to mention two of them here. One of the key features of our proposal was the accelerated mobilisation procedures. Reintroducing the same mobilisation procedures as in the current regulation will make it impossible to reduce the length of the procedure, and therefore we would lose the opportunity to mobilise the funds and actually help displaced workers more swiftly.  We also have hesitations as regards the further lowering of the threshold of these placements and extending the reference periods. The EGF interventions are justified by the major adverse shock on the local economy caused by dismissals. If we further reduce the already low threshold proposed by the Commission – we go from 500 to 250 in our proposal – then we risk diluting the argument of a major shock and call into question the EU added value.

Dear Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your support. As responsible for the opinion given by the Committee on Regional Development to the Globalisation Adjustment Fund, my work was guided by three objectives. Firstly, reduce the current redundancy threshold of 250 to 150. Secondly, the beneficiaries should be extended to workers who have not yet been laid off, but their dismissal has already been decided.

Initially, the fund was intended to provide support to people who lose their jobs due to structural changes due to globalisation or the financial and economic crisis. In my country, I think everyone knows the example of Ford Genk or, more recently, Caterpillar, as our rapporteur mentioned.  After a decade, we have to admit that the fund was in need of a thorough overhaul. I would like to congratulate the Commissioner on the good proposal. The budget was not used up for a long time and the instrument was actually partially missing its target. One of the problems clearly appeared to be the scope: that was far too scary. That's why we're expanding the scope with automation and digitisation.  In addition, a round of redundancies had to be at least 500 redundancies. In some, mostly less populated areas, that threshold was still far too high. It is precisely in those regions that extra training, extra reorientation is most needed. So the accessibility really had to go up. That is why I am pleased that we in Parliament have succeeded in reducing it to 200.  But we also want to reduce the administrative burden considerably. We will now only have to count redundancies in a particular area and sector to know whether they are eligible. That makes sense: a fired employee wants a new job as soon as possible. No comprehensive analysis of job loss is required.  Last but not least, the European Transition Fund will take into account the impact of Brexit.

Digitalisation and automation bring pressure for change in many sectors. A lot of people fear for their jobs. The new, more flexible fund will respond better to new challenges and help employees better equip themed for future needs. The Fund is by nature a crisis fund. However, many of the Commission's reform proposals would make substantial changes to this and must be treated with certain reservations. For example, it has now been possible to apply for support for redundancies of more than 500 people. The Commission would halve the threshold, and Parliament has had a desire to reduce it to as many as 200. It is true that in many regions of the EU the majority work in small and medium-sized enterprises. They are affected by the crisis throughout the region. However, the criteria should not be over-loosened. If the Fund provides support for an increasing number of ever smaller projects, the Crisis Fund is in danger of becoming something of a non-stop tool. Small projects require as much governance as large ones, so the number of administrations would increase. This fund responds to unforeseen circumstances.

In this respect, the Globalisation Fund – or, as proposed by the Committee on Employment, the Transition Fund – should work closely with the European Social Fund Plus, which is also intended to finance projects that prepare workers for new challenges. Experts estimate that many jobs may soon disappear due to automation, so the fund should respond to these challenges.

The text presented by the Commission has also been of great help, as the merger of several funds within the European Social Fund, keeping its specific objectives intact, will help to reduce administrative barriers and simplify procedures. The linkage to the European Semester will give Member States flexibility to focus on the aspects they consider most necessary. We must remember that our citizens are the greatest asset that the Union has and that they must therefore be at the heart of our policies. It is true that economic recovery is a fact, but much remains to be done. Employment levels, particularly among young people, need to be increased, education and training systems modernized to meet labour market needs and lifelong learning, especially among older workers, need to be strengthened, and we need to combat poverty and social exclusion. But I would like to highlight the following points in the report. The percentage of funding that the ESF+ will allocate to social inclusion measures is increased to 27%, creating its own target groups such as the Roma community. An additional 3% will be allocated to support the most disadvantaged groups through basic material and food assistance and through accompanying measures aimed at improving their integration and participation in society. Young people are also the future of the Union and, therefore, its inclusion in society and the labour market is a priority for us. We propose that all Member States allocate at least 3% of their resources to nini support measures and that the Member States most affected, i.e. those with a rate above the European average, or above 15%, allocate at least 15%. Child poverty is another key point in the report. 26.4% of children in the Union are at risk of social exclusion. These are unacceptable rates. Child poverty hinders children's personal development and hinders their full inclusion in society. If we want to ensure that all European citizens enjoy equal opportunities, we have to work since childhood. That is why we are asking for the creation of a children's guarantee of 5.9 billion euros. Equality between men and women is another important item in the report. Article 6 sets out the necessary provisions to ensure their respect while proposing specific actions aimed at increasing women's participation in society. Full integration of people with disabilities is another key point. In addition to the continuing mentions in the United Nations Convention or respect for the principle of non-discrimination, the fund has its own specific objective of increasing accessibility to improve its inclusion in employment, education and training. And to conclude this first speech, I would like to talk about the social economy company. For the first time, a shared and common concept of social economy is introduced in the Regulation which will ensure greater legal certainty and serve other companies, particularly in countries such as Spain, Italy and Portugal, where the ESF is key, in their work with the most vulnerable people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 350, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Cristian-Silviu BUŞOI", "mepid": "38420", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. – Mr President, since 2003, the European Union has had three health sanctions programmes, which have had very good results.

The ENVI Commission supported the continuation of a separate health programme, which would have given a strong signal that health is a priority, especially since, according to the latest Eurobarometer, the majority of European citizens support the increased intervention of the European Union in the field of health. Regardless of whether it is a separate programme or part of the Social Fund, the most important thing is to have clear objectives and they are to be met. The main proposals adopted by the ENVI Commission, which had exclusive competences over the health component, were: increasing the health budget to EUR 473 million, access to sustainable and affordable quality care services, patient-centreding, encouraging disease prevention, early diagnosis, promoting lifelong health and setting up a Health Steering Committee, effectively developing work plans and maximising synergies with other programmes and tools in health is integrated.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 8, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 351, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I warmly welcome the political commitment shown and the hard work done by the European Parliament, the lead and the associated committees and, in particular, the rapporteur, Ms Lope Fontagné, in the swift preparation of Parliament’s report. You have really done your utmost to advance this legislative proposal within the term of this Parliament. I am very pleased that Parliament largely shares the Commission’s ambitions and objectives for the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+), an integrated fund with a substantial budget to implement the principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights, and linked to the European Semester. It is also a fund with simpler and more flexible management, and this will create more added value for its end-users, i.e. our citizen: for example, in modernising and improving the labour markets, ensuring good healthcare, targeting the assistance to those who need it most, and contributing to an overall stronger social dimension of the European Union. In short, the ESF+ will contribute to a more social Europe. Parliament has proposed various amendments. I welcome a number of them as they clarify our text or usefully add or change elements of it. There are some others on which we have hesitation. The thematic concentration requirements – in plain words, the earmarking of parts of the budget – are the focus of most of Parliament’s proposed amendments. Let me underline here that, in our view, pre-allocating ESF+ national envelopes even further than in our proposal would significantly reduce the flexibility of the fund. This would prevent Member States reacting to evolving social needs, something we know happens in reality. It would also limit the possibility of responding to particular issues which Member States are facing and which are identified in the European Semester process.  Turning to the specific amendment proposals related to the employment and social innovation (ESI) strand of the ESF+, our proposal seeks to bring this strand closer to the ESF. I note with satisfaction that Parliament supports the proposed merger of the funds. But let me again highlight the need for flexibility as we proposed it for the ESI strand. Re-introducing fixed percentages for sub-strands would reduce this flexibility and hence make it more difficult to react to new challenges. Last, but not least, Parliament, in particular the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), proposes significant amendments to the health strand for the ESF+. I note that many of these proposals seem to reflect a desire to keep the health programme as a separate instrument, as it is today. While respecting Parliament’s view, the Commission is convinced that greater synergies and coherence between programmes, and closer coordination and consistency, will maximise the impact of EU health measures and will benefit citizens, health professionals and policymakers.  The new architecture of the ESF+ will not only preserve a specific health strand, which will continue to support public health policies to fulfil the objective of ensuring a high level of health protection, but will also ensure that, wherever they are relevant, health aspects are addressed in all social spending.

This problem does not stop at the Erasmus programme, which we so much love, and that is precisely why we want to significantly develop it. I am therefore very pleased that we in Parliament have been able to agree to support the desired development of Erasmus in the future by improving the use of ESF+ in education, by creating synergies between the European Social Fund and the Erasmus programme.  Funds will be used to prepare disadvantaged learners appropriately and actively for mobility experiences and to increase their participation in cross-border learning experiences. This is an important innovation, because education is one of the most important prerequisites for breaking the eternal cycle of poverty.

It is also important not to be repulsed by the rigid rules of Member States' initiatives in shared management, including the financing of transnational cooperation operations, and above all to ensure a consistent interpretation and transparency of the rules.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 361, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Jasenko SELIMOVIC", "mepid": "134243", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, allow me to thank the rapporteur, co-rapporteurs and the Commission for their good work on an important file.

Crises will happen in the next period as well – like in this one – and it is important to have flexibility in order to cope with them successfully.

Brexit also means the end of cross-border cooperation. Interreg actually means exactly the opposite. As a resident of a border region in eastern Belgium, I speak from my own experience when I say that this Interreg programme has been contributing for many years – it was launched in 1990 – to the fact that many border regions have become common areas. That remains very important. Border barriers – also and above all in people's minds – must continue to be overcome piece by piece. That is why this report is also symbolically important.  As the negotiator of this Parliament, I have been very much in favour of further promoting cross-border cooperation. We have had to deal with 946 amendments and we have drawn up 46 compromise proposals, which has resulted in all parties unanimously adopting this report when they voted in committee. Because – and this was a bit of the leitmotif of all – border regions must not be dead ends, but must reflect a living Europe. In this sense, the Interreg support programme stands for the opposite of foreclosure. With our report, therefore, we as a Parliament are sending out a clear signal. For example, the Commission planned to fix the total amount of funding of EUR 8.4 billion for the forthcoming funding period. However, even if this will only be determined later in the MFF negotiations, we have already provided for an estimated EUR 11.1 billion, which means that we have increased the budget, because that is important to us. It is important that cross-border cooperation can be practised without cuts, as is currently the case. We are of a very clear opinion that there must be no cuts.  Cross-border cooperation is vital for the whole of Europe, especially at a time when there is an increasing need to raise internal borders. People at the borders – many of them cross-border workers – simply do not understand why there are still obstacles at the borders. It is precisely these people who first notice what works in Europe and what does not.  Interreg projects are in many cases also pilot projects for a stronger integration of our regions. They create solutions to very specific problems between different regions and border regions. This way of finding a solution is what Europe really needs.  It was also important to us, when dealing with the legislative proposal, simply promoting practical cross-border projects. It was important to us that more money was provided. It was important to us that the promoters do not have to change their structures on the ground. These have worked well over the years. Why change what works well? We should not do this. Quite the opposite. It was also important to us that the so-called micro-projects, the people-to-people projects, such as cooperation between associations across the border, can be defined as an integral part of the programme and can also be implemented more easily.  Overall, I am pleased that we have written a very practical text that has nothing to do with the often invoked Brussels ivory tower. The proposals came from local stakeholders. We have worked very well with the Committee of the Regions and the Economic and Social Committee. We need to reduce controls and paperwork, which is really a hurdle for many associations, companies and organisations. That is what we have to do now. I believe that the Commission's proposals also went in the right direction.  We have also defined the criteria in such a way that they prepare for the future. In other words, we have defined criteria for dealing with problems relating to the promotion of SMEs, the security situation and climate change. All of this means that we have to define this Interreg programme as a symbol.

On behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Arimont, and the shadow rapporteurs for the quality of this report and for your ongoing support for European Territorial Cooperation (ETC), also known as Interreg. The Commission also wishes to praise the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) for having worked swiftly. With the tight schedule ahead of us, it is indeed paramount to be ready and steady when the next programming period starts. The Commission is confident that the Council will do its utmost to maintain the momentum on this important file, enabling the launch of negotiations soon. This is all the more important as European Territorial Cooperation embodies the very essence of our European project: getting together beyond boundaries to address common challenges.  Allow me to highlight some of the key novelties of our proposals. The aim is to revisit the Interreg architecture of programmes so as to reduce overlaps and fragmentation, thereby increasing the impact on the territories targeted by the programmes. Here the proposal underlines the importance of functional areas such as sea basins. At the same time, the proposal provides means to preserve cross—border or bilateral cooperation, notably in the maritime sector. The aim of the proposal is also to reinforce the strategic dimension of the future programmes by linking them more strongly with existing strategic framework policy initiatives and finally, to radically simplify the whole framework in order to dedicate fewer resources to administrative and control tasks and focus much more on results and real impact. The Commission appreciates that you recognise this important effort to simplify and calls upon you to work together to maintain these simplification measures. Finally, in Interreg programmes the cross-border cooperation will focus more than before on institutional cooperation, resolving border issues and investing in joint services of public interest. Overall, by mainstreaming and simplifying European Territorial Cooperation, we can strengthen it and take it to another level.

Mr President, I do think that it is not today that cross-border cooperation is something of the past, but of today. If you look in Northern Ireland alone – where we have recently been with a delegation – what it means in sparsely populated areas to actually introduce cooperation with universities and schools, new technology, energy generation and so on, then you need each other in the border areas.  Border areas are the scars of the past and then you see what that means. But in some other areas, for example, those Interreg programmes have enabled them to continue and achieve higher education, for example in some other areas, which have not been prioritised, such as London, in Scotland. Twenty years ago, a base for today's economy.  In the enlargement of the Union, the experience seen in the so-called old Member States was immediately applied there. You saw how people wanted to work together in languages, in everyday things.  Two more comments. So it's not obsolete at all, it's very, very modern. And certainly also the almost EUR 1 billion that is now being made available for these interregional, innovative projects. Sometimes projects are too small to do them together directly on the sides of the border, but you look for another region or city to make pace, creating scale, for example for 3D printing. Applying new technologies more quickly, and that is what the Commission's new initiative has brought into territorial cooperation here. I think that's a great initiative.

Mr President, cross-border cooperation is one of the most visible expressions of European cooperation. The Interreg programmes have been doing a good job for decades to promote this, to get people to work across borders, to allow people to use each other's facilities or to better connect infrastructure across borders.  I am therefore pleased that the European Parliament intends to allocate EUR 11 billion to financially support cross-border cooperation. That money is also badly needed, because we are also going to support something new in the future. It has already been said that the so-called interregional innovative investments.  Nearly €1 billion will be allocated to joint innovative investments by knowledge institutions, companies and governments based in various European countries. This means that we will join forces at European level to develop and bring new products and services to market. In addition, the location of the investment is no longer a guide to the financial support given from Europe, but the way in which an investment can create as much European added value as possible. By investing together in innovation on a European scale, the European Union can become more competitive on a global scale with, for example, the United States or China. This results in more cooperation and more cohesion in Europe, but ultimately also more European jobs, more growth, more prosperity.

It is good that we are accompanying the report with a debate – a debate – because it deserves it, even though it is now midnight.

After all, there is hardly a European policy area that is so committed to the European idea of cross-border cooperation and cohesion – the internal cohesion of the European Union – as the objective of European territorial cooperation. Although national borders have become largely porous, there are still different legal systems and administrative structures between the Member States of the European Union, which make cross-border cooperation more difficult for citizens in border regions.  The Interreg programmes can help here, and they have helped to ensure that citizens can jointly solve problems and implement projects across state borders in the often structurally weak border areas. This regulation is intended to form the basis for further support for cross-border cooperation for the next funding period. In doing so, we must ensure that the possibilities for cooperation are not reduced, but extended, that the financial resources made available are not reduced, but at least maintained. Bureaucracy that has been built up in recent years must be reduced. And a major step forward in the new regulation is that territorial cooperation is no longer confined to the Member States of the European Union, but can be linked to the instruments of the Neighbourhood Policy and development cooperation.

In this context, I appreciate the efforts of some mayors in Romania, who have created the \"Western Alliance\", calling for increased powers to manage European funding in order to strengthen territorial cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 399, "date": "2019-01-15.json", "name": "Rosa D'AMATO", "mepid": "124835", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are particularly pleased with the work that has been done.  The Commission's original proposal contained a number of critical issues, on which we successfully intervened in the amending and negotiating phase. Firstly, we have given the cross-border maritime programmes the right importance, bringing them back to the first axis of 'cross-border cooperation'. We have increased the total share of resources allocated to Interreg – almost 11 billion – and raised both the EU co-financing threshold to 80 %, and the pre-financing rates, thus giving regional and local authorities the liquidity they need to finance projects on the ground.  I call on all my fellow Members, and in particular those who are interested in changing the absurd rules of current economic governance, to vote in favour of the two amendments tabled by the Movement for the Break-up from the calculation of the national cofinancing deficit.

The Commission takes note of the views of Parliament expressed during the discussion and I want to thank you specifically for your support regarding the promotion of interregional innovation investments. The Commission is also confident that, based on previous experience, there will be a high demand for these resources. Good work has been done so far. Today we want to make sure that we can continue in a simpler, more efficient framework and the Commission is confident that Parliament will be a strong partner in this endeavour. Thank you very much for your hard work and I very much hope, and am confident, that under the Romanian Presidency the Council will, for its part, advance also further on our Interreg proposal with a view to its adoption in 2019, well in time for the next programing round. I am sure that you all know how important that is also.  Thank you very much and also for having stayed here for the debate, and I wish you a good night.

Thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs who have been actively involved in getting such a sensible text in place during the negotiations and during the shadow meetings. Thanks to the Commission, which has been actively involved in this process, has always been by our side. I would also like to link this with the request that we get the Romanian Presidency so motivated that it can draw up its general approach in the very short term, so that we can get into the trialogue and try to get this text negotiated as far as possible before the new Parliament has to bend further over this text. The aim must be that this text is clear for the new funding period and that the agencies and all the actors on the ground have a text for which they can prepare as quickly as possible, so that the programmes can be implemented very quickly on the ground.
