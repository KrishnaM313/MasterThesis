It's good to be back. It takes leaving the Parliament to arrive at the podium. I am glad to see friends and feel the positive atmosphere of Strasbourg. It is my pleasure as Prime Minister of the Republic of Croatia to speak today about the future of Europe. This year Croatia will mark its fifth year of membership in the European Union. This is an occasion to recall our demanding accession process, as well as the fact that the European Community recognised Croatia internationally on 15 January 1992. It returned to the political map of the world after nine centuries as an independent state, to the intersection of Central Europe and the Mediterranean. Croatian people, that day, as well as the day of accession to the European Union, still remember today with a lot of emotions. The fall of the Berlin Wall marked the rejection of communism and the victory of democracy across Central and Eastern Europe. Although we also sought to return to the auspices of democratic Europe, this period and events in the early nineteenth were extremely unfavorable and difficult for Croatia. At the end of the twentieth century in the heart of Europe we were unfortunately forced to defend our freedom from military aggression. The siege and destruction of Vukovar, the first European city destroyed after World War II. The bombing of medieval Dubrovnik. Thousands killed, wounded and hundreds of thousands displaced permanently marked this painful period. In the war that ended in 1995. Croatia suffered damages reaching 150% of pre-war GDP. You can only imagine how much this has slowed our social and economic transformation. Even though we were among the more developed transition economies before the war, in the 1990s, because of all of the above, we lost a step in relation to others and entered the European Union in 2013 instead, if not any of that war, probably 2004. It took almost a quarter century for Croatia to recover, change and develop, rebuild, build and today become one of Europe's most attractive tourist destinations, visited by 18 million guests last year. Tourism today represents almost 20% of our GDP and we are the first in Europe by the number of tourists per capita. As prominent elements of our cultural heritage, invention, innovation, I will remind you that Croatia has 23 listed goods on the UNESCO World Heritage List, on our city, Rijeka, which will be the European Capital of Culture in 2020, to the Croatian tie, which, as we see here, won the world even long ago, as on Nikola Tesla, a native of Croatia, without whose inventions we would be sitting here today in the dark. Today, one of the fastest electric cars in the world is produced in Croatia. One Croatian company enables 4 billion people in the world to communicate digitally via SMS. At the same time, I am aware that a number of demanding structural reforms are ahead of us that need to provide a better quality life for our citizens. My government is determined to implement them. We have positive macroeconomic indicators. We record economic growth of 3%, growth in industrial production, investment, exports, as well as growth in employment, wages and social benefits. We have significantly reduced public debt, achieved budget surplus and have the lowest unemployment so far. In addition to the efforts of the Government, this also reflects the positive effects of Croatian membership in the European Union. Moreover, as the Government that won the election in 2016 on a pro-European agenda, we are actively rethinking the future of our common Union. Mesdames et Messieurs, j'ai consacré 25 ans d'action politique et de travail professionnel afin que la Croatie moderne fasse siennes les valeurs européennes. Mes compatriotes qui ont, hélas, eu à connaître la guerre n'en apprécient aujourd'hui la paix que davantage. Il n'y a pas si longtemps, la démocratie n'était qu'une aspiration lointaine, alors qu'aujourd'hui nous vivons les valeurs et les libertés européennes. Nous avons un souvenir très clair de ce que signifie ne pas pouvoir bénéficier des mêmes chances de développement économique et social, de liberté de circulation, d'échange d'étudiants ou d'innovation technologique, si bien qu'aujourd'hui nous mesurons parfaitement toute la valeur ajoutée et les avantages que nous procure l'appartenance à l'Union européenne. Je le mesure d'autant mieux que j'ai moi-même activement œuvré aux négociations d'adhésion de la Croatie et conduit la campagne référendaire pour notre entrée dans l'Union. Durant un an, cela a été pour moi l'occasion d'aller au contact de mes concitoyens afin de leur expliquer les bénéfices de l'adhésion. Ainsi, avec ma double expérience de député croate et européen, mais aussi celle de premier ministre et de membre du Conseil européen, je mesure parfaitement les différents intérêts qui cherchent à affaiblir et à fragmenter le projet européen. Sans perdre le sens des réalités politiques, je pense qu'il est essentiel de renouveler ensemble les idées européennes, en renforçant nos politiques communes et en faisant un usage intelligent de nos ressources budgétaires, le but étant que nos concitoyens ne soient pas indifférents à l'Europe, voire hostiles à son égard. Au contraire, ils doivent en ressentir tous les bénéfices, se l'approprier et prendre activement part à la poursuite de sa construction, car il y va avant tout de leur intérêt. Nos concitoyens doivent percevoir plus clairement les bénéfices que l'appartenance à l'Union leur apporte au quotidien. Ils doivent mieux saisir l'enjeu de notre action, de quelle manière, et surtout à quelle fin, nous la conduisons au niveau européen. Enfin, ils doivent en réaliser la finalité, qui est de mieux servir l'intérêt général en joignant nos forces. Nous devons montrer par des actes concrets que les institutions européennes agissent pour chacun de nos concitoyens. Cela ne peut se faire qu'avec le soutien du Parlement européen. Aussi, je vais tâcher de vous livrer ma vision pour l'avenir de notre Europe. J'aimerais aborder les défis auxquels nous devons faire face, la nécessité de renforcer notre légitimité démocratique, nos priorités extérieures ainsi que les politiques internes cruciales, qu'il nous faut soutenir par des moyens budgétaires appropriés. Signore e signori, la riunione a Roma dello scorso 25 marzo, con la quale abbiamo celebrato il 60° anniversario dei trattati di Roma e adottato la dichiarazione che indica la via al nostro futuro comune, è stata un passaggio importante per la discussione che ci troviamo ad affronttamo ad affronttamo oggi sul futuro Dell'Europa. Quasi un anno fa, noi leader europei siamo fit invitati e incoraggiati dal Santo Padre a perseverare nel cercare di restituire la speranza ai nostri cittadini e a continuare ad adoperarci per il loro benessere. In quell'occasione, il Presidente Tajani ha tenuto un brillante discorso, per il quale vorrei ancora una volta congratularmi con lui. Sicurezza, terrorismo, attacchi cibernetici, scontri nelle aree vicine, cambiamenti demografici e migrazioni in aumento, cambiamenti climatici, disuguaglianze sociali e gap digitale: queste sono le sfide che affrontiamo quotidianamente e che impongono la necessità di adeguarvi le principali decisioni strategiche. Al giorno d'oggi queste sfide acquistano una nuova dimensione e pongono davanti a noi un nuovo compito: essere uniti nel dare la risposta. L'unità però non deve intendersi meramente come la somma numerica dei paesi membri, ma deve essere rafforzata dalle nostre particolarità nazionali e dai raggiungimenti individuali. La stessa unità deve rispecchiarsi nelle nostre politiche e bilancio comuni, a nonché nelle attività e nell'operato sinergico tra le istituzioni europee e gli Stati membri. Negli anni passati, y processi elettorali in varie parti d'Europa sono stand in buona parte contrassegnati dalla crescita del populismo e dell'euroscetticismo, come diretta conseguenza delle sfide di cui ho parlato. Dopo aver dimostrato che siamo in grado di affrontale con successo, è importante proseguire sulla stessa strada per arrivare pronti alle elezioni del 2019 e per consolidare la fede nel progetto europeo. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we must also work together to find answers to challenges posed by the United King's Withdrawal from the European Union. As I have repeatedly said on many occasions since 2013, before the referendum, I see this as a bad decision. It was a lose-lose situation for the United Kingdom and for the European Union as a whole. As a European, I respect the decision but I regret it. The UK's exit is a result of populism and a campaign of disinformation, demonstrating the consequences that a lack of information about the EU has for its citizens. I hope that the procedure in accordance with Article 50 will lead to an agreement on orderly withdrawal, ensuring legal security and clarity for citizens and business communities on both sides. It is particularly important to settle the rights of citizens on the basis of equal treatment. This means that Croatian citizens too must be treated equally when it comes to their access to the UK labour market. We must maintain unity in the process of negotiations, and our future relationship should be based on our mutual interests. In further building a European project, it is important to ensure democratic legitimacy. The European Parliament represents the strongest link between decisions at European level and our citizens, and we need to further strengthen this link. I therefore support the continued application of the concept of spitzencandidates through which citizens can more easily recognise the face and ideas of the future president of the European Commission, such as my friend Jean-Claude Juncker, as a spitzenkandidat on the EPP winner list in 2014. In the context of the debate on amending electoral legislation, we should ask ourselves whether we are at the level of Member States, given the weather restriction, sufficiently organizational, legally and financially ready for the establishment of transnational lists. I welcome the proposal prepared by the European Parliament on its new composition, according to which Croatia receives an additional MEP. National parliaments also have an important place in strengthening the democratic legitimacy of the European Union. Therefore, after returning to Zagreb, I introduced the practice of plenary debate in the Croatian Parliament after each formal meeting of the European Council. This gives me the opportunity to introduce MEPs and my fellow citizens to the most important European topics, thus contributing to the European trend of dialogue with citizens, which I strongly support. In our further work, I think that we need to strengthen the application of the principle of subsidiarity and proportionality and make decisions as close as possible to our fellow citizens and therefore welcome the establishment of a special working group. A few words about the policy of enlargement. Croatia is a testament to the transformative strength that the perspective of membership in the European Union carries, but also a proof that the Union is a peace project that strongly contributes to reconciliation and confidence building. It is precisely this attractive strength that we need to use to make our environment better and more resilient, and thus make ourselves stronger, safer and more prosperous. The European Union continues to be a community that many want to join, namely my six neighbouring countries in Southeast Europe, their closest neighbours, but also Turkey, but not only them but also part of our wider neighbourhood. I know of the ambitions of our friends in Ukraine, a country I followed daily while working here alongside you. Promises to candidates and potential candidates should be fulfilled just as those states need to meet the set conditions and criteria and implement the necessary reforms, always with the evaluation of the individual achievements of each of these states. Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren! Es freut mich, dass die Europäische Kommission gerade heute eine neue Erweiterungsstrategie für den Westbalkan vorstellen wird. In dieser strategie gilt es vor allem, Bosnia and Herzegovina besondere Aufmerksamkeit zu widmen, das genauso wie Kroatien eine schwere Wegstrecke hinter sich gelassen hat. Es ist ein Staat mit einer spezifischen Staatsordnung, bestehend aus drei constitutiven Völkern — Kroaten, Bosniaken und Serben —, deren gleichberechtigte Stellung zusammen mit den anderen Volksgruppen die Grundlage für die Zukunft ist. Erst mit der festen Verankerung im europäischen Wertverständnis kann Bosnien-Herzegowina seinen Bürgern eine sichere und stabile Zukunft garantieren. Das wünscht sich auch der Großteil seiner Bürger, und zwar auf der Grundlage einer gleichberechtigten Wahlgesetzgebung. In unserer europäischen Nachbarschaft, im östlichen und südlichen Teil Europas, stehen wir vor großen sicherheitspolitischen Herausforderungen. Deshalb ist es das strategische interesse aller EU-Mitgliedstaaten, seinen Nachbarn bei der Festigung und dem Ausbau einer prosperierenden, friedensorientierten, stabilen und vor allem demokratischen Staatsordnung zu helfen. Das ist der Einsatz den wir alle geben müssen, um den Schutz und die Sicherheit der europäischen Bürger zu gewährleisten. Ladies and gentlemen, many challenges and threats seek a stronger, more engaged and assertive role for the European Union in global relations. A commitment to an international order based on respect for democracy, internationalist law, the rule of law and human rights is a key investment in strengthening the role of the Union as a global factor and promoter of multilateralism. To achieve our global ambitions, we need a stronger, more effective common foreign security and defence policy. Equally important is our development assistance, which, as global leaders, contribute to the fulfilment of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. We have the resources to do that, and I believe the political will to make it happen. Terrorist attacks on European soil, as well as other threats, show that Europe is vulnerable and that its security should be taken care of within and outside its borders. This will contribute further strengthening our defense capabilities and cooperation in the security and defense field. Therefore, I welcome the establishment of permanent structured cooperation in whose projects, namely five concrete ones, Croatia will participate. Strengthening cooperation and coordination with the North Atlantic Alliance remains crucial, while ensuring compatibility, synergy and effectiveness of joint action. Protecting the Union's external borders is one of our most important tasks. The measures we are taking to this end at European level should ensure equal treatment of all members and all citizens. Full implementation of systematic checks at the border between members when only one of them is in the Schengen area, which is the example of Croatia and Slovenia or Croatia and Hungary, has shown that there may be a problem for freedom of movement within the European Union, but with open and sincere cooperation and partnership between these three countries we have successfully solved these problems. Croatia is already making its contribution to border protection, and our next major key European goal is to enter the Schengen area. Therefore, in this we also support our friends from Bulgaria and Romania. Our ambition is to fulfil the Schengen criteria as soon as possible and thus pave the way for a Council decision, while I expect your support here in the European Parliament. This is important for Croatia, it is important for the security of the whole European Union and these issues must not be linked to any other unrelated processes or topics. The particular challenge of past years is the migration one, which has not only a security but also a humanitarian dimension. While we are recording a reduced number of entrances to the territory of the European Union, we still need to be vigilant and continue to invest in our own capacity to cope with this challenge as well as to help source countries of migration. To successfully respond to this challenge, it is necessary to complete the reform of the European asylum system. Solidarity, in my deep opinion, should remain one of the foundations of our joint action. In this spirit, in which twenty-five years ago every sixth inhabitant in to my country being an exile or refugee, Croatia conducts its share of responsibility for the policy of resettlement and resettlement. Mr. President, the European Union accounted for a third of the world's GDP in 2004, and today accounts for less than its quarter. It is therefore necessary to continue to work towards concluding trade deals with third countries as this is a stake in the further economic growth and prosperity of our people. It is important to strengthen relations with key strategic partners and further deepen transatlantic ties. One of our greatest achievements is the internal market. It is at the heart of the European project and is crucial for the competitiveness of our economy. After years of deadlock due to the global financial crisis and recession, economic growth has returned. In Davos two weeks ago, we noted that it is growing worldwide, growing European, but I am glad that the Croatian economy is growing, and it is important to keep this trend. Measures arising from the Single Market Strategy are our common responsibility, and in the internal market it is necessary to stop discriminatory practice of standards in the quality of food and other products because we cannot have two categories of consumers within our Union. With the intensification of measures to deepen the internal market in all respects, it is necessary to adapt it to modern challenges, especially the digital age in which we live. Therefore, we need to build a functional, single digital market as soon as possible, to give a boost to new jobs, increase investment competitiveness and innovation. Croatia contributes to this development of public electronic services, we have 685 of them, and we are particularly proud of those such as e-prescription in health care, which other countries have recognized, as well as e-newborn service, which since last week has enabled child birth reports online. Mr. President, in 1960 every seventh inhabitant of the world lived on the territory of the European Union, while today only every fifteenth inhabitant of the world lives in it. According to Eurostat, in 2060 in this area will live only every twentieth inhabitant of the world is evidence of the worsening demographic picture of Europe, which causes numerous challenges for our countries, including in the field of labour and social policy. One of our achievements is our social model, which we need to further improve, fostering dialogue with social partners and social cohesion. We are facing the application of the principle of the European Pillar of Social Rights as the basis for establishing a fair labour market and social security system, as well as caring for our pensioners. We must continue to build a European Energy Union and ensure our citizens access to sustainable, safe and affordable energy. It is therefore important for us to develop strategic energy projects aimed at diversification and security of supply. For Croatia, I especially highlight the project of the LNG terminal on Krk, which is a strategic project of my Government and which has already received financial support from the European Union, thus positioning Croatia on the energy map of Europe. On the other hand, we will fulfill all the obligations of the Paris Agreement and strive to continue on our tradition of the country that had the first hydroelectric power plant in Europe in 1895 to develop the production of electricity coming from renewable sources, and in consumption in Croatia the share from renewable sources It is already at 29%, thus practically ten years earlier we met the European 2030 targets. In terms of transport, I will only single out a strategic project for us, the most visible project financed by the European Union in this multiannual financial framework, which is the project of the Peljesac Bridge that physically connects southern Croatia, Dubrovnik you all know about, with the rest of Croatia and the European Union. Dear friends, all our goals, policies and ambitions or everything we do requires adequate financial resources. In planning the next Multiannual Financial Framework, we need to start from what kind of Union we want. For me it is a Union that ensures the economic growth and development of its members, which is globally competitive, in which employment is growing, and especially the prospects of young people. A Union that encourages the balanced development of Member States, which builds the economic, social and territorial cohesion of our regions, a Union that provides security for its citizens, protects its external borders and is capable of responding to all security threats, a Union that invests in education, culture and Creation, research and development, which adapts to modern challenges and the digital economy, a Union that is financially stable, sustainable and capable of protecting citizens from possible financial crises, guided by the principle of solidarity and finally a Union which is a key political player in global governance, with defense capabilities, free trade promoter, leader in development assistance, environmental protection and the fight against climate change. In the next Multiannual Financial Framework, the basic principle of financing should be European added value. And therefore, we need to keep the elements of the existing system of own funds that work well and that maintain the principles of simplicity and transparency, and in the context of introducing new own funds, we should avoid creating an additional tax burden for citizens. Although Croatia is not yet a member of the euro area, Croatia wants to contribute to the further development of the economic and monetary union. In June 2017, we emerged from the Excessive Budget Deficit procedure and continue to implement a national reform programme aimed at accelerating real convergence towards the euro area and eliminating excessive macroeconomic imbalances. Joining the euro area is Croatia's strategic goal. The government and the Croatian National Bank presented a strategy for introducing the euro, which opened the process of public consultation. Today, Croatia meets almost all the criteria for the introduction of the euro and our goal is to enter the exchange rate mechanism, the so-called Exchange Rate Mechanism 2 as soon as possible. In January this year, the Croatian Parliament ratified the Treaty on Stability, Coordination and governance in the Economic and Monetary Union, and I had the honor of participating in December as the first representative of Croatia at the Euro Summit. In conclusion, I would like to point out that our dialogue on the future of the European Union is as important as the outcome of this process. We saw the reflection documents produced by the Commission, we listened to our citizens, and we talked to each other at the levels of parliaments and governments. Many ideas are discussed and different scenarios are being considered. Our path to the future should be a way forward and not backward. Croatia joined the European Union to be an active and responsible member and to work with other partners to further build and develop the European project. Croatia, which longed so much to be again a part of Europe, today wants to be a part of its inner circle. This is why I place emphasise on Schengen and the eurozone. This is the reason behind our decision to participate in permanent structured cooperation (PESCO), and the reason why our next goals are, as I have said, Schengen and the euro. I work wholeheartedly towards achieving these goals every day, together with colleagues in my government, convinced that this is in the best interests of Croatian citizens. In further building our future, equality is important to all of us: equality of states, citizens and opportunities. For the credibility of the European project and our reputation in the world, it is vital that we act as a family brought together by mutual trust. It is very important that Member States that have differences on bilateral issues approach them in good faith and constructively. Compromise is the building block on which European Union was constructed. Inclusiveness is also important for Croatia. No matter how fast or how much further we advance in these integration processes, each process be open to all members on equal terms. Our achievements are our strongest tools in building our common future. They need to unite us because we can move forward only if we stand together. A strong Europe primarily also means strong Member States, but, at the same time, the pooling of sovereignty at the level of the EU makes our countries stronger, for their benefit and for the benefit of our fellow citizens across our Member States. We also want strong European institutions which, on the basis of their Treaty powers, work for the benefit of every citizen of the Union. In that respect, Croatia is looking forward to its Presidency of the Council, in two years' time in the first half of 2020, as an opportunity further to build and promote the European project. Our priorities will be growth, development, connectivity, security and enlargement. I look forward to working with Romania and Finland — in the trio — and in intensive cooperation with Parliament. Croatia will be taking over the Presidency after the formation of new institutions and our task will be to bring forward new ideas in the period lies which lies ahead of us at the beginning of the next decade. With its values and freedoms, quality and way of life, and the highly competitive social market economy, Europe needs to reassert as a role model that will inspire people across the world to build a better future. Dear friends, it is up to us all to deliver.

Croatia is both an example and an inspiration for what our Union Should aspire to be in the future. Croatia is a young member — not a new member but a young member — of the European Union, but a nation with a long and inspiring history; a nation which has shoot courage in self-defence and show construction when it comes to Europe. With growth now above 3% in 2017 and unemployment set to fall by six percentage points from 2016 to 2019, Croatia is a symbol of what can be experienced by working together in our Union. Working together in our Union is another way to address the budgetary problems we have to face. J'aime bien la rhétorique enthousiaste de presque tous les governments — il y a des exceptions tout de même — lorsqu'il s'agit de l'organisation de l'avenir de l'Europe. Or, il faut mettre en concordance les discours et les réalités budgétaires. L'Europe, telle qu'elle est, avec les aspirations qui sont les siennes, avec les ambitions qu'elle Nourrit, avec les ambitions et les obstacles qu'elle proclame, ne peut pas vivre à l'intérieur du carcan actuel de l'organisation budgétaire. J'ai été longtemps premier ministre et ministre des finances, donc je ne plaiderai pas pour une augmentation du budget sans bornes et sans limits. Tel n'est pas mon propos. Mais je voudrais que nous nous mettions d'accord au cours des onze mois à venir, sur les objectifs de l'Union. Il faut d'abord se mettre d'accord sur le contenu et ensuite sur les chiffres. Je n'aime pas ce débat qui consiste à fixer des limits budgétaires sans avoir évacué — si j'ose dire entre nous —, le débat sur les ambitions futures de l'Europe. d'Abord le contenu, puis les chiffres et non le contraire. Par conséquent, concentrons-nous sur le contenu de nos politiques. (Applaudissements) Évidemment, il y a unanimité au Conseil.

Mais je m'incris en faux contre cette volonté stupide, passagère, irréfléchie qui consiste à organiser un attentat sur les politiques de cohésion et sur la politique agricole commune. ça ne fonctionnera pas et la Commission ne suivra pas ce chemin. Mais là où des économies intelligent peuvent et doivent être faites, nous ferons des propositions dans ce sens. Andrej Plenković a cité plusieurs exemples de politiques de cohésion intelligent. Évidemment, la Commission accompagnera favorite, en mettant à disposition les fonds néessaires, ce project concernant le pont Pelješac. something like that... but we know where it is, and we will support this project, as we support everything which is being done in Dalmatia. Thesis are important Croatian and European projects, and the review for the next budgetary period cannot have as an aim a reduction of the support we are providing for this important Croatian and European project. (Applause from one person) Is there only one Croatian in the room? We want to do it, even without applause. (Applause) You are welcome. Oui, si j'annonçais le financing d'un pont sur la Seine, tout le monde applaudirait, mais ce project en Croatie est aussi important que ceux réalisés en Europe occidentale. Il ne faut pas oubier le développement des nouveaux pays Membres. I wanted a sentence on the enlargement policy of the European Union Union say. We will talk about this today at the Commission meeting, which starts at one o'clock. That's why I'm in a bit of a hurry, because I have to prepare this. We are going to set the Balkans strategy today. I would like to say a few words in this context. It is wrong to say that I or the Commission had said that by 2025 the accession of Serbia and Montenegro must be under the roof. No, this is an indicative date, an encouragement date, so that those concerned will set out consistently. I said when I took office that there would be no enlargements before 2019. This has caused excitement here in the house, which has caused excitement throughout the region. And now this indicative date for Serbia and Montenegro — these are the two most advanced countries — is causing excitement. You have to choose: either or. Either you want enlargement to the Western Balkans and with the Western Balkans, or you don't want it. I would like the Western Balkans to be able to join the European Union if the conditions are met. They are not at the moment, and they are all still far from meeting the conditions. But we need to tackle our partners in the Western Balkans in a handful manner, we must help them to take this difficult path. Croatia has been able to take this difficult path successfully. However, I would also add, given this problem, the border conflict between Croatia and Slovenia, which needs to be resolved — and this is a bilateral problem, but it is also a European problem. The Commission has offered its assistance. This outstretched hand is received only by finger. This problem between Slovenia and Croatia must be addressed as a matter of urgency. (Applause) And the Commission — I agree with Andrej and others here on this — will make an offer to solve this problem. But I Add, also in view of this problem: there will be no further accession of the Western Balkans without the border conflicts being resolved beforehand. (Applause) This game, which consists of saying, “We'll solve the problem sometime after joining,” won't happen a second time — not with me. These problems must be resolved before accession or no further accession will take place. In this respect, Croatia and Slovenia have a responsibility here. The problem must be solved before any other accession occurs. I wanted to make this clear here. Just as clearly and clearly — and I am grateful to Andrej for saying this — I would like to comment on the question of the top candidates. I have an almost established impression that some in the European Council are attributing this tiny democratic progress, which some of us shared responsibility to each other, to what was the state of the Treaty in 1957. We are in 2018, we need more democracy, and I am working very energetically and vigorously to ensure that there will be a top candidate of the major political party families in the next European elections. Whoever turns this back... (Applause) I'm just saying: the danger is great. Although we in this House — most of us — believe that we need these top candidacies, there is almost a majority in the European Council — as I feel, predict — almost a majority against this. This is a conflict between the political parties. This would be a conflict between this House and the European Council, and we must overdraft this conflict in such a way that what we have achieved in 2014 will take place again in 2019, irrespective of the Commission's record. And there is no contradiction between the idea for which I expressed my sympathy, the transnational lists and the Top nominations. Anyone who sees the area of conflict here is — yes — in favour of transnational lists, but actually opposed to the innovation of the top candidates that we introduced in 2014. And that is why we must be close together in terms of top candidacy. We have to do this because this is about the democratic substance of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": " Thank you President.

It is a great thing for us to welcome him back again to this Chamber. And Prime Minister, I would like to thank you, first of all, for your commitment today to your and our vision of a democratic Europe. Your clear idea that Parliament is the place where we decide, especially on the Commission President, is absolutely crucial and clear, and I hope you can convince a lot of your friends and colleagues in the European Council, in a few weeks’ time. Croatia is our newest Member State but Croatia is already a key driver for European integration. Croatia’s achievement proves to all in the region that, through hard work, persistence, political courage and determination, EU membership is not only within reach but also of great benefit to all of us. Croatia is a success story and a model for a lot of Balkan states, so congratulations on what you have achieved, Prime Minister. Colleagues, the idea of today’s debate on the future of Europe with Andrej Plenković (last time it was with Leo Varadkar) is to talk more generally about the future of this continent, our continent, and I want to talk today about identity. I want to talk about nations. For the PPE Group, it is clear that the nation states are the fundament of Europe. Europe is not possible without national pride, the history of our countries and the cultural heritage of our nations, but I think there is more when we talk about identity. When we look at the people of Scotland, South Tyrol, Sicily, and the Basque region, they feel they are British, Italian or Spanish citizens but they are also rooted in their regions. There is a double identity on this continent, so why should there be only national pride? Why should it not be possible to combine this with regional and European pride? Here, in this House, and all over Europe, many politicians from the extreme right are telling people that their nation is the only thing, and to hell with Europe and Brussels. Politically, this is one of the key questions we have to answer in the debate about the future of Europe. I give a clear and personal answer: Bavaria is my home – hundred and fifty years ago we were an independent kingdom as Bavarians. Germany is my nation, with all the beauty and richness of the German culture, but also the unthinkable barbarism of the Nazi time. And I am a European. With heart and mind I love and live the European way of life and I will not allow any extremist or nationalist to hold these identities in contradiction: they belong together. (Applause) Let us look at Croatia when we talk about this. Croatian history has proved over the last centuries that neither big trading powers, such as the Venetian Duchies, nor big empires, such as the Ottoman Empire or the Austro-Hungarian dynasty, nor deals between powerful states behind closed doors at the Vienna Congress, nor fascists nor communists have guaranteed Croatia’s independence and interests. Only a democratic Europe, acting together, has been able to protect self-determination, security, peace and prosperity for the Croatian people. Croatia is the best example when thinking of the future of Europe together as a national identity. There is another important point. Let us imagine for a moment that the nationalists had won – Europe without a European Union, without Brussels or Strasbourg. Does anybody think that medium-sized and small Member States would then have any influence? Prime Minister Plenković has a say today in the European Council because a unanimous decision is necessary. Without such structures and without the European Union, I am sure that an intergovernmental Europe would be organised and led only by Germany, France and a few of the other nations. That is not the idea of Europe. We are equal, we are all Europe, and that is our future idea. So the nationalists are stupid and naive. They have not learned from history and they weaken the power of their own people. Everybody who believes in strong nations must be in favour of a united and democratic Europe. I spoke about identity and I want to add another aspect. When you fly from Lisbon to Tallinn, or when you fly from Helsinki to Sicily, you see a lot of diversity: food, music, languages and traditions. Our continent is so rich and so colourful, and I like it, but we have one thing in common: in the middle of every village, town and city, with only a few exceptions, there is a Christian church. Christmas, Easter and Pentecost are holidays we all share. We have to stick to our Christian heritage. Our democracies, welfare states and social market economies came into being only because of our Christian values of responsibility, solidarity and freedom. We have to protect our European way of life by preserving our Christian values. It is clear that faith is a private thing, but for our societies, and for Europe, there will only be a Europe that sticks to its Christian heritage, or no Europe at all.

Prime Minister, you came to discuss with us the future of Europe and to do this we must know where we come from. Like many of us, you come from a region, the Balkans, which has been at the centre of European history. I would even say it has been its destiny region. Its history has taught that peace in Europe can never be taken for granted. The Balkans also tell us that history does not provide the answers. Moving forward means no longer being obsessed with the wars of the past. A European perspective for the Western Balkans is the right answer. Our Group is supporting this endeavour by the Commission. From your government, Prime Minister, we expect a clear commitment to peace in the Balkans and respect for neighbouring countries’ borders and integrity. We also call on Croatia to respect arbitration decisions between Croatia and Slovenia. History teaches us that a good future is not possible with extreme nationalism and racism. I am deeply worried by the recent racist attacks in Italy and I am sad to say that they could also have happened in other Member States. Our Union is not just a market: it is built on values, the rule of law and democracy, and it does not always deliver. A European democracy needs more open and inclusive institutions. We need bold decisions in order to overcome mistrust and apathy. Let us give our electorate the opportunity to choose a transnational list, giving people the right to choose this democracy. We also support the idea of a Spitzenkandidat for the Commission Presidency, as it improves participation, but we should not be obsessed with institutional reforms. Sometimes it is hard for ordinary people to follow what we are discussing. Institutions must serve the people’s interests and not the other way around. Europe has to deliver by changing our lives for the better. Too many people in Europe are unhappy with the status quo. They want decent jobs, safe pensions and fair treatment when they are sick. All of us want a good future for our children. It is time to engage for a more social Europe, with a European minimum wage, with no social dumping, and with better and longer maternity and paternity leave. This is why the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) will be crucial. Brexit cannot be an excuse to undermine the European budget. The Union must have more resources, its own resources, in particular to accompany the ecological transition towards a new, more sustainable development model. There is no future for a continent when too many young people are stuck in precariousness and unemployment. We need to invest in the future. We need a strong initiative for public investment and we have to rethink the dogma of austerity. After Brexit, a new-found awareness of the importance of the European Union is growing. We cannot disappoint our citizens again: they will not give us a second chance. We must deliver now, but we can do so only if we are looking forward – not looking to the past – and in a courageous and inclusive way.

This is the first time in this way we have exchanged views with the leading man of the Croatian executive on the challenges facing the European Union. Croatia has long been coy when it comes to European issues. I am extremely pleased that this government has changed that and that it is seeking to pursue a proactive policy at a European level. As an MEP, I can testify to very constructive cooperation with state institutions on many issues that are important for Croatia and the European Union, which was often not the case before. This government is finally thinking in European frameworks, but I'm afraid it has still failed to convince citizens of the importance of their participation in European policies. Accordingly, Croats are poorly taking advantage of the benefits of membership in the Union and this is a challenge we have to work on. Unfortunately, for most Croatian citizens, life has not changed for the better since 1 July 2013, so it is understandable that they do not consider membership in the Union a particularly success. Of all the members, Croatia is behind Croatia only Bulgaria, which is slowly catching up with a higher growth rate. In its Country Report, the IMF writes that the process of implementing structural reforms in Croatia has slowed down after joining the Union and that the investment climate is poor compared to comparable economies. In such circumstances, we should not be surprised that citizens do not show a greater interest in European policies, institutions and elections. That is why, Mr. President of the Croatian Government, I would like to encourage you to continue to change these unfavorable circumstances and not to stop in implementing reforms. It will sound a little incredible to many, but for the future of the European Union it is of great importance that countries such as Croatia are satisfied with it. States that have no imperialist ambitions, but their voice in the world can be boosted by membership of the Union. Countries that are not had a large and rich market, and by joining the Union they got exactly that. States whose citizens have felt dictatorship and authoritarian rule on their skin and in the Union still see freedom from repression and high democratic standards. If Croatia and its members sharing similar problems of the past and the challenges of the present in the Union do not see the added value and embodiment of their decades-long aspirations, then it has no future. If the European Union is a playground only for the great and powerful who will impose their will on the smaller and weaker, it will never fulfil all its potential. That is why, Mr. President of the Croatian Government, I hereby invite you to articulate at the Brussels table an authentic Croatian position that will not follow preset models and other people's ambitions.

I did campaign in Croatia in 2014 together with Nino Jakovčić, so I have seen in Istria in Croatia how all these new companies raise the growth that is there since the entry of Croatia into the European Union. I mostly visited wine estates with him, I have to tell you, but it is impressive what is happening economically in Croatia. I will pick and choose two points on the reform of the European Union. The first is on the new financial framework.  It is clear that it is a crucial thing and I ask one thing of the Council, to accept that in the future it cannot be as in the past. This Parliament will request a say on the expenditure and on the income. It has to be finished that this is the only parliament worldwide that has no say on the income of the European Union. That has to stop now. This is a full parliament and we will have a Multiannual Financial Framework in which both Council and Parliament, based on proposals from the Commission, will be responsible.  The second thing is the Spitzenkandidat. You were a Spitzenkandidat, Mr President, and I think you have said exactly what is at stake. The Spitzenkandidat is a gain in the democratic process and we cannot lose it. In my opinion, the best way not to lose it is to embed this system in a democratic process. Because Spitzenkandidaten where there is a backroom deal inside a political party or between political parties – I can tell you – people are not very involved in this. You need to involve the citizens. You need to give them the possibility to vote directly for a Spitzenkandidat, not only a Spitzenkandidat from their country, but the Spitzenkandidaten from other countries, so all Europeans have to have this possibility. Therefore, I think it is necessary to embed the Spitzenkandidaten in transnational lists, the first on the transnational list is the Spitzenkandidaten. That is the system and it gives the power to the citizens to vote for him. So there is no contradiction between both concepts. I think, Manfred, this Parliament has to unite between both concepts and if we do not do it, we risk losing everything in this fight and that we cannot afford in the European Union.  Finally, my third point on the Western Balkans. We are all in favour, my Group is in favour, of the entry of these countries under the conditions set by the Commission and, in that respect, I hope that Croatia can, again, with their Slovenian friends, give a good example, and find a fast—track solution for the border issue as fast as possible, based on the arbitrage that has been made.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Neoklis SYLIKIOTIS", "mepid": "124689", "text": "on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. — (GR) Mr President, Prime Minister, welcome to Parliament. Mr Juncker, ladies and gentlemen, no one can conceal the institutional, social and political crisis that the Union is experiencing. If the impoverishment of peoples, high unemployment - particularly among young people, lack of solidarity, large democratic deficits, xenophobia and racism could be concealed, we would not even have this debate today. We need an immediate change of direction from the policies of austerity and unbridled market freedom, from the policies of militarisation and lack of social solidarity. The austerity policies imposed on the peoples through the coordination of the economic policies of the Member States and the discipline of economic indicators at all costs are pushing the Member States into a continuous “dismantling” of the social state. The proposals put forward, for example on an economic suprise, will unfortunately lead to a deepening of anti-democratic and unpopular economic governance for the euro area and will perpetuate the widening of social inequalities in the European Union. The Commission's declarations so far on a social pillar of the European Union and on social justice have proved to be a smokescreen. The recent results of the discussions on the European Social Pillar, among the Heads of Member States of the Union in Göteborg, are a social 'placebo', as the European press has aptly described it. There is no legal commitment to the Member States and not a word about the human right to decent work. On the contrary, measures are being promoted towards further liberalisation and deregulation of industrial relations. In this neoliberal and antisocial context, xenophobic racist movements are exploiting the humanitarian crisis caused by neoliberal austerity policies through racist rhetoric. They are capitalising on the impoverishment of workers, the contraction of the social state, the continued reduction of wages, pensions and labour rights, and they are making new electoral victories by strengthening their strength. Refugee streams are treated with violence and inhumanity. Thousands of refugees are left to their fate, left to drown in the Mediterranean, while the Union raises new walls by creating a fortress Europe. At the same time, wars in our region are intensifying, the most recent example being Turkey's attack on the Afrin region in Syria. Ladies and gentlemen, in the face of this all-out attack on the peoples and workers, the positions of the GUE/NGL remain positions of principle. We call for the immediate lifting of neoliberal austerity policies. The peoples need public investment that will create decent new jobs with full workers' rights, through re-industrialisation and support for the real economy. Only such policies will strengthen the social state and allow social development. At the same time, we are calling for a common, human and permanent asylum system that guarantees human rights and human dignity. A system that will ensure legal and safe routes for refugees, humanitarian visas and strengthening family reunification, and equitably distribute the burdens of refugee flows. The new defence policy announced last summer to strengthen the defence industry serves only to strengthen NATO's operational capability and to participate in new interventions and warfare. The example of the Turkish invasion of Afrin, Syria against the Kurds, where the Turks fight and attack with German tanks and the Kurds defend themselves with German anti-tanks, is typical. This is where further militarisation and support for arms exports leads; new wars and new wars conflicts. Ladies and gentlemen, the neoliberal recipes of austerity, memoranda and the prevalence of the laws of the market and militarisation have been tested and failed. It is the policies that caused a humanitarian crisis. The future of Europe lies in social development, social justice and solidarity. It is in the further involvement of citizens, by strengthening the powers of the European Parliament, as well as by strengthening and expanding civil liberties. It is in peace and peaceful coexistence, both within and outside the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 11, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would like to welcome the Prime Minister to Parliament and to thank him very much for joining this debate about the future of Europe.

I hope that Croatia will do the same, and that especially you – as the leader of the country – will do your utmost to overcome the shadows of the past.  The future of Europe, as I see it, lies in creating the future of the people who live in Europe. This means enhancing their quality of life, improving social policies, and guaranteeing human rights. When I say human rights, I mean the rights of all humans. I am sad to see that, despite the economic improvements in Croatia that have already been mentioned, social inequality seems to be increasing rather than decreasing. This is a trend that we see in many European countries, and it is a trend that we urgently need to address. Refugee rights are human rights too, and I hope that you, Prime Minister, will not allow push—backs to happen in the future and that you will investigate the push—backs that have already happened from Croatia. Regarding women’s rights, it is 2018, and Croatia – together with other Member States – has unfortunately still not ratified the Istanbul Convention. How can it be that there is even a question about whether we should protect women from violence? How come this is still a debate? How come we are not moving on with this?  Finally, the future of all of us depends on how we treat our planet. Croatia is an example of a beautiful, resourceful country that can really show other European countries the way ahead. You said that you want to be on the energy map. I think Croatia has plenty of resources to be on the map of renewable energies and to be at the forefront. Therefore, I would urge you to reconsider your plans for those LNG terminals in the northern Adriatic, and also to reconsider some other huge development plans – like golf courses – because those would hurt not only the environment, but also local businesses. Be the example: show the way to do economy and ecology together. Europe can learn a lot from Croatia, but for that you need to be ambitious. The future of Europe is built by Europeans. It is what we make of it. I believe that civil society is a very important partner in this aim and needs to be supported. We should strive to end hate in Europe, to overcome nationalism and to strive together for a better and a common future. Your country, with its history and its geographical position, can be a prime example for all of that. The future can be bright, but only if we make it so.

This is clearly finally acknowledging that the present is not so good and it does not satisfy us. Problems with migrants, social exclusion, unemployment, many others, the more we discuss, the more these problems become clear, sometimes exacerbated. But only three hours once a month of such discussions in the European Parliament as the head of government of one country is, in my understanding, too little. The approach of the Head of Government of the twenty-seventh country of the European Union to the problems and the sharing of proposals with the European Parliament at the earliest spring of twenty years. Do we have so much time for discussions alone? And while it was mentioned that the Prime Minister's approach would be, it is still very interesting to hear what exactly Mr Prime Minister thinks about the creation of a European Security and Defence Union. I have understood that you are in favour of increasing the scope and effectiveness of defence costs. Or maybe it's better to invest in education, culture, social activities, science, sport? What about globalisation, Prime Minister, do you treat it positively or negatively? Should the European Union not defend small countries like your Croatia and my Lithuania? Could you present your concrete approach to the aspiration for Catalonia's independence? Would you see the position of the European Union as a gendarman of nations or would you advocate democratic processes? Do you support the introduction of a single European currency in all Community countries? It would be good if we were to think together about tackling demographic problems and promoting birth rate. How not languages, but real solutions to reduce youth unemployment? And the ball of problems caused by migration — what's the solution? Democracy problems should not be forgotten either. In the countries of the Community, it is necessary to hold referendums on the future of the European Union, at least on the direction of whether people are in favour of strengthening the union of autonomous states, while maintaining strong and sovereign national states? Do you want a new European federation without autonomous states?

I'm worried, as a dad before I was an Italian citizen. I feel someone says more immigrants have to be taken in. Croatia want to enter the euro and enter the Schengen system. Be careful! In Italy, over the last few years, 600 000 fake refugees have landed, not from the war but that the war brought us home. In one year, crimes carried out by foreign nationals were 250 000:55% theft, 51% exploitation of prostitution, 45% of extortion, 40% of rapes, i.e. 1 500 rapes in one year. What about Europe that does? Nothing, indeed recognizes the figure of the climatic immigrant, as if we don't have enough problems already. I felt the hypocrisy of the abuse of the words “democracy and human rights”, while in the past few hours the Turkish dictator Erdogan, dictator of that country whom someone would like to join the European Union, was welcomed with all honours in Rome. I remember that this country does not recognize the genocide of one and a half million Armenian citizens, the first holocaust in history, and therefore I am ashamed at the sole idea that such a dictator could quietly be greeted with all the honours in a country like mine and that someone thinks Turkey can enter Europe, unless there are series A deaths and series B deaths, and among the dead of series B the Armenians and maybe the Italians infoibed by communists and partisans titini forgotten by everything and everyone. We are bad on immigration and we are worse at work: 30 million unemployed in Europe, 3 million unemployed in Italy, 5 million poor people in Italy, 3 million workers exploited in black. And Europe, governed by the Juncker Commission, obviously helps the big ones and slaughters the little ones. What you could wait for different from someone who has been for almost twenty years in government of a tax haven like Luxembourg, which helped multinationals evade paying taxes where they had to pay them, slaughtering artisans, traders, professionals and small business owners. And then comes the banks directive, which helps German banks, comes the Bolkestein directive that helps multinationals. We're with the little ones, President. We would like to defend our agriculture, our rice, our oil, our milk, our wheat, our fish and our way of life. I heard the group leader Weber, who gave a good speech. There are more homelands, there are more peoples, there are more feelings of belonging. The problem is not populism, nationalism, xenophobia and racism. The number one problem right now is Islamic terrorism and unemployment that is leading peoples to fight back. Someone is afraid of elections. Someone fears the election. Someone fears elections and the vote of Italians. It means you have a problem. If you are afraid of the free vote of citizens, it means that this EU is the Titanic that is sinking. We will put it all: Either Europe changes or the peoples will change it, starting from 4 March in Italy. For someone comes first the bankers, multinationals and immigrants, for me and the League come first the Italians.

Speaking of the future of Europe, the main question is: should we continue on the Lisbon road, towards increasingly robust integration, or do we need cooperation to keep Member States' autonomy better? The answer must be made in the light of Brexit. Syed Kamall, Head of the European Parliament for British Conservatives, said that the departure of a Member State must lead everyone to a deep reflection on the state of the European Union. Excessive centralisation of powers for the benefit of the institutions is a problem, the citizens of the Member States do not feel the European Union as their own. In recent years, referendums and elections have shown that the peoples of Europe reject the model of a federal state. The Union should respect its Member States and become a community of cooperative nations. On the other hand, Martin Schulz said that the United States of Europe must be created by 2025, and those countries who do not want this should quit. A few words about who are pro-Europeans? Those who are on the Lisbon road are giving themselves the right to be pro-European, who are otherwise anti-European. A deterrent example of this was given by Manfred Weber in his current speech. Those who want more autonomy in the Member States have classified them as dangerous nationalists and summarised our perception in the following statement: we say hell with Europe. How dare you accuse us of this because we're on a different path?

Several points on several questions and comments. First, on Jean-Claude’s comment on balancing the enthusiasm, ambition and the financial realism of what we would like to see implemented, what policies should be the guiding lines of our project and which budgetary means we have available. The fact that the UK is leaving is – as I know thanks to my earlier position as a Member of the Committee on Budgets here – not a positive thing. It is a downside. Let’s be very clear about it: we have a downside. We all know that more or less 10 Member States finance around 80% of our budget. This is something we don’t widely publicise, but these are the facts, and the catch in the negotiations on the next Multiannual Financial Framework will be how to fill in the void which will be there. Can we have enough resources to implement all the objectives of our policies? Will this require more contributions from all Member States? Are some countries willing to increase it or to remain in the framework of what they are paying or contributing today? The situation is not the same if you are looking at it from the optics of the countries which contribute with a substantial percentage, or coming from a country with more modest economic and financial abilities where the increase would not be so dramatic. So after the analysis which we have made in Croatia if there were an increased demand from our side we would be willing to do it, to be very clear at the beginning. When it comes to issues of enlargement, something that several of you have mentioned, if ever there was a policy or a dossier that we know more than well it is enlargement. It is a very positive coincidence for me that the Commission will come up with a paper during the college a few hours later, bringing forward, as you said, the indicative timeline for the countries that remain within the group that we called the Western Balkans. They are divided into three groups. Serbia and Montenegro as the countries that negotiate, Albania, our friends in Macedonia – who are now negotiating the issue of the name with Greece more intensively, and from what I understand, with a bit more optimism on finding a solution as the second group – and then Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Kosovo, as the final two. My country has no dilemma. First of all, we are helping all of them already. You are not aware of that, but so many Croatian experts are engaged in one way or another, transferring the freshest knowledge on the process of accession negotiations to all of our neighbours. We also know that, as Jean-Claude has said, the bilateral issues should not obstruct or slow down the process of any country’s accession to the EU. We know it better than you, if I may be very clear. Having spent basically my entire life dedicated to the objective that one day my country would be around this table, I know what it means to lose a couple of years in the accession process. In my modest assessment around five years were lost, due to two main reasons. One relating to the bilateral issues, and the other to wider international conditionalities. Five years from a historical perspective might not seem a lot, but it is an awful lot when you consider what it means to invest or lose in your economic, social development and take the benefits of EU membership. This is something I know well. That is why I see the role of my country as a bridge, as a facilitator and as someone who will advocate further enlargement. There is no dilemma for us: we want to follow up on what the Bulgarian Presidency is doing in Sofia in May and that is the EU-Western Balkans summit after 15 years when it was last held in Thessaloniki. The first one was held in Zagreb. I was one of the organisers of it. My ambition is to have one in 2020, twenty years later, and we are trying to give a push because having the future of our neighbours anchored in the EU is positive for Croatia. It will help us to address all the residual and open issues which stem from the times when Croatia, as I said at the beginning, was a victim of aggression. That’s why we will do our utmost to help all of our neighbours, especially Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here we all have a historical responsibility, and that is why I mentioned it at the beginning, to safeguard the full equality of all the three constituent peoples and all other groups in the country. When it comes to the issue of Slovenia, which you have raised, Slovenia is a friend of Croatia. It is the only country in our history, over many centuries, with which we have never had any conflict, which is rare in our part of the world, almost an exception. This is not perhaps the best forum or the place to go into details of our border issue, but what I would like to stress here is my government’s readiness and openness to solve this issue in a manner which would be acceptable for both countries, taking into account the interests of both Slovenia and Croatia. That is what I proposed to Miro Cerar about a month and a half ago, because at this a moment we have a good opportunity to do it. At the same time, those of you who are following this in a little more detail will know that Croatia’s Parliament has withdrawn from the arbitration process that was facilitated by the EU in 2009 in order to unblock 14 chapters of the accession negotiations at a time stalled by Slovenia because of the fact that it was unfortunately the Slovenian representatives who violated the arbitration rules and violated in international law. We were there in good faith and we were investing all our efforts in this. So what we need to do now is find a compromise where both Slovenia and Croatia can be happy. I am willing to do that. I have the courage to do it, but the only thing I cannot do is close my eyes and say ‘no, everything was okay’. This is something I cannot do. But what I can do is to refrain from any unilateral actions, refrain from making this state-to-state problem into a citizens’ problem. This is what I can do, and some of you know what I mean, and that includes fishermen. Because I do not think that is smart and that is useful. On the contrary, it can create an environment where it will be more difficult to achieve an agreement. So from my point of view, with a bit of patience, with a bit of a sense and sensibility we can make progress, while refraining from unilateral actions, because even if arbitration was to be considered under international law both countries have to agree for it be implemented. Things are relatively clear to all of those who know a bit more detail. I will do everything in my power to eliminate tensions and ensure that a solution is found. At the same time, let me be very honest and clear with all of you. There are so many other still open bilateral issues among many Member States and they never arrive on the table of the European Council, or the European Parliament. This is something we should remember. A few points on the social elements that you mentioned. On the social elements it was a very timely initiative that we had in Goteborg, initiated by Sweden. The social pillar principles, 20 of them, are items that we can all improve on a national level. I am in favour of social dialogue with our social partners, both at European and national level. We have taken account of the fact that minimum wages and the average salary have increased, and that major tax reform which we have undertaken at national level has had an overall positive impact on our citizens, including on the demographic issue by leaving more money to mothers and fathers, by via some additional allowances for those with children and larger families. These include subsidising interest rates on the housing loans and a number of other measures that we have taken in order to address the most critical issue, a structural issue affecting my society at least, and that is the question of demographic revitalisation. A few points on the Spitzenkandidaten and transnational lists. In the last elections in 2014 I was privileged to be on the list of the Croatian EPP family and I was always mentioning Jean-Claude at every single event we had – and he was more popular than he can imagine! But it took us a lot of effort to communicate to Croatian voters who Jean-Claude was. It wasn’t always easy, it took me a lot of effort, as Dubravka and Ruža and the others know, so my point is that we have to be realistic. We have different budgets for campaigning, we have different legislative frameworks for campaigns. We have an issue of accountability to our constituency. I am very much, as you can see, a pro-European leader of the Croatian Government, but I need to see that it is the right time and that there is sufficient preparedness. We need to look at things from all aspects. So I advocate the Spitzenkandidaten, absolutely. Are we ready for transnational lists, will they be adequately and fairly represented everywhere across the 27? For that I would need to see a little more concrete evidence that it is feasible. This is what I think from the experiences I have had personally so far and the consultations with my friends. A few points on the issues of climate change, renewable energy, and the protection of nature. You are right. We are lucky to have such a place in Europe, with all the benefits of being on the Adriatic and the Danube, being a country which is really rich in water and natural resources, but we are also aware of our energy needs. So we are looking at the ecological aspects of every single project in a very detailed manner in dialogue with local communities and in dialogue with the NGOs looking at various projects and various items. On the Istanbul Convention, which you have mentioned, few people know that Croat experts initiated the whole exercise within the Council of Europe just next door here. Here we signed it in 2013. I don’t know why the Social Democratic government at the time didn’t pass to the step of ratification. It remains a mystery to me because they had two years. What I have done is ensure we have completed the public consultation. The process of preparing the legislation to forward to Parliament is almost over. Unfortunately, the debate on this Convention which was there, in my view, to protect and prevent violence in the family – especially violence against women – has somehow acquired a different dimension in many public debates, a sort of gender ideology debate which is trying to put a different angle on the substance. I am willing to debate this within the Croatian Parliament, within the political parties and with the public, and try to distinguish the wood from the trees. This is my task ahead in the months which will follow. Finally, an issue of identity, which was rightly mentioned by Manfred, thank you very much. We have always longed to be part of this European project. It was on the lips of most of the Croats ever since we became independent in 1990. And therefore the national identity which we acquired, in terms of international recognition and finally having our own state after nine centuries, is very strong. We will nurture it and respect it Ruža, as you know. But at the same time, trying to build this European project from the perspective of a country that is aware of what war means – and luckily most of your generations in your Member States are not aware of this – gives me another argument that this very project should be strengthened by all means, and by consensus if possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 16, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Francis ZAMMIT DIMECH", "mepid": "188906", "text": " — Sur President, huwa ta' unur u pjair li niddiscustu, fil-preżenza tal-prim Ministru tal-kroazja, it-theme tal-futur tal-ewropa.

Alone, Britain cannot face the common challenges of climate change, mass migration or international terrorism, for example. The UK’s decision now to leave the single market and customs union will also weaken both parties, and poses big problems at the Irish border.  I also hope that the UK can stay plugged into security and defence structures by cooperating closely with PESCO, and as rapporteur of the Parliament for Montenegro, I also hope that the UK can stay engaged in joint projects in the Western Balkans.

First of all, on the issue of defence, which Charles Tannock mentioned, I believe that strengthening European defence is very important, given the wider context of the challenges we have when it comes to security. Having seen what we have discussed over the past couple of years, one of the first things I did as Prime Minister was to put through the new national security strategy, a new system of homeland security, and to increase our defence budget. We are in the process of acquiring new jet fighters. I want to be a credible country with capabilities that can increase and be inter-operational with other allies within NATO and with partners in the European Union. That is why we are participating, with almost 450 Croatian military personnel, in various operations across the world, be it with the UN, NATO or the European Union. On the UK’s exit, I think the critical thing is to find what type of future contractual relationship we will forge between the United Kingdom and the EU. I think it was Walter Hallstein who said that association can be membership minus one percent, or cooperation plus one percent: that is a very large span for what we can put into the new contractual relationship. This is a choice. It is a political choice, in a strange situation, when someone is actually about to leave. In my view, that will be critical in the next phase of the negotiations with London. Regarding the Spitzenkandidat and transnational lists, I have a practical concern. The budget in my country currently for the whole list for the campaign is EUR 200 000. If a colleague wants to campaign he has EUR 200 000 for the whole length of the campaign. As a candidate, how do you think he will campaign in Turku, in Braga, in Palermo or somewhere on the shores of Bourgas in Bulgaria? He cannot do it. This is the problem. We should invest a little bit more practical thinking in this: probably increasing the limits of financing, finding ways to ensure that the new system not only underpins the person who is a candidate for the future presidency of the European Commission but also gives equal opportunities to someone from what I would call a ‘notorious’ political family or someone from a big country with a strong media presence, or someone from a smaller country. This is my concern and I do not see the answer in the debate so far. As I said, we need to have equal chances in this exercise. In my view, the way it is now being contemplated is not entirely fair. That is why I have very clear reservations at this stage. I am not saying we will not find a solution. When it comes to the Multiannual Financial Framework, you mentioned that I said we needed to find smart approaches. The smartest way is to know what you want, what your political priorities are, and then attach the financial means to those priorities. For a couple of years, I have been following the work of the group of experts led by Mr Monti – so often eloquently represented by Alain Lamassoure – on the reform of the own resources system. This is absolutely key if we want to avoid the debates that Mr Verhofstadt mentioned when we asked if it is the Council which decides on income and Parliament which decides on expenditure. This is essential. We always debate in the nitty-gritty negotiations and trilogues in a short time in order to achieve a political goal. Therefore, finding a balance between research, innovation, the digital economy, youth, jobs, and traditional policy areas, such as regional policy development or agriculture or defence, is always a challenge. I believe that if we understand what the challenges will be in the next decade we can find consensus, especially now when – after the 2016 blues, after the Brexit referendum and with the political developments in 2017, especially the enthusiastic approach of President Macron of France, and the likely formation of another German Government led by Chancellor Merkel – we have gone, in football terms, from a 0-1 to a 2-1 situation.

Yes, Croatia wants the European Union to go in the direction of strengthening defence cooperation. If there is one area since 1993-99 that has evolved rapidly, it is certainly that one and, as I already said at the beginning, our commitment is strong and it is clear. The way we are building our own capabilities is in the direction that we are not there in a declaratory manner but in an operational manner. So from that point of view, a plus. When it comes to the Schengen entry-exit system, you know that we got the envelope when we were negotiating our accession of EUR 120 million to increase the capacities of the Croatian police, of the Croatian border system to surveil our borders and it is perhaps the best absorption of all the funds that we have. We have so far, at the level of contractual arrangements, about 50% above the total allocation for Croatia, which is just over EUR 10.3 billion. We have more or less contracted EUR 5.2 billion. When it comes to Schengen we have actually absorbed 98%. Given the migratory refugee crisis a few years ago we were the country that today looks at this issue in a way that our focus should be on protecting the external borders of the European Union, on preventing further migratory flows at the source of the crisis – failing states, wars, conflicts, poverty and other reasons why people are looking towards Europe from the continents which are around us. The entry-exit system, yes. Preparation for Schengen, whether it is formally within the mandate of this Parliament, I would be very happy if we could achieve that. We will try to do the maximum but you know it is a decision both of the Council and needing the support of the European Parliament. We didn’t opt for barbed wire on our borders but we are protecting our borders with our forces and strengthening our capacities if and where there is a need. When it comes to the issue of minorities, which was mentioned earlier by one of the colleagues, perhaps you don’t know, but the Croatian Parliament has a fixed quota for eight members of parliament from minorities – three from the Serbian minority, and today we also have representatives of an Italian minority. We have a representative of the Hungarians, of the Czechs, and of the Roma as well, which is very important because this was mentioned in one of the debates earlier where there was an insinuation that we do not protect the Roma minority enough. On the contrary, we have a special operational programme for minorities where we have invested a lot and one Albanian minority lady representative. Why am I saying this? All eight of those minorities are members of my parliamentary majority, which I personally wanted to be like that because I feel that the minorities in any European country, and especially in Croatia with all the historical legacies that we have, can better cater for their needs, their priorities and their position in our society if they are within the majority and influencing the policies of our country. That is why this is a very dear subject for me from a principle point of view, with all the European values always in mind. When it comes to the three questions of my colleague Nino Jakovčić: on subsidiarity, absolutely yes. You are aware that my ambition is to involve – first of all when it comes to the European national level and the multi-layered governance – the Croatian parliament more than before. That is why I am there every single time after I come back from the European Council. I spend hours trying to promote the substance of the European dossiers to the Croatian MPs and to the Croatian public. No one has ever thought of doing this before and not even deliberated it. This is an idea that I want, where the national parliaments have a role to play in our legislative pipeline, more than today. Second, on Uljanik and on the shipping industry and the shipyards in Croatia. In our accession process if there was one critical issue on the agenda it was in Chapter 8, it was competition, state aid, how to help the shipyards in distress. It actually cost a lot of money in the Croatian budget. Some of them are stable, restructured and ordering new ships. Some of them occasionally have difficulties in the market which has globally completely altered to what it was before. You know it and I know it. The decision on Uljanik was a political choice, as we were convinced that this shipyard in Pula – which is also the co-owner of a shipyard in Rijeka, the 3. Maj, and which employs together more than 5 000 people – has the potential to find a strategic partner, restructure and have long-term viability of production. This is why we believed it was a good choice, and that is why we explained to the European Commission to give us a go-ahead in this decision. On the visit of President Vučić, I don’t see that much mystification as is flowing around in the media. I see President Vučić almost every two months in various international fora. There are items on the agenda which should be addressed – the question of missing persons, border issues, war damages if you like, the laws which Serbia has passed in order to increase its jurisdiction when it comes to the prosecution of war crimes beyond its own territories... We have debated this in this House. I don’t want to enter into that. But there is goodwill on the Croatian side to sit down and try to understand how we can surmount the obstacles. This is the object. The normalisation agreement between the two countries dates from 1996. There are always political connotations when different personalities are involved, and this visit therefore has an extra careful element in the whole process of its preparation. On the arbitration and Slovenia, dear colleague Šoltes, you can present it the way you said: yes, everything was perfect, a textbook case, fantastic behaviour, never better, and we should definitely try to copy the process for all the other open border issues. I, unfortunately, cannot agree with that, and you know it. I am even hesitating to be as explicit as I perhaps should in this forum, but I will repeat to you again, let’s refrain from unilateral action. Let’s find a way for both Slovenia and Croatia to find a commonly acceptable fair and reasonable solution to the border issue. In my view it is an overblown topic both politically and in the media. Nothing dramatic has happened to any of our citizens. But that will happen if one of the countries chooses the path of unilateral actions and fines. This is something I really regret and it was not the choice of my country. The goodwill is there. I know that the Prime Minister Cerar and the entire Slovenian Government have taken some positions – there are elections very soon in Slovenia – but despite that, we are open for dialogue and also, if you like, some good ideas from our friends that might help us in that direction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 34, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Henna VIRKKUNEN", "mepid": "124726", "text": " — Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister for a very good speech.

The position of Croatia is very clear and you know it very well. Whether we qualify something as a small abuse or a failure, as if skiing is at stake or are we going to say that this is a violation of international law, it is now up to the assessment of you or us, in terms of the Slovenian or Croatian side of what was in the arbitration process. What you also know, and we know, is that Croatia made the decision of the Croatian Parliament at the time I was in this forum, not in that convention of the Croatian Parliament and that it is unanimous and firm. That's why I said that this moment, when we have an arbitration judgment that you want to implement, and we don't acknowledge it, we need to find a political and legal way to reconcile those views and use the opportunity to resolve the border issue. What I also very clearly mean is that people who are neither Slovenes nor Croats understand, that this issue is being de-dramatized: it is not a question on which the fate of either Slovenia or Croatia depends. And that's why it was even strange for me to hear rhetoric about Slovenian laws that would take care of those Slovenes who stayed on the unhappy side of the border. I prefer to talk about Slovenia as a country that had the slogan Sunny side of the Alps. I don't see in that point. The point is that we are close, that we are friends, that we go skiing, and you come to the sea and I want it to stay that way. I do not want one problem, interstate, to be transferred to the level of concrete, ordinary people, and in this particular case, especially fishermen. And that's why I underline that we are open to both dialogue and agreement and to the solution of the issue, but that issue is not as dramatic as it seeks to portray it. This is what we managed in Croatia, for the first time in the last 25 years that we have not had any great drama in the Croatian public on this issue. It It hasn't happened to us yet, and you know what it's been like in the past years. Basically, we are here to solve the problem, but try to understand the realities of both political and legal, and factual, after all, that have happened. As far as these other topics are concerned, the issue of the rule of law which is trying to contextualize a little in this context is of course crucial and important for Croatia. This initiative was ultimately the fruit of the previous convention of the Parliament, the European Parliament and the previous Commission, and in some ways we continued it at this time. It is essential that, at national level and in dialogue, first of all with the European Commission, ways are found to address issues that we have different views and therefore believe that the mechanisms of dialogue available to us, in accordance with the contract, can lead to a solution. As for Bulgaria and Romania in Schengen, I already said in my opening speech that I support it, that I think it would be useful and good. You have this mechanism of cooperation and verification since 2007, when you became a member. Those of us who became later don't have it. We felt at that point that it was good not to have one because we have met the criteria for so long that we were convinced that such some kind of post-accession monitoring was not necessary for us and that we could find other ways to comply with our obligations and look at it so. And that is why I believe that your success according to Schengen would be our success, and we will fulfill the criteria as far as technical criteria, border control and guarantee the tightness of the external border of Croatia. Issues of populism and Euroscepticism, yes, exactly, I am very clear, and this is what I am saying in Croatia, a lawyer advocating for the political mainstream because it brings stability, predictability; continues on the basis of this European project built by our founding fathers and many politicians and parties and statesmen and parliamentarians who have built it for the last nearly seventy years. What we are witnessing, we are witnessing at the European level and at the level of all our debate, that many in today's digital communication space use all these means to market their ideas. Sometimes these ideas are not always supported by accurate and reliable information. I think for the future of our democratic debate, in general democratic processes, we must strive very well to distinguish between what is accurate and true and what is not. Here I see the key to a future democratic debate that will answer the issue of populism at the level of member states, which, as we know, is also reflected in European elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 43, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Elmar BROK", "mepid": "1263", "text": " Mr President!

I see that voting time is approaching, so the plenary is filling up a little more than in the hours before, but that is absolutely normal and to be expected. First of all, let me conclude with some general remarks. Your initiative of holding a debate here in plenary in Strasbourg with the prime ministers or heads of state or government of the EU Member States on the future of Europe is really useful and timely, and it will contribute to the strategic decisions which are ahead of us. I feel enriched by your comments. I feel more up to date in terms of the direction that the political parties in the European Parliament are taking. That is very important for me, because, being fully occupied at national level, sometimes we do not fully grasp the trends at European level. There were several comments in the last round of questions, one of them on the cohesion policy and implementing measures, which Ivana has just mentioned. I think that for Croatia, which is undergoing a first seven-year multiannual financial framework, the experience is critical with a view to improvement for the next seven years. And you have been working on this issue as closely as anyone here in this forum, Ivana. What I would like to see is swifter absorption, clearer competences, a procedure that is transparent and efficient, and that finally EU financing is more visible, clearer and more recognisable for Croatian citizens. Therefore, we shall urge, at European level and at national level, the adoption of the new legislative mechanisms that are tending in that direction. The comments made by Alojz are basically along the same lines as those of all the Slovenian colleagues. I think I have addressed this issue adequately. My message is clear. The open issues which exist among Member States should be resolved by negotiations, and by using various instruments of international dispute settlement, notably peaceful ones. We believe that these processes should be credible and clean, and that is the only way for the results to be accepted and implemented. This is the key message. Croatia has no ambition to stall or make more difficult our neighbours’ path to the EU. On the contrary, we have been very much a bridge, an influencing country that has unselfishly offered all the experience which is most recent, and thus most relevant for their path to the European Union – trying to address the questions that were mentioned by some of the Members. I am also grateful that the only MEP still serving from the first directly elected Parliament, my friend Elmar, took the floor and mentioned the concept of equality and the representation in this House. I think that the right balance needs to be struck. It is not as easy for those national delegations which are less numerous to cover all the work of such big and important institutions. I know for a fact that smaller and bigger countries sometimes lose sight of one another’s viewpoints because we do not really understand the other’s concerns. The Croatian Government that I head is, as you know, a reformist government, a government which will do its utmost to make my country part of the inner circle – Schengen, the eurozone and various other forms of enhanced cooperation – and to strengthen our own internal institutions and our European credibility and responsibility. In that respect, dialogue with the European Parliament will be something that we will take into account and take on board when preparing our presidency of the Council, which is envisaged for the first semester of 2020. I thank you all very much for this opportunity. It has been a pleasure to be back with you in Strasbourg. I think that, in this parliamentary term, the European Parliament has done a lot in terms of important and relevant legislative acts of the European Union with long-term consequences.

According to the World Health Organisation, around two hundred million women and girls are currently experiencing the consequences of female genital mutilation worldwide, and the European Institute for Gender Equality reports women and girls affected by this mutilation in at least thirteen European countries. Member States of the Union. Thus, female genital mutilation, along with other forms of gender-based violence, is a way of controlling the female body and violates women's right to health, safety, integrity of the body and, in some cases, even the right to life. Criminal law of all Member States of the European Union provides, directly or indirectly, for the protection of girls and women against female genital mutilation, but we in the European Parliament are particularly concerned that it seems ineffective because only a few cases. This can be and for many reasons. It is therefore very important that we remove obstacles to the rights of the Member States to bring cases of female genital mutilation, taking into account, first of all, the interests of the child, because this shameful procedure is carried out by girls before they reach adulthood. Of course, prevention would be a much more effective and more desirable way to combat this phenomenon. Unfortunately, this is not always possible. Therefore, we must also ensure that prosecution can take place, that it serves as a deterrence and at least protects future victims. Speaking about prevention, it should be noted that female genital mutilation is one of the most predictable forms of gender-based violence. Therefore, I would like to call on the Commission and the Member States to ensure decisive preventive action for refugees camps. I also urge and respect the Commission to continue to include prevention of female genital mutilation and other harmful practices in integration procedures and the Asylum Migration Integration Fund and to provide important information through the EU Asylum Agency. Another preventive measure would be the setting of the highest level of protection for an asylum seeker when asylum is requested for reasons related to female genital mutilation, of course in the context of the reform of the European asylum system and the revision of the asylum directives. Stakeholders seeking to eliminate this practice take the view that cross-sectoral cooperation should be strengthened and that the problem of female genital mutilation is included in all sectors: health, social work, asylum, education, law enforcement, justice, child protection, media and communication, because the ongoing female genital mutilation or danger has a multifaceted impact on the lives of girls and women. In all these sectors, measures must be put in place to provide adequate protection and services to the affected women, girls or potential victims. Another fifteen years later, the Commission informed Parliament about its actions to eliminate female genital mutilation. However, today, once again, I ask the Commission to provide an overview of the progress made and of the actions taken until now. What has the Commission done to include the prevention of female genital mutilation in all the relevant policy and legislative programmes of the various Directorates-General to ensure that this issue is addressed in all these sectors? What further steps are being taken on integrated policy measures and what cooperation mechanisms are being implemented? In addition, how will the Commission integrate its efforts and coordinate Member States' actions to combat female genital mutilation through a broader programme to combat gender-based violence under the Istanbul Convention? And how will the issue of female genital mutilation be addressed through the newly launched EU-United Nations flagship initiative on the elimination of violence against women and girls?

I remember our past discussions on this subject, and I am happy that the European Parliament is shedding light again on this evil practice.  I want to say a few words about statistics, but whenever we start speaking about figures, we forget that we are speaking about real people and real tragedies of women and children, women and girls. So let me share two stories with you. Last year, I met Ms Assiatou Diallo. She is now 49. She underwent FGM when she was 3 years old. Now, she is the mother of two teenage girls aged 16 and 18. She arrived in Belgium from Guinea 10 years ago: she escaped in order to save her girls from undergoing female genital mutilation.  I wish you could all meet her. Her life has not been easy. But she is active in the Groupe pour l’Abolition des mutilations sexuelles féminines, a Belgian NGO, and she speaks loudly about the need to stop the practice. I have also read the story of Jaha Dukureh, who is 24. As an infant growing up in Gambia, she experienced female genital mutilation. As she describes, it took away a part of her femininity, her ownership of her body. Some girls, including her half-sister, who died from complications resulting from being cut, even lose their lives.  We must keep in mind these real stories of real women and girls. We must think about them. We must work for them and we must fight those who are committing this horrible crime. Neither custom, tradition, culture, privacy, religion nor so-called honour can justify violence. Let me come back to statistics. Estimates show that at least half a million of the girls and women who have suffered female genital mutilation live in Europe in 13 EU Member States. The Commission has been active in working towards prevention, as well as ensuring adequate support for victims since 2013, mainstreaming the importance of preventing and eradicating female genital mutilation, and actively contributing to several services.  We believe that it is important to work on different areas at the same time and to tackle the issue from different angles and across the portfolios. This is why the communication is an Action Plan built around five priority areas: the first is improving knowledge and data; the second, supporting sustainable social change; the third, priority protection; the fourth, prosecution; and the fifth priority is combating FGM worldwide.  Within our rights, equality and citizenship programme we have issued a specific call on projects relating to female genital mutilation and other harmful practices. The last call, worth EUR 9.7 million, closed in November 2017, and a new call, worth EUR 10.6 million, will open on 8 March this year. Moreover, the European Institute for Gender Equality has developed a common methodology and indicators to estimate the risk of FGM. Under the heading of development policy outreach outside the EU we are one of the main contributors to the United Nations Joint Programme on the Abandonment of FGM. Through the programme, to which the EU contributes EUR 11 million, more than 1.5 million girls and women have received mutilation-related protection and care services. In addition, since 2016 the EU has supported seven projects implemented by civil society organisations in third countries to put an end to this practice. The ‘Spotlight Initiative’ intends to target specific issues and prevalent forms of gender-based violence in different global regions, in a comprehensive manner and on the basis of evidence. In Africa, for example, the priority is to eliminate female genital mutilation.  The role of the Commission also consists of disseminating training materials for legal practitioners through the European e-Justice portal. One thing must be emphasised here. FGM is a crime in all EU Member States. Its criminalisation is also required under the Istanbul Convention, and its victims therefore also fall within the scope of the Convention’s prevention, support and protection measures in those Member States that have ratified the Convention. So far, there have been 17 within the EU. All the others, which have started the process of accession through signing, are now assessing their legal frameworks. The way to ratification is not always easy, and recently we have seen very worrying signals in several Member States whereby the issues of ideology and religion have been brought into the discussion. But the Convention is clearly about protecting girls and women from violence based on the fact that they are women, nothing else, and nothing less.  The efforts to combat FGM and support its victims are integrated into EU legislation, notably the Victims’ Rights Directive. The reform of the Common European Asylum System put forward by the Commission in 2016 aims to reinforce the protection safeguards available to persons with special needs seeking asylum in Europe. Relevant provisions of the Reception Conditions Directive stipulate that victims should receive the necessary medical and psychological treatment, and staff working with them should have appropriate training. Female genital mutilation has to stop in Europe. It is a crime in all Member States, but girls continue to be cut. The legal framework is important, but it is not enough, unfortunately. The research by the European Institute for Gender Equality for the new study to be published in May clearly shows that in order for the rules to work, the police and the courts must enforce them and prosecute those responsible for crimes. Training for people implementing the law is vital, combined with raising awareness of the legislation amongst the communities involved. We must work together with all stakeholders at all levels, from our political dialogues with national administrations to our support for doctors, religious leaders and parents determined to eradicate female genital mutilation once and for all.

Let’s join forces and say loud and clear: ‘my issue too. For everyone, everywhere’. FGM is a harmful practice that can have serious consequences, including physical and psychological damage on girls. We are talking about little girls as young as four to eight years old. And no culture, no tradition can justify this terrible violence. As co-rapporteur on the Istanbul Convention, as you mentioned Madam Commissioner, we call once again on all Member States to ratify and enforce the Convention fully. It criminalises FGM. It provides strict sanctions and medical and psychological support for victims. Member States must do more faster and better to combat impunity, bring perpetrators to justice, work on prevention, identify girls at risk at an early stage, provide access to health care and reproductive services and train professionals. Member States should also fully implement the Directive on protection of victims and consider, as you said, FGM in the asylum process. The victims should be considered vulnerable groups. Madam Commissioner, I fully support the EU commitment to step up cooperation with third countries, providing technical assistance to encourage the adoption of laws banning FGM, and ensuring that these laws are fully enforced. But no sustainable change can happen without involving the local communities, and we need to work hand in hand with civil society at grass-root level to empower girls to speak up and to change behaviour, to promote changed behaviour, including in refugee camps, as was said here, for girls on the move.

Both clitoridectomy, the most prevalent form of excision, and other treatments of this type are classified from the point of view of medicine as severe bodily harm endangering not only the health but also the lives of women due to serious physical and mental complications. In Europe, these practices are punishable, but for now without consequences for people coming from non-European countries. It seems necessary that both the European Parliament and other institutions influence countries where the procedure is permissible and counteract it by eliminating it entirely from legal order and social practice.

Beyond education by means of all forms of transmission and the possibility of prevention, attention should be paid to the health consequences and suffering of women being crippled throughout their lives and human rights abuses.

There is no place for such a practice in a civilised society. Today is the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM). However, it is important to remember that we have to fight this human rights violation every single day of the year. This is not just happening outside our continent. This is a practice – as we heard from our colleagues here in the House – also inside the EU, probably in most of our Member States. I want Member States to mainstream the prevention of FGM into all sectors: health, social work, asylum, education, child protection and media. Cross—sectoral cooperation is the key to fighting this inhuman practice. This cooperation will serve to disseminate acquired knowledge and foster an enabling environment for collective social change and, above all, it will contribute to an improvement in the well—being of young women and girls where FGM is practised. Actions speak louder than words. We have a shared responsibility to fight this practice, and I thank the Commissioner for presenting to us the concrete measures taken in order to mainstream FGM prevention. The Istanbul Convention is the first treaty to recognise that FGM exists in Europe and that it needs to be systematically addressed. Therefore, I urge the Member States which have still not ratified the Istanbul Convention finally to do so. I call on the Bulgarian Presidency to accelerate the process on their side, because it is their issue too. It is highly important that the EU cooperates in this matter and finds a unified approach to fighting violence against women and to fighting female genital mutilation.

We are very united in this House, Commissioner, that we need to do more to combat FGM, both in our home countries and globally.

A patriarchal attack on women's bodies and sexuality, just like so much other violence, just like other attacks on our bodies. In that sense, working against FGM is, for me, part of the feminist sisterhood; the struggle for our bodies, our right to decide over them, the right to our sexuality. And in this sense, FGM should be part of a comprehensive strategy to combat violence against women and girls. A strategy we are still waiting for, Commissioner. What we also need to do to be successful is to learn from the organisations and actors who have worked in different countries for decades with very little means to combat FGM, and that is often in other parts of the world. We must also demand, as some colleagues have said, that women and girls who are exposed or at risk of FGM receive asylum here with us. And last, but perhaps greatest of all: provide more support to women's organizations that work tirelessly, but by far too little means. What we don't need, colleagues — we'll probably hear it from far-right actors later here — what we don't need is for racists around Europe to instrumentalize some form of violence against women to whip up more of their racist or anti-refugee policies.

Our duty is to do everything we can to stop this threat to our young European girls. Rarely, you admit in your resolution that these barbaric practices are carried out by civilizations and immigrant populations. All right, but what are you proposing to fix it? A reform of the Union's immigration procedures to make maiming an automatic ground for asylum.

It will not offer the women victims you think you are defending with this text solutions, quite the contrary. You offer them cruelly new hope knowing full well that it is only illusory.

Commissioner! Dear ladies! Three million girls are drastically mutilated every year. The procedure for genital mutilation is already performed on several or dozen years old girls, often during the first menstruation. The procedure involves the excision of the clitoris, in drastic cases also the smaller labia and the larger part of the labia. This operation is performed, often in hygiene conditions, in many countries in Africa and Asia, but also in Europe, in immigrant environments from these areas. It is estimated that in 2016 there were two hundred million women who were mutilated in this way. In cultures where these cruel customs apply, the procedure is intended to introduce the girl into the world of adulthood, integrate into the community, make her pure and faithful to her future husband. In fact, it's torture, the source of infections, serious illnesses, neuroses and even the death of girls and women. Attempts to crack down on the phenomenon in Africa and Asia through legal bans have so far failed to produce satisfying results. Also in the European Union, where five hundred thousand mutilated women live, and where in every member country we have criminal laws to prosecute the perpetrators of these cruel acts, there have been only a few criminal trials.

FGM is a totally unacceptable practice, and in order to bring it to an end we must understand the complexity of the phenomenon. FGM is a part of a continuum of violence against women. It’s an extreme manifestation of patriarchy but it is not the only one. In order to eradicate FGM, it is important to view it as a form of violence against women and girls, and as one of the multiple avatars of society’s policing of women’s bodies and sexuality. FGM must also be understood as a cultural practice often viewed as beneficial for the victim. FGM is more common in families where the parents’ background includes a low level of education, and this demonstrates the importance of empowering women, not only when it comes to sexual and reproductive health but also from an economic, political and educational perspective. Involvement in political and social processes is always beneficial but it holds particular relevance when it comes to ending all forms of violence against women and girls. Lastly, we must bear in mind that FGM is practised in many countries, including in Europe. In the UK, many girls are at risk of falling victim of mutilation. It is time the EU and Member States embraced a real and viable strategy to end FGM on their territory, and therefore the ratification and implementation of the Istanbul Convention is our best hope.

Here belongs to the award of our female cinematographer, whose professionalism was able to deepen the concussion she was subjected to. Josephine — a 12-year-old Samburu baby girl — lay on the mlath in front of the hut, crying in pain and humiliation. Babice did her own “operation” with a blunt razor blade. It took about five minutes. Then the women carried Josephine to a hut decorated with flowers. The men, meanwhile, danced and celebrated the event by drinking tea with milk. Why am I telling you all this, ladies and gentlemen. In Europe, superstition prevails that only Muslims practice this medieval custom in Africa. It's not true.

Can a society continue when part of its youth, a priori vital force of development, is set aside and suffering. Therefore, there are two major investments that have no price! Two! The first is access to health. We need to increase the financing of family planning. The Commission must therefore increase its financial commitment to the 2020 family planning programme. We need to include sexual and reproductive rights in our estimates and therefore put an end to hypocrisy. The second investment is education, everywhere and for all, since no tradition can justify any sexual violence whatsoever. This is also why funding family planning is a crucial priority. It's not me who says it, it's Salamita, this 14-year-old Malian girl, who says: “At the health center, I learn a lot. I learned about the consequences of circumcision, for example.

And not just one, but several: the right to safety, health, physical integrity, and the most important of them all - the right to life. They're not worth more excuses. I don't care if it's cultural, but how can parents tell a girl they're going to mutilate her and put their four sentinel siblings to watch her? How can they hit her with an electrical cable and reduce it so that the mutilator arrives and remove the clitoris? This girl's body, Janeth, survived, but her soul stayed on the road. In more than twenty-nine countries in Africa and Asia, it continues to be practiced. And the laws are not complied with. And we can't say it's a distant thing. There are more than 500 thousand girls who have suffered it on European soil. In my country, Spain, eighteen thousand girls are at risk of being mutilated. That is why we have to fight firmly. And it's not just zero tolerance, but about zero impunity. For this it is very important the training of police, judges, asylum officials, doctors, educators... Prevention, education and awareness-raising is the key. But all this must go hand in hand with criminal law. Victims, mostly minors, had the right to live protected and the State must ensure them.

These practices also violate their rights to health and safety and physical integrity, and it is vital that the international community, governments and civil society mobilize against this form of violence. I think that preventing this violence should remain a priority for the European Union. Support should be provided for NGOs active in this field, to promote coordinated and systematic initiatives with third countries where female genital mutilation is practiced and continue to practice concrete prevention and awareness projects. For example, a good practice carried out in Europe is the study carried out last year by the European Institute for Gender Equality, intended to provide an estimate of the number of girls at risk of mutilation in six countries of the Union. We therefore continue to work on concrete projects that lead to the eradication of this atrocious practice and we must invest in assistance, culture and education, with greater determination. Europe cannot fail to take into account the worrying data emerging every day and must strengthen cross-sectoral cooperation.

In October, in Parliament, I heard an account of a victim of circumcision explaining how she watched her two girls day and night, in the street, in front of school, in front of her house to prevent them from being abducted and excised. It's a freezing story. What should we do for these millions of victims, also in Europe?

What we are facing is not just habit or stereotype or tradition: it is the problem of taboo, and taboo is something which is deeply rooted in society and is sustainable over centuries. Some of you spoke about the need to change the culture. I fully agree with that, but it will need more time and more intensive action, and also public debate because one of the features of the taboo is that it is something we do not speak about, something we do not want to hear about, something which we close our eyes to, and we don’t want to deal with the problem. That is why it is so important to discuss it. Also, I want to thank all of you who emphasised the importance of the Istanbul Convention and its ratification in all the Member States. I can tell you I feel a certain bitterness after some recent debates in certain Member States, because I heard opinions from some national parliaments that the Istanbul Convention goes against the traditional family, or against the best traditions in the EU. We have to fight that opinion and we have to convince those who want to defend traditional family, by saying that it is not a good tradition to accept and tolerate violence against women and children. We still have many Member States which have not yet ratified the convention, so I want to ask all of you, who can influence public opinion and political decision making in your states, to please do that, because we need it. The Istanbul Convention is a very efficient legislative instrument, not only against female genital mutilation but also against forced marriages, forced abortions and forced sterilisation – all those horrible things which women in the EU still have to face. We must help to ensure they are not exposed to such practices, and female genital mutilation is a particularly barbaric habit that we have to get rid of. Let’s protect good traditions in the EU. Let’s not protect traditions which serve as an excuse for barbaric habits. I agree with all of you who spoke about the need to come forward with efficient actions along the lines of prevention, protection and prosecution. I fully agree. I am sure that the Commission will propose a series of actions along those lines. To conclude, I would like to share with you some experience from practice, taking the example of the field of prevention. We try to involve men, as well as women, in prevention, and we have heard many good reflections from fathers who have started to fight against this practice, saying that their daughters must not be exposed to it. This is a good sign, although we need many more to get on board. As for prosecution, it has some downsides because what see in practice is that girls are taken for a holiday to Africa, where this procedure is done. The crime has thus been committed outside the EU, where there is no European jurisdiction, and it is extremely difficult to prove that those who took the girls to Africa knew what was going on. It is difficult to prove, and we have to do much better in that regard. There is also a connection with prevention and the need to ensure that society does not turn a blind eye, because very often it is known beforehand that a girl is planning to go to Africa. At school, or in the neighbourhood, people may be aware of this. We therefore need society too to be active and to help potential victims of this horrible practice. My last comment is on prosecution. Some of you spoke about female genital mutilation being both physical and psychological torture. We have horrible cases in which family members – mothers, grandmothers, fathers – have been prosecuted for this practice, or for assisting with it on their daughter or granddaughter. Then the victims have experienced further trauma by seeing their mothers or fathers prosecuted. These are the reflections from practice which show that this is an extremely complex phenomenon, requiring a very careful but proactive approach. I am sure that, when we join forces in making the links between prevention, protection and prosecution, we can change a lot, but we have to work together.

This is a fundamental pillar, I would say, of the work that Commissioner Hahn and I together with the President and all of our colleagues have done in these months and years to reconfirm, recommit and give strong credibility to the European Union perspective of the entire region of the Western Balkans.  I say European Union perspective, I do not say European perspective, because we have to start from the simple truth and the self-evidence that the Western Balkans are European already. They are part of Europe historically and geographically. If you look at the borders, the Western Balkans are within the Member States of the European Union. We share a cultural heritage, we share the same interests at present, and we share some of the challenges at present, and we will share a common future inside our European Union. There is in the Western Balkan strategy which we have just adopted, a clear path indicated for the Western Balkans and for all our six partners in the Western Balkans to finally join the European Union on a merit—based process but with a clear, political commitment on our side to have this perspective credible and finally coming through. Over the last three years, we have achieved already incredible results. Our investments are increasing in the Western Balkans, our economic ties are as strong as they have ever been. Our trade is constantly growing – I believe it’s 75% or something like this. Our security is more and more connected and our foreign and security policy is more and more coordinated. Out of the six, two of the Western Balkan partners we have – Montenegro and Albania – are 100% aligned with our common foreign and security policy positions. This means that we are together already, and we have seen this very clearly. A couple of years ago, when we called on them to manage together the refugee flows that were crossing the Balkans, we realised that we were one. We were, as we say in the Mediterranean, on the same boat. We were on the same side of the problem and of the solution. So now we are facing a reality which is that the Western Balkans are European. They want to clearly invest in the future membership of their countries in the European Union. The people, especially the younger generations, are determined to see their future inside the European Union and the leaderships have shown commitment and political courage to make the reforms needed to bring their countries in that direction. This strategy today gives a shared, unequivocal, concrete perspective for European Union integration for each and every one of the six partners. It has its own pace, with its own specificities and different conditions but the direction is clear, and it is one direction. I would like to stress this, because the strategy addressing the entire region and each of the six individual is an important element if we want to understand the sense of direction of the region. The region will succeed together or fail together. There is no possibility for dividing the prospects. Again, obviously it is merit—based, but history and geography tells us the perspective is one, and as one we address this situation in the strategy. Of course, at the core of all of this process is the need for reforms; not the European Union need for reforms but the citizens of the Western Balkans’ need for reforms. Wherever you travel in the Western Balkans, young people especially tell you that they feel Europeans. They want to have the same opportunities, the same guarantees, the same standards and rights, the same rights, the same fundamental freedoms, the same systems of governance and the same environment that our friends, colleagues and relatives share inside the European Union, and this means the citizens of the Western Balkan countries are asking for reforms so that they can enjoy the same rights, protections and standards as the citizens of the European Union.  Over the last few years Commissioner Hahn and I have been travelling very often to the entire region. We have seen and we are seeing a lot of ongoing reforms, with courage and determination and in the best cases with an approach that is an approach of national unity, because these challenges are never wise to be taken as political divides but more as a generational challenge for the leaderships of these countries. All of this has told us a simple truth. As I mentioned, the people and the leaders of the Western Balkans have made a clear choice – the choice of bringing their countries inside the European Union – and today we are telling them that we have made the same choice. We are not setting a target nor a deadline, but we are setting a realistic perspective of timing – 2025 as a perspective. The process is merit—based and it depends on the pace and the success of negotiations and reforms, and let me stress this very clearly that this is a realistic perspective which is true for the countries that are currently negotiating, but also for the countries that will start negotiations in the coming months – and I believe and hope that there will be others starting negotiations soon – which will have exactly the same realistic timeframe and perspective. As I said, this is a challenge and this is a process, not for one or two countries, but for the entire region. In the past few years, as I was saying, we have seen great determination and commitment from citizens and from leaders in the region. It has not always been easy. Actually, it has been very difficult from time to time. There have been political crises; there have been difficult political and electoral cycles; there have been slower and faster periods of progress. Overall, though, the sense of direction in these years has been absolutely clear. All of the six have always kept moving forward towards the European Union integration path. The sense of direction has been clear. The point is sustaining the sense of direction, bringing results and walking this path together. When we talk about the path towards the European Union, there is plenty of langue de bois – benchmarks, chapters, criteria. Once someone from the region told me: ‘my citizens couldn’t care less about how many chapters we open or we close. They don’t ‘get’ what it means by opening or closing chapters’. I think that many citizens actually get it very well, but the point is that this is not about technicalities or bureaucracy. This is real life; things that have an impact on societies that transform societies from within. It’s about guaranteeing opportunities and European standards in different fields from the economy to fundamental rights and freedoms, just to mention a couple of them. The whole process might sound technical, but it is indeed not abstract at all. It has concrete impact, it is real and it is already taking place. The process itself is leading to transformation that is positive, both for the economies and for the societies and for the governance. This strategy reconfirms a commitment and makes it explicit and clear. As I said, the door is open, we want you in. There is a need for some work to be done on both sides and we are ready to do this work together, but it also means a couple of months of very intense work that we have ahead of us. We have come somehow to the moment of truth: 2018 can be the year when this process becomes not only more credible, but also irreversible. We will have the Commission’s annual report in April; we will have the EU Western Balkans Summit in Sofia – the first one for 15 years, Thessaloniki was the last on – and ultimately possible Council decisions in June. The strategy supports this agenda with very concrete initiatives that I imagine Commissioner Hahn will describe in more detail. Six of them will cover all the key areas and I would just mention the headlines: rule of law, security, social and economic development, connectivity and the digital agenda – and let me translate this as it also means, for example, bringing the costs of roaming down which is one of the very concrete things that has an impact on the citizen’s life – support for reconciliation and good neighbourly relations. We have ahead of us very intense and ambitious months. Together we can make 2018 a turning point – the moment when the progress towards EU membership becomes irreversible and tangible for all. Our message is: ‘Let’s make it happen’. We are not passing a message saying that you need to be patient. This is not the message we are passing to our friends in the Western Balkans. The message is: ‘Let’s make it happen’. Let’s bring the Western Balkans inside the European Union not in a faraway future but in our generation on the basis of serious, concrete and tough work that we are ready to do together with our partners in the region. Let me add two last words. One is that this is a reflection also on the future of Europe, and it is not by chance that President Juncker mentioned this in his State of the Union speech here in this Parliament in September. This means that the European Union is imagining and considering its future not with 27 Member States but potentially with more, and we say this clearly in the strategy and are starting to get ready for that. Obviously, this doesn’t only depend on us. It depends on the path we will walk together. However, we are serious on this and I guess this is the first time, in these difficult times, that we are seriously having a reflection on that and I think this is a major step forward. My second and last point is that this is a challenge, and a generational challenge, not just for the Commission, not just for our partners in the Western Balkans, and not just for the Council. This is also a challenge for the European Parliament and I believe that we need to be in this together. The role that the European Parliament has played in our relations with the Western Balkans has been critical. I believe we need to continue working together to make this a success and to make this happen.

I would like to use the opportunity to thank the House for all your valuable support in the past couple of years, for your interest, and your dedication in dealing with this issue. In particular, I know many Members are travelling to the region, working and dealing with people, including colleagues, in the region, and it is extremely important to embrace our friends in the region in this way in order to make progress. I believe today is a big day for the countries of the Western Balkans and also for the European Union. Maybe some colleagues in the Western Balkans have not yet discovered the fact that it is a big day, but some things take time. That we have decided on and adopted the Balkans Strategy today is, in a way, a window of opportunity, in particular for the countries in the region. We confirm that the door to our Union remains open: it is open beyond any doubt, with, as Federica Mogherini has already said, a 2025 perspective. Not more, but not less, and I think this is important to recall. Our six partners in the region are already part of Europe, not only geographically but also emotionally and culturally. They are surrounded institutionally by EU Member States. Also, the European project would not be complete without them. We have a common heritage, a history, and a common future defined by our shared opportunities and challenges. The migration crisis, for example, has shown very clearly that there are certain topics on which, in a way, borders do not exist when it comes to addressing a particular topic affecting all of us. The Union has repeatedly affirmed this European perspective and we have created positive momentum over the last few years, in difficult times. But we must now go a strategic step further. We must use our ‘soft power’ of attraction, this magnetic force of the European Union, more efficiently and smartly. Because inclusion is the best security policy for European citizens. The firm, merit-based prospect of EU membership is in our own political, security and economic interest. It is a geostrategic investment in a strong, united Europe, based on common values, and we must not leave a vacuum on our doorstep for others to step into. That is why today we reaffirm this shared European perspective, this commitment to a Union that is ready to expand. Let’s be clear: a credible enlargement perspective is not a free lunch. It requires a tough transformation from our partners. They must now ‘walk the talk’ and deliver. The criteria are clear and they will not change: they are not technical, but are essentially about European values. It is important to stress that the Balkans Strategy is not an invitation or an opportunity to soften our conditions or our agreements – quite the opposite. It must be clear that we will stick to what has been agreed and what is necessary for the future. Therefore, progress along their EU path depends fully on the objective merits and concrete results achieved by each individual country. There are no shortcuts on this European path. Despite all the progress in the countries, a lot remains to be done, and we are very clear about this in the strategy. The Western Balkans countries must now urgently tackle the key areas, starting with the rule of law, fundamental rights and the fight against corruption and organised crime. Also, on economic reforms and tackling high unemployment the countries must make significant progress. One thing is especially important. All countries must work even harder on reconciliation and ensure good neighbourly relations. All pending bilateral issues must be settled in a binding way ahead of accession. Let’s be clear, and I think this was already stressed and mentioned today by President Juncker: the European Union and its Member States will simply refuse to import unresolved status issues, so any new Member State has to resolve its bilateral conflicts and issues with neighbouring countries. The Union itself must also improve its support. This strategy therefore includes, as already mentioned by the High Representative, six new flagship initiatives with, altogether, 57 very concrete individual, innovative actions. It is about the rule of law, security and migration; a focus on socio-economic development; increasing connectivity, including the aforementioned digital agenda and pushing harder for reconciliation. The Union itself needs to ensure that it will be ready – institutionally and financially – to welcome new Member States once the conditions are met. This will include specific provisions in the next multiannual financial framework, and refocused pre-accession aid before that. Until 2020, we will not need additional money but we will be able to provide the necessary financial means – it is about EUR 500 million – by restructuring and by further and better targeting of our current budget. I want to be very clear about another key point of the strategy: all Western Balkans countries can move on the EU path in a 2025 perspective. Yes, Montenegro and Serbia are the current so-called front-runners, but others can catch up, and present front-runners can fall behind if they don’t deliver. So it is not 100% sure who will cross the finishing line first. As a sailor, I might say: enlargement remains a regatta and not a convoy. So once again, 2025 is not a fixed target. It is an incentive. There are no guarantees. It is actually very ambitious, but doable: a best-case scenario, if you like. Whether it is achieved or not will depend entirely on the merits and results of each country. We are not giving a present to the Western Balkans. Joining the EU is a generational choice based on fundamental values. We are making them a sincere and transparent offer. The Union, but especially the leaders of the region, must now show and assume responsibility for making this historical opportunity a reality, and respond to the European aspirations of their citizens. In that respect, I strongly believe that this perspective date can provide the necessary positive pressure in order to tackle all the necessary issues and reform necessities. In this strategic project, once again, we both count on the continued support of this House because, as was said, a lot has been done but much more will have to be done in the next couple of months and years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 154, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "David McALLISTER", "mepid": "124806", "text": " Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen. Federica Mogherini and Johannes Hahn have both just pointed out that the six countries of the Western Balkans are important partners of the European Union. We are closely connected geographically, culturally and economically. The stability, security and prosperity of our entire continent can only be ensured in the long term if we, as the European Union, help these six countries to overcome structural challenges and regional tensions. Today's strategy sets out a concrete path and a detailed action plan for these countries to become a member of the EU. This underpins their European perspective. From my own experience as permanent rapporteur for Serbia, I know that the prospect of joining the EU has already helped to implement necessary political and economic reforms and improve people's daily lives. These incentives need to be maintained and further developed, and that is why the strategy now presented is an important signal. I would like to express my gratitude to Federica Mogherini and Johannes Hahn and all other stakeholders for their good preparatory work. Nevertheless, the requirements are clear: the specific date of accession of a new Member State will depend solely on when the country actually and fully fulfils the strict legal, political and economic conditions. As different as the six countries of the Western Balkans are, they all face similar challenges. This must be tackled in a sustainable way: strengthen the rule of law, guarantee the fight against corruption and organised crime, freedom of expression and media, make the economies more competitive and bilateral conflict in the spirit of good neighbourly to solve relationships.

It is certain that enlargement towards the Balkans will remain a priority of the Union in 2018 and equally in 2019 during the Romanian Presidency. While looking to the future, I can only start by stating the obvious, and the most important thing, namely that our Union is not completed nor safe or stable without the Western Balkans. This region is key for the stability and the security of our Union and for its citizens. And the integration of the Western Balkans into Europe is in the interests of both sides. This is why the S&amp;D Group has always been the first promoter of enlargement as one of the most successful EU policies. Today we are facing common challenges in the region which include migration, radicalisation, the rise of nationalism, tensions and terrorism. It is important not to lose momentum and come together with a common answer to the very many problems. We are the only reliable and credible partner in the region for the region. This strategy is a step in the right direction, but we need to do more than talk, and this has to be reflected in the future multiannual financial framework. What we need today is more EU initiatives, programmes and investment in the region. Considering the rising inequalities in the region, it is necessary to focus on the real social policies and programmes to tackle the problems of growing gaps. The Balkans were playing with history and nationalism. This is exactly where our Union should play an important role in fostering more regional cooperation, cohesion and dialogue.

All countries of the Western Balkans have a natural place in the European Union and each of them shares a strong desire to join. Fulfilling these ambitions must be a key priority in the coming decade. As rapporteur for Montenegro, I am very pleased to see 2025 affirmed officially now as a target date for accession. The support for a merit—based regatta principle in which each country is assessed on its own merits and rights is also to be welcomed. Montenegro is doing particularly well. The ‘more for more’ approach is vital to maintaining confidence in the process and to preserving the integrity of a rules-based approach. New EU Member States should also not seek to discriminate against those still waiting in the queue to join over border issues. 2025 is some way off still, but we cannot ignore rising scepticism in some parts of the EU to all future enlargement, with particular concerns about corruption and organised crime, and we may even see one referendum on the issue in France. I sincerely hope that the UK, which has invested a lot of political capital in the stability of the Western Balkans over many years, is still able to carry on participating in joint EU projects post—Brexit. The glue that holds the region together is Euro-Atlantic integration, and any disruption would have devastating consequences across the whole continent. My hopes had been raised that we were very close to securing a solution to the Macedonia name question finally. I welcome the recent efforts from both sides’ governments on this matter, although it now seems that such hopes have been dashed by populist protest, which is deeply regrettable.

The ALDE Group supports the process of enlarging the European Union to countries in this region, believing that the integration of the entire Western Balkans will contribute to the stability and progress of our continent and security. I welcome the Commission's decision to continue its membership negotiations with Serbia and Montenegro, assuming that opportunities for new member accession can be realized by 2025. Depending on the achievements and fulfillment of accession conditions, the strategy also opens the door to Macedonia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo. This is even more important than the said date. Respected, except necessary reforms in the exercise of the rule of law, fundamental rights, independence of the judiciary, the functioning of democratic institutions, the inclusivity of parliaments and the coordination of the ruling coalitions with the opposition when it comes to reforms directly related to the European perspective, seems important to highlight the following. The countries of the Western Balkans will have to more effectively discard nationalism, leave the past to history, regulate open border issues. There is a warning that the EU will not accept into its membership of countries that bring old conflicts into the Union.

But fifteen years after the 2003 Thessaloniki Summit, which was intended to be the first milestone of this long road map, this new enlargement has never appeared so chimerical. Indeed, not only is the lack of progress evident on most of the negotiating chapters, but the enthusiasm on both sides has been considerably blunt since, in addition to the massive disapproval of public opinions of the historic Member States, 51% of Serbs aged 18 to 29 declared themselves hostile to accession in 2016.

What you said there was no guarantee of the date is extremely important. But without the full European integration of the Western Balkans, the project of peaceful reunification of Europe will remain incomplete. This is one of the reasons why Bulgaria and the Bulgarian Presidency have put as a top priority the need for a clear European perspective for the countries of the region.

I also hope that both Commissioner Gabriel and Bulgaria will have success in finding such a road map for reducing roaming in the Western Balkans. There are many historical wounds in the Balkans, which can heal only on the path of European integration. It is the only medication that can prevent them from reopening. In this regard, I welcome the signing of the treaty between Sofia and Skopje.

The EU has often broken its own rules during the euro crisis and the migration crisis. This has divided and destabilised the EU. The consequences, see Brexit, are well known. If the EU wanted to join the EU in this Constitution, it would have to reject its own accession. It is also grotesque that the EU, which trusts its own right, wants to discipline Poland as supreme teachers because of alleged shortcomings in the rule of law. If this continues, the question will not arise which six states will join the EU next, but which six states will follow the British exit next. Preventing this through wise institutional consolidation is the imperative of the next few years. This is more important than the accession of other states before this task, which is completely subordinate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 183, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Franz OBERMAYR", "mepid": "96981", "text": " Mr President!

In the meantime, it has become apparent that this idea, which is certainly commendable at first glance, is more difficult to implement than it might seem in the flowery theory. The Commission itself regularly points out that the rule of law — politely — is in great need of reform in a large range of candidate countries. For example, the Commissioners, including Mr Hahn, have to deal almost every month with the fact that organised crime and corruption are widespread at all levels of government and administration. In addition, of course, at my written request in March 2017, the Commission itself acknowledged the knowledge of ISIS's recruitment camp in Montenegro and in May of the same year, again due to my concerns, had to admit Islamic radicalisation of the Western Balkans. So did the German Federal Intelligence Service — Mr President, you may have missed the fact that I have one and a half minutes to take account of this interruption, thank you very much. This was also the case with the German Federal Intelligence Service, which stated that Saudi Arabia in particular is installing radical Salafist-Wahabiti Islam in the Western Balkans through enormous financial resources.

Today's European Union must overcome scepticism towards further enlargement, one of the bloc's most successful policies since its creation. The population of the Western Balkans accounts for only 3.6% of the population of the European Union, but its importance for upgrading the European project in the 21st century is far more significant. This is a time of far-reaching reforms to eliminate existing disputed generating instability and lagging. But resistance should be expected, especially from so-called veto groups to which the status quo ensures the enjoyment of unjustified privileges to the detriment of the majority in society. In addition, the Western Balkans are increasingly a point of intersection of the interests of different forces. With this document, the European Union demonstrates that it wants to invest in its own perspective, security and stability. The success of the process depends not only on the success of opening and closing negotiating chapters, but also on strong support from citizens in the candidate country. At this moment, this support for membership of the European Union among the citizens of the Western Balkans varies considerably.

One: six states are not at the same stage of the accession process, and this is especially pointed out by Commissioner Hahn Vi. If we want all six to have an equal chance in accession by 2025, then an individual approach is needed and the opening of negotiations with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Albania and Kosovo as soon as possible. Otherwise, they will not be able to catch up with advanced Montenegro and Serbia. The second message: it is good that we are increasing IPE funding, but we also need to step up our efforts for successful use, especially in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The goal is to find solutions to use, not reasons for blocking. Likewise, the Juncker Fund to direct as much as possible towards these Member States, we don't really have projects there. And third: I particularly support the incentive to resolve unresolved issues with neighbours. It's all important. And the issue of borders, cultural treasures and respect for minority rights, but I would especially put the issue of the missing.

Secondly, we should not forget that we are talking about a region of 18 million people, surrounded by EU Member States, which is still in fragile and shaky shape. It is not necessary, I think, to reiterate why it is so important, not least in terms of European interests, to give those people a European perspective.  Thirdly, I have heard several times about an accession date of 2025; some Members even talked about all of the countries joining the Union by 2025. That is an indicative date, a prospect, and it should demonstrate that if there is strong political will, and dedication in the countries themselves, then it is possible to conclude negotiations and join the Union. But this means, once again, strong political will, a readiness to carry out necessary reforms and, in particular, to prove the sustainability of measures which have been called for. So in a way we have learned our lessons from previous accession negotiations and therefore we are now talking more and understand better that what matters is the process rather than negotiations.  A process takes time and therefore it is necessary to strike the right balance between the prospect of a lasting – not to say long-lasting – process and keeping motivation and stimulation alive. Therefore, it was necessary to indicate that there can be light at the end of the tunnel and link it to a certain date, but we are not saying that everything will happen without any fulfilment of conditions. It is important to stress this again and again.  Finally, I have two requests for Members. Firstly, I want to appeal to all of you. If we are to continue this process it is definitely necessary to have compromise in one form or another. That is democracy and democracy means finding a compromise in which everybody has to give in a little bit in order to get more. This is important for making the necessary progress. We also need to understand that on our side. The second request: I have felt this very strong support here, and I am also speaking on behalf of Federica Mogherini, but we are all responsible and called upon to communicate back home about what we are talking about here, what we are thinking, and what we believe to be necessary, for today I believe that the bigger challenge will be to convince our own citizens. We have to start communicating to our citizens why all this is necessary, why it is also in our interest, and we have to start doing it today and not in two or three years’ time. Therefore, we should bear in mind that either we as Europeans export stability or else we will import instability and keep the level of instability that we are still facing in the region today. So it is in our own interest, but of course our friends and partners in the region have to do their homework: they have to do what is necessary in order not only to meet European standards, but also to live up to the European values to which we are all committed and dedicated.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 228, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": " Thank you, Commissioner, for this conclusion, which you have very readily outlined.

For the first time since independence, a transition of power has begun. We still do not know where this transition will end. Europeans would like, first and foremost, to accompany the people of Zimbabwe on the path of political and economic reform. We want to sustain their hope that real change is possible and help them realise their aspiration to democracy and social justice. This is our offer to the country: we are ready to intensify our cooperation and be with you in this moment of your history. It will be up to the people of Zimbabwe to decide the new course of the country. Yet I believe it is already quite clear what kind of change the people of Zimbabwe are asking for. Zimbabwe is a country of talented people with good education. They are asking for human rights, democracy and the rule of law. They are asking for an opportunity to prove their talents and put the country’s economy back on track. The country needs structural change that will require strong popular backing. Reconciliation and an inclusive dialogue are essential, and they are possible. They will require, first and foremost, respect for the constitutional order, the rule of law and the fundamental rights of all citizens. We then hope that the new authorities will organise inclusive, transparent and credible elections later this year. A peaceful electoral campaign and credible elections can set the country on track towards positive change. It is precisely for this reason that we have already started to assist the Zimbabwe Election Commission in establishing a credible electoral role through biometric voter registration. We are also supporting the local media with training on how to cover elections, and also inter-party dialogue and civic and voter education, and this support could be enhanced. I would also support the idea of an electoral observation mission by the European Union, provided that the required conditions are fulfilled and that we receive an invitation from the Government of the country. The economic situation also needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. We count on the Government to reengage quickly and substantively with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. On our side, we will continue to work very closely with international financial institutions towards a package of measures to stabilise the economy and guarantee basic social services. The people of Zimbabwe have the opportunity to close a difficult chapter in their history and start anew. It is a delicate and decisive moment for the country. All those who are working for progress in Zimbabwe can count on us in strong cooperation with the United Nations, the African Union and the Southern African Development Community. It is now up to the new authorities to make the first move. A first and encouraging discussion took place in Addis Ababa last week between the President and Commissioner Mimica. Our next steps will depend entirely on the new Government’s actions and its commitment to change. We see an entire people hoping for progress and for true democracy. The aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe are our own aspirations and we want to make sure that this opportunity is not wasted and that the mistakes of the past do not happen again.

High Madam Representative! In fact, I can repeat these encouraging words, although recent political developments in Zimbabwe show hope for democratisation of the country, restoring the rule of law and improving the standards of protection of human rights. I welcome President Mnangagwa's promise to hold free elections in the second half of 2018 and respect the will of the people regardless of the outcome. We count everyone that the president keeps his word and that power will be handed over and established in a fully democratic and peaceful manner. As you mentioned, the European Union is ready to support the elections by organising an observation mission in Zimbabwe. In addition, it was recently decided to launch three projects worth around 3 million euros to support the rule of law within the European Development Fund. Restoring democratic rule of law in Zimbabwe will make the international community more likely to provide development aid to the country. It is also important to maintain stability in this region of Africa. It is important to remember how the events of a few months ago affected the neighbouring countries of Zimbabwe. An example here is Botswana, which has welcomed thousands of refugees from this country in a short time. At the same time, ensuring internal stabilisation is crucial to boosting Zimbabwe's appeal to investors and opening up its economy to the world. These are extremely important issues in view of improving the economic situation after many years of stagnation and impoverishment of citizens due to high levels of inflation. We will closely follow developments in Zimbabwe in the coming months.

During the negotiations for the surrender of Mugabe, we were left with bated breath because we feared that the situation could get out of hand, resulting in violence. Fortunately the alternation took place peacefully and the new president took office without any particular problems. The international community even took part in the settlement ceremony, a sign that the handover of power between Mugabe and his former deputy has found liking. Today the country is aiming for the general election due by July, if we can give credence to the president's recent statement. That would be so respected the normal electoral process. On this, too, we must recognise that the country's new leaders are giving positive signals. Transparency and impartiality are at stake on the issue of election. The current president was the first to promise them, calling with serenity also the assumption of the involvement of an election observation mission by the European Union, as already mentioned by the High representative. The elections are dutiful, because the current power is marked by a lack of legitimacy as a transitional regime and must therefore be confronted with the people of Zimbabwe in an electoral match that we would like to compete. Herein lies my concern: Zimbabwe is today in a political situation of hegemony of ZANU-PF, the party of Mugabe and Mnangagwa. The opposition, once embodied by Morgan Tsvangirai, shows clear signs of fatigue and this could contribute to the devaluation of political offers, i.e., lowering the protections of the townspeople of Zimbabwe.

But Emmerson Mnangagwa has a history in that country. Emmerson Mnangagwa is a comrade of Mugabe, who was involved in the massacres in Matabeleland. Now you never make peace with nice people — I understand very well — and it is, of course, a step forward that this change has taken place peacefully. But we must also realise that there is much more wrong in that country than just an economic problem. Indeed, I believe that Emmerson Mnangagwa will pursue a different kind of economic policy, and that this is also good for international investors. But if we just gave him the benefit of the doubt because he's not Robert Mugabe, then we're gonna miss a chance. The elections are in July or June. After the elections, this government, which is made up of very many soldiers, gained new legitimacy. Before that time, they are looking for legitimacy. I think now is the time to ask for democratic change as well. For example, the public order security act can be changed. The country has been engaged in constitutional reforms for decades. There is no reason to wait until after the elections to drop that demand with Mr. Mnangagwa. Civil society is currently weak.

We understand very well that this remains to be done, but the expectations are there and we can help move in the right direction. Lastly, I would like to thank Parliament for your continuing work to promote and defend human rights and democratisation in Zimbabwe. I know that it has been long—standing, constant and consistent work, for which I thank you, and also for keeping the country on our international agenda. I am looking forward to continuing our good cooperation across the institutions in the European Union to make sure that the changes are not cosmetic and that progress is really made.

We are holding this debate, I believe, because we care. We care about Turkey, we care about the Turkish people, we care about Turkey’s democracy, security and stability, and we care about security and stability in the Turkish region because it is also our region. Sometimes we refer to Turkey only as a candidate country. Let me stress one thing that is obvious: it is first and foremost, through my lens, a regional player that shares the same geographic space with us. We have disagreements and we are extremely clear on them. We have what can probably be termed a frank dialogue and, let me say this very clearly: our dialogue with Turkey is today more important than ever. The negative trend of the human rights situation in the country has not been reversed. There have been some small steps in certain human rights cases, but violations have continued, affecting prominent civil society figures, users of social media, medical staff, and the list could continue. This is on top of the initial violations we have seen in recent years, which have not been resolved. Last Friday, Commissioner Hahn and I issued a statement focusing in particular on the unprecedented decision by the Turkish authorities to contradict a ruling by the Constitutional Court. This decision goes against the Turkish Constitution and it casts serious doubt on the independence of Turkey’s justice system. The ongoing state of emergency also remains a key issue of concern. We all know that it was established in one of the most difficult moments in Turkish history, we remember those hours very well, in which we expressed our concern, our proximity with the people and the leadership of Turkey after the attempted coup d’état. Yet, one-and-a-half years later, the state of emergency has allowed measures that go well beyond those initially foreseen, and this has to be clearly stated. In parallel, it is true, there has been some work to normalise bilateral relations between Turkey and the EU Member States, and this is good news but I want to be very clear: human rights and fundamental freedoms should apply to all Turkish citizens, to all of them in the same way. In our partnership with Turkey, as I said, we have always been open and frank. We know that Turkey has faced, and is facing, incredible challenges and we have to acknowledge this: terrorist attacks on its soil, an attempted coup, a difficult refugee crisis and a war just next door. We understand Turkey’s concerns, for instance, about the situation at its borders. Turkey has the full right, and I would even say the duty, to provide safety and security to Turkish citizens living near the border with Syria, yet we are deeply worried about the new front that has been opened in northern Syria. We are worried, first of all, for humanitarian reasons. The new clashes have already resulted in civilian casualties and thousands have been displaced. Humanitarian access must be guaranteed to all those in need. The United Nations is warning that the humanitarian situation right across Syria is definitely not improving, and the people of Syria cannot afford a new front and a new crisis, adding to the other ones still ongoing in the country.  Beyond the humanitarian tragedy, the Afrin offensive could have political consequences on the internal balances inside the future Syria, on the region at large and on the potential for political negotiations, because the new escalation of violence could push further away the chances of a political solution to the conflict. We need – all of us – to concentrate all our energies on supporting the UN-led negotiations in Geneva. That is where any concerns should be raised and addressed.  The war in Syria is not over yet. People are still dying even if it is not headline news. That is happening in Afrin as well as in Idlib and elsewhere. Opening new fronts is no solution and I am afraid it will not make Turkey more secure. Real security can come only from a negotiated political solution to the conflict. We believe that all military action should focus on UN-listed terrorist organisations, not others; and it should not make peace harder to achieve. Let me also reiterate that the European Union remains committed to the unity, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Syria. We have to be extremely careful about the moves we make today, in order to avoid consequences for the future set-up in the country. Peace in Syria will require everyone’s contribution and Turkey, as one of the guarantors of the Astana Process, has an essential role to play, as well as special responsibility. The agreement reached through the Astana Process on the escalation zones needs to be pursued and implemented, including in northern Syria. We are working, together with the United Nations and all the international community, to make sure that our second Brussels Conference on the future of Syria and the region, which we will host next spring, supports the UN-led process in an effective and, indeed, a decisive manner, in particular with regard to the prospects for the future, and the need to make sure that each and every Syrian citizen will find in Syria his or her own home, his or her own country, with a system and a prospect of inclusion, and recognition of diversity and the diverse composition of the country and society. That is the only way out of the conflict in a sustainable manner. Let me finish by saying that, as you probably know, President Erdoğan was in Rome yesterday, where he met Pope Francis. During the meeting – and I quote from the text supplied by the Holy See – ‘the Pope stressed the need to promote peace and reconciliation through dialogue and negotiation, with respect for human rights and international law’. I believe that we can all share the words of Pope Francis on this occasion. For our part, we will continue our dialogue with Turkey, as we do every single week and, indeed, on a daily basis. We will keep all channels of communication open, working to overcome our differences, working to manage our differences when they remain, and working to find common solutions. We do this for ourselves, we do it for the Turkish people, and we do it for peace, security and democracy in our common region, starting with Syria.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 273, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (FR) Madam President, first of all I would like to express my great concern about the human rights situation in Turkey. Last week, together with other colleagues, I had the opportunity to meet with Turkish academics and civil society organisations. The situation they portray, we know it, is always very serious. Since June 2016, thousands of people, government employees, military personnel, judges, journalists, teachers, civil society activists and academics have been acquainted with indictment, harassment, pressure and jail for imaginary crimes, which only serve to centralize power between hands of the current authorities. That is why we must put human rights at the heart of all discussions with the Turkish authorities, including at the forthcoming EU-Turkey summit. Moreover — and we have actively supported this position in this Parliament — we must redirect funds for Turkey's accession to civil society, to those who are committed to the preservation of freedoms. This is all the more urgent because I think it is impossible to continue to talk about membership. I have been a strong supporter of Turkey's enlargement for a long time. Today, in view of recent developments, I believe that a closer partnership is the way forward in the coming years. The question of human rights should, of course, be on the agenda. As part of this partnership, we must address issues of common interest, such as the Western Balkans. The discussion around our actions in this region should be frank and open, so that it can benefit the citizens of these countries and not be subject to hidden objectives.

But, for having done exactly that, you are now in a prison cell. While you cannot follow this debate, I hope your lawyers and family will inform you that we have not forgotten you and we will continue to plead for your release, as your arrests were politicised and arbitrary. Osman Kavala, Ahmet Şık and Selehattin Demirtaş are not the only innocent people in jail in Turkey. While the perpetrators of the heinous coup attempt must be prosecuted and brought to justice, many, many people have become victims of the massive crackdown on all democratic opposition voices. The numbers are mind-boggling – more than 150 000 people fired and more than 50 000 imprisoned. But remember that all these people have a faith, have a family and have friends who are hoping that normalisation is still possible. The state of emergency has led to a situation where the Government can rule by decree without parliamentary or judicial scrutiny. Every aspect of Turkish society has become securitised, meaning that all those who voice criticism of the Government’s policies are being labelled as terrorists or terrorist supporters. Legitimate and peaceful opposition is thus being silenced, in real life and on social media. In the past two weeks, almost 500 people were detained for peacefully opposing Turkey’s military operation in Afrin. There is also a structural problem with the lack of independence of the judiciary, and we witnessed last month how big that problem is. First, there was a ruling by the Constitutional Court to release jailed journalists Mehmet Altan and Şahin Alpay as their rights had been violated and, although the orders of the highest court were crystal clear, a local penal court decided to keep them in detention. Last week, we witnessed another travesty of justice. The wife and daughters of Turkey’s Amnesty International Chair were waiting in front of the gates of the prison in Izmir to welcome their loved one after eight months’ imprisonment. A judge had ruled earlier that day that he should be released, but within a couple of hours the same judge decided to order his rearrest. And, for all those people who lost their jobs by decree, there is so far little hope of remedy. High Representative Mogherini, the EU is preparing a mini summit with Turkish President Erdogan at the end of March. We could read in the papers that no preconditions have been put on the table, but I hope you can tell us what you expect in terms of results from such a meeting. We in Parliament expect the EU to be loud and clear on human rights in Turkey, as you were in your introduction just now, not only because these are the values on which our Union is based, and which Turkey as a candidate should adhere to, but also because we risk losing credibility and the support of a majority in Turkish society if we don’t stand up for their rights in these dark times.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 275, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, Turkey has been moving in the wrong direction for an EU candidate country for some time under President Erdoğan and, sadly, the war in Syria and the July 2016 coup attempt have provided ample opportunity for a more openly hostile approach by the AK Parti to Western democratic norms. We therefore see today a Turkey that openly violates civil and human rights at home and pursues a foreign policy objective directly opposed to the aims of its EU and NATO allies abroad.  The situation in Afrin is the starkest of those decisions yet, as only two days ago Turkey announced in somewhat sinister terms that nearly 1 000 so-called terrorists had been neutralised since the assault began on 20 January. By ‘neutralised’, we are to read ‘surrendered’, ‘captured’ or ‘killed’. By ‘terrorists’, we are to read ‘members of the Kurdish YPG’, who have been bravely fighting against Isis across northern Syria with the support of US troops, who continue to fight alongside the YPG. The Americans have refused Turkish requests to remove their troops, paving the way for a potential clash between Turkish and US forces. Such behaviour from a NATO ally and EU candidate country is extremely concerning. Finding a way back to the peace talks between Ankara and the Kurds in Turkey will be one of the keys to normalising politics in Turkey in future, but ahead of the presidential elections at the end of next year, such prospects seem a distant hope.  Furthermore, I hope that the welcomed re-election of President Anastasiades of Cyprus will lead to renewed reunification talks, where Turkish cooperation is again vital but has, to date, been lacking. Turkey has still not implemented the Ankara Protocols, recognised Cypriot rights to gas exploration, or accepted that it must withdraw its occupying forces from northern Cyprus. Turkey must do more, and it must do more to support the goodwill that exists on that island – but, sadly, that looks very unlikely in my opinion.

President Erdoğan is taking Turkey further and further away from European values and thus away from the EU. Erdoğan's Turkey will continue to move towards an unjust state. I will give just a few examples: systematic silence of the political opposition, massive restrictions on freedom of the press and freedom of expression, detention of judges, journalists, activists and citizens, and increasingly state prosecution of critical voices in social media. This lacks any understanding of freedom, the rule of law and democracy according to European standards. One thing is clear: a prospect of accession must always be realistic and, above all, presuppose a willingness for the Turkish Government to meet these criteria. But I do not see this willingness in view of the continuing disregard of human rights, fundamental rights and liberties under Erdoğan's leadership. Europe must therefore draw conclusions from this development. I say quite clearly that even if the recent constitutional changes were to be withdrawn, the accession negotiations must remain frozen. Because it is a matter of credibility: the EU is a community of values, we defend civil and human rights, and we also call for binding compliance with the Copenhagen criteria. The Turkish government itself must ask itself: does it want to be a community of values with the EU or does it want to be an illiberal autocracy? The latter definitely has no place in the EU. The military solo action in Afrin also questions Turkey's ability to alliances. This applies to the European Union, which also applies to NATO membership. Defence alliances are tied to shared values. With its actions in Afrin, the Turkish government is moving further from this common base of values.

And his brethren answered in Cyprus with vandalism against the newspaper. But I would like to tell you that a few days later, thousands of Turkish Cypriots found themselves on the streets supporting the newspaper's freedom of opinion and supporting their right to freely express themselves and to have an autonomous will for the future of their community and Cyprus. I shall conclude by calling on all of you to support the view that Turkey is now very close to the threshold of total removal from all notion of the rule of law, and this can be done with a clear mandate from the European Parliament to ourselves and to Turkey, that if it is not democratized the country will have to rethink the process before us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 278, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "Please try to keep the time limits, we're 15 minutes late.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 279, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Bodil VALERO", "mepid": "124993", "text": " on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. — Madam President!

A candidate country is expected to live up to the fundamental values of the EU, that is, respect for the principles of the rule of law and for fundamental civil and human rights. But Turkey's courts are not independent. People are accused of terrorism for no reason and are years in prison without trial. Freedom of the press and freedom of speech do not exist. Since 2016, over 6 million Turkish residents have been subjected to judicial investigations on suspicion of crime, sometimes only because of a view expressed on social media; 107,000 have lost the job without legal basis. Violence is never a long-term solution, no matter who uses it. I also suffer with all those killed and still killed in the conflict in southeastern Turkey, in terror attacks around Turkey and now also in the totally unjust war in northern Syria. Erdogan's declaration that he wants to keep the border free of terrorists does not hold, and we all know it. Turkey's attacks are attacks on another state, not defense, and therefore violate international law. Today, the world should instead thank the resistance and military efforts of all these brave women and men to defeat Daesh. We have them to thank too much. But our response is to silence watch as Turkey, with the help of Syrian rebels, slaughters Kurdish children, women and men in one of the most peaceful areas of Syria. An area that has also received many Syrian internally displaced people. Even after the first days of the war, I received a variety of pictures of injured and dead children sent to my phone. If I don't misremind myself then meant Erdogan that al Assad is a child killer, which is correct, but then what does he call himself? I am clearly concerned by the message our inaction sends both to Erdogan and to the residents of Afrin and the rest of Rojava. If we want to live up to our own principles and to international law, then we should forcefully protest and condemn the ongoing attack on Afrin. For example, we can stop all arms exports to Turkey.

The natural continuation of the previous operation “Euphrates Shield” is yet another installment of Erdogan's continued persecution of the Kurdish people. Never name was more tragically mocking. The twig that Erdogan juts towards Afrin, in fact, consists of the bombs of 72 warplanes assisted by dozens of tanks and land troops. A little more than two weeks after the start of operations begins the usual tragic numbers game. Civilian casualties could already be over 100. It therefore makes an impression to see Erdogan meet yesterday in Rome between armored streets and clashes between protesters and police, the Pope, the President of the Republic and Prime Minister Gentiloni. On the content of the talks maximum reserve. Surely, as a leak, a lot of space has been given to commercial themes, as Italy is one of Turkey's main partners. What I wonder and ask you: how much purges and violence does Erdogan have to carry out to spark at least a spark of outrage from European governments? A reaction that isn't facade? In less than a year since the attempted coup d'état, Turkey has become, as one well-known journalist calls it, a kind of autocracy with democratic simulacra. Anyone who dares to criticize Erdogan is jailed. At the same time, Syrian Kurds in Afrin, valiant soldiers in the war against Daesh, are killed in the embarrassed silence and complicit of the international community. How did we get to this point? The answers are many and range from economic entanglements to energy ones. But the real ace up Erdogan's sleeve is certainly that illegal migrant agreement accepted by the European Union in March 2016, which we repeatedly denounced. An agreement that allows him to keep up a surreal enlargement negotiation, which no one believes anymore and that goes permanently closed. It failed the EU and failed my government, the government of my country, by welcoming the Turkish Premier with the highest honours. We're under blackmail.

First it collides with Russia — let us remember the shooting down of a hunt — then deals with Moscow, then with Tehran to arrive at the Astana treaties, to counter the advance of the Kurds, brave protagonists of the defeat of Isis in Raqqa. Now it launches into a military venture aimed at crushing Kurdish-Syrian Ypg militias and securing a security zone on its border. But what is really happening in this war no one knows, is not very clear, even if some things seem to be certain, that is loss of life by the Syrian military, it seems at least about twenty only Saturday. But what should outrage us seems to be a hundred civilian casualties, according to Kurdish hospital sources, of whom many women and children. Women and children, the High Representative is not moved. It is true that the Pope received Erdogan, but knowing Pope Francis I am sure that, in addition to telling him about the human rights of persecuted Christians, he will also have accounted for him for these civilian casualties. But we know this Europe — the High Representative is master of it — in this compartmentmenting human rights. In some cases they are very serious and the international courts are invoked, in other cases it speaks so generically as if it had been, I don't know, a carnival joke. Instead this happens, it is true, in a region to which we also belong, even if Turkey is not in Europe. Someone who is now repentant and who says that he no longer wants Turkey's membership was telling us that Turkey is Europe. Well, let's leave it at that. An offensive that wants to continue a path that is decidedly contrasting with the strategy of NATO and the United States, and This should at some point be counted by the USA. Now this offensive, in Erdogan's textual words, aims to nip in the bud a force seen as open threat to his safety. So this Erdogan strategy, which is very dangerous for our future, for our security, is very dangerous. But this Europe is vile.

The Turkish judiciary has long ceased to be relied upon — the law of arbitrariness in courts and authorities is more likely to prevail. New groupings are always targeted. While Kurds and alleged Gülen supporters were initially targeting, almost everyone now has to fear for their freedom, who even makes an ill-considered statement. Any criticism seems to become a criminal offence and is equated with terrorism. Anyone who is not arrested will be released, expropriated, otherwise silenced — there are enough examples. All these people — including one-third of judges and lawyers, one-tenth of police officers, 110 000 civil servants and teachers, 5 000 academics — all dismissed; all these people are faced with nothing, no financial support, no pension entitlements, nowhere can they find a new job.

It is the legitimate right of Turkey to ensure the security of its border. As the Turkish military operation in Afrin is unfolding, civilian casualty numbers – including women and children – are rising and the humanitarian situation is worsening day by day. Refugees and residents in the Afrin district of Syria are trapped once again between warring parties on the border, without any protection and any proper medical supplies or services. They are suffering daily attacks. These are people who have already fled their homes and suffered heavily from the longstanding Syrian war. The legitimate right of Turkey to ensure the security of its borders cannot be, and should not be, accepted as an excuse for the escalation and continuation of a military operation that seems to be much wider than initially announced. Furthermore, the YPG (People’s Protection Unit) made a great contribution in the fight against Daesh. This is something we, including the Commission, already know, and portraying all its fighters as terrorists is more than just an oversimplification.  The military operation against the Kurdish majority enclave of Afrin risks jeopardising the peace talks in Geneva, which remain the only possible way forward for a sustainable and lasting peace in Syria. Thus, we urge Turkey to ensure the cessation of hostilities and to devote its efforts to bringing back peace to Syria, as I trust this is in its own interests.  Finally, we call for an immediate halt to any indiscriminate targeting of civilians and we urge all parties to strictly respect humanitarian law and to guarantee full access to humanitarian aid in the belligerent areas.

However, the measures taken, including the arrest of eight doctors last week when they called for peace after Turkish operations in Afrin, show that actions taken are often entirely unrelated to the failed coup and are certainly disproportionate.

The agreement signed in March 2016 requires Turkey to control illegal flows to Europe, in return for a huge envelope of €6 billion. It is the cowardice of our leaders that allowed Mr Erdogan to conclude this dupe deal, while continuing to demand accession to the European Union, for which he is already receiving a huge amount of money.

They must take example of what Bulgaria and Hungary are doing, which are giving themselves the means to effectively protect their borders, against the advice of the European Commissioners.

Between 2007 and 2013, Turkey received more European subsidies than Slovenia, which is a member of the Union. Led by an Islamist party, Turkey is not European by its history or by its geography, but by the ends of territories it has kept after centuries of conquests and bloody settlements over European peoples. A century after the terrible Armenian genocide, the Turks continue to bully and even oppress some Christian communities, which remain in this country in full Islamization. After decades of Kemalism, where the secular state had at least a concern for Christian heritage, the remains classified as UNESCO heritage are dropped into ruins, as in the former Armenian capital, Ani. This is what we denounce in one of the amendments tabled by our Group Europe of Nations and Freedoms. Therefore, if Turkey can indeed be a partner, it cannot under any circumstances become a member of the Union. It is time to make this clear to Mr Erdogan and put an end to the accession process as well as the totally unjustified financing that is currently being practiced.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 291, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Udo VOIGT", "mepid": "124832", "text": " Madam President!

The clarification of the failed coup, which is undoubtedly necessary, is increasingly a justification in Turkey for burying the rule of law, separation of powers, freedom of expression and human rights. Tens of thousands of men and women — teachers, judges, lawyers, academics, opposition politicians, mayors, soldiers, human rights activists — and also hundreds of young children have been imprisoned in Turkey for months and years. More journalists are detained in Turkey than in any other country. Mehmet Altan and Şahin Alpay remain incarcerated despite the fact that the Constitutional Court has condemned their detention as unlawful. Similarly, the chairman of the Amnesty Group in Turkey, Taner Kılıç, and the cases of Deniz Yücel or my friends Ahmet Şık, Osman Kavala and Selahattin Demirtaş show that international pressure to return to the rule of law has so far failed. I would therefore like to urge the European Court of Human Rights to finally negotiate and decide these cases of injustice without further embarrassing. Thinking of Turkey, I am often angry, but also sad. It is horrible to see how much democratic spirit, so much future for the country disappears behind prison walls.

There is a threat that the largest region of despots will be pushed into a new escalation.

It is not the first time that we have discussed this issue, and I fear that it will not be the last time, but it will not be helpful to show disagreement, which I personally share, with a sign that is most likely within the legal framework but which is unnecessarily provocative. As Federica Mogherini and I stated last week, we keep seeing more worrying developments undermining the rule of law and the independence and impartiality of the judiciary in Turkey. We are following the case of Amnesty International’s Taner Kılıç very closely. In particular, the non—implementation of judgments – including the recent constitutional court ruling and continued detention of two journalists – could really undermine the judiciary. In the short term, this affects the cases of individuals, including EU citizens. In the longer term, this could significantly erode trust in the judiciary as a whole, which also affects issues like Turkey’s business climate. We must seek concrete and lasting improvements in the area of the rule of law and fundamental freedoms. This is an essential footing for EU—Turkey relations.  Many of you here today also alluded to the situation in the south—east of Turkey, which remains of great concern. It is essential that a political process start again as there can only be a political solution to the Kurdish issue. Nevertheless, like some other speakers, I believe it is necessary to keep our channels of communication open. This includes raising our voice regarding the current worrying situation.

Everything we are doing as the European Union aims at a peaceful and democratic solution to all these different layers of the crisis, through credible and serious negotiations. As we speak, other efforts are ongoing to resume negotiations, and we can just hope that, this time, we will see some credibility and some concrete steps and openness in place. That has not been the case so far but it is never too late. When we last discussed Venezuela in this plenary, last September, we indicated four main areas where steps needed to be taken: an agreed calendar and conditions for credible elections; the facilitation of an emergency access plan for external assistance; the liberation of political prisoners; and respect for democratically elected institutions, notably the National Assembly. Unfortunately, progress was not made on any of these points. Throughout this period we have repeatedly engaged, all together as the European Union and together with our Member States, in a well-coordinated approach. In several meetings with our Venezuelan interlocutors we have discussed the need to respect democratic principles, democratic institutions, human rights and fundamental freedoms. We have called for serious engagement and flexibility in the ongoing negotiations to achieve a political agreement as a matter of urgency. Again, let me stress that talks are restarting, hopefully within hours. It was with a heavy heart that Member States decided to adopt targeted restrictive measures, in the absence of concrete results and in view of the constant deterioration of the situation. It is the first time that we have imposed measures of this kind in a Latin American context, and the decision was not taken lightly, as you can imagine. On 13 November, the Council adopted together targeted, gradual and reversible restrictive measures. These comprised a ban on the export of arms and equipment for internal repression, and a framework decision for a travel ban and assets freeze. Two months later, the Council recognised the lack of progress in the national dialogue and the worrying deterioration of the political and social situation in the country. As a consequence, the Council adopted a list of seven individuals subject to these measures. These targeted restrictive measures do not harm the people of Venezuela, but are directed at seven individuals who are responsible for undermining democratic principles and the rule of law and for human rights violations. Our measures are a signal to the authorities of Venezuela, an invitation to engage seriously towards a negotiated solution to the crisis and to reverse the moves that have called into question Venezuela’s constitutional order. We continue to monitor events on the ground and we stand ready to take appropriate measures in one way or another if the situation in the country evolves, with the constant aim of supporting democratic and negotiated solutions.  The recent decision of the Government of Venezuela to declare the Spanish Ambassador persona non grata is wrong and unacceptable, first and foremost because closing diplomatic channels does not help at a time when it is more important than ever to keep them open and seek a solution. We expect the Government of Venezuela to show genuine engagement in the negotiations and openness to compromise. We also hope that the opposition can work in a united and constructive manner. This is what the country needs in order to address the current challenges. Both parties should agree on a mutually acceptable date for the presidential elections. Unilateral decisions will only create more polarisation and new obstacles to a peaceful solution. It is also essential to set up guarantees to ensure free, transparent and credible elections. No artificial conditions should be imposed to limit the participation of political parties. The Supreme Court has decided to block the participation of Mesa de la Unidad Democrática in the elections, and clearly this goes against the goal of free, fair and inclusive elections. The people’s trust in elections can be regained only through a credible electoral process, with the lifting of bans on political opponents, with independent international observers and a balanced composition of the National Electoral Council. The future of Venezuela should be determined by its people. This is what we are asking of the Venezuelan authorities and all national political forces: the future of Venezuela should be determined by its people. We do not take sides in Venezuela’s domestic debate but we do ask for this debate to be democratic and inclusive, in line with the Constitution of the country. We see that the people of Venezuela are suffering, including the many European Union citizens who are also Venezuelan citizens. We have a stake in this. Everything we do is to encourage and support the country to come out of this political, economic and social crisis.  We are also concerned about the progressive deterioration of the social situation. The reports we are receiving from the United Nations agencies are extremely worrying. More than one million people are currently food insecure and the percentage of children affected by global acute malnutrition has reached emergency levels. The lack of medicines is estimated at around 90% by the National Chamber of Pharmacists. Diseases such as malaria and diphtheria that had disappeared are now spreading across the country. And there are no signs of recovery from the economic crisis. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), more than 1.5 million Venezuelans have already left the country. I want to reiterate that the repercussions in the region – on the fragile process in Colombia, on Brazil, on the regional organisations that are trying to move forward the regional integration process of Latin America and the Caribbean – are particularly worrying. The European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations department (DG ECHO) is present in Bogotá and deploys regular missions to Venezuela and bordering regions to evaluate the humanitarian situation, including the humanitarian conditions of the numerous Venezuelans who are fleeing the country to neighbouring countries. We are exploring all possibilities to develop our support, together with Member States and also with other donors and partner agencies. Let me stress once again that we will adapt our policies to any change in the situation in Venezuela, in one sense or the other. We need to see progress in the negotiations. I believe progress is still possible. It is a matter of political will. It is in the hands of the parties. As I mentioned, the Government has a clear responsibility to show flexibility and to engage seriously in these negotiations, and we hope to see real, concrete, encouraging steps.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 1, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 1, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 341, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA", "mepid": "2002", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr President, Madam High Representative, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament must once again raise its voice to denounce a new attempt at usurpation of national sovereignty by the convening of elections which do not meet the slightest democratic standards and which will only aggravate the dramatic political, economic, humanitarian and human rights situation in Venezuela. Yesterday the Venezuelan Penal Forum denounced mass arrests last week, among others that of the respected and prestigious politician Enrique Aristeguieta, 84. And yesterday four journalists had to leave the country again. It seems to me that the comment made by the US Secretary of State on his tour of Latin America is an absolutely pertinent reflection: can the world stand by while democracy is destroyed in Venezuela? Clearly, the sanctions adopted by the European Union have made a dent on the Government. The declaration of persona non grata and the expulsion of the Spanish ambassador demand, Madam High Representative, beyond solidarity and sympathies — which are welcome — a strong reaction from the European Union. Because an attack on a Member State is an attack on the Union as a whole. The European Parliament, in the resolution which is going to vote next Thursday, will call for the extension of the list of sanctioned persons to include those who are most responsible for serious human rights violations. But beyond sanctions, Madam High Representative, it is important for the European Union to mobilize with the international community, with the Lima Group and the regional actors to, as you said, pursue the Venezuelan people to speak again through a credible process, an inclusive process, a process without pitfalls, without disqualifications, with all political parties and with the community international.

The so-called Chavista revolution and the Maduro revolution have failed, to the point that half of the population is living in a very serious humanitarian crisis. What I regret most is that this so-called revolution is called socialist, because it is neither revolution nor socialist. For me, socialism is freedom. It's equality, but it's also freedom. And the third conviction I want to transfer to you. Beyond convictions, beyond sanctions, ladies and gentlemen, my group's conviction is that only a serious dialogue, a national agreement between the Government and the opposition will give a democratic and peaceful way out of Venezuela's democratic crisis. And I think it is important to claim, as Mrs Mogherini has rightly said, that we must give the people a voice — with guarantees, of course, with transparency and equality, but we must give the voice to the people.

While we are debating, Venezuelans have no food, no medicine, no freedom. They have no future and our duty is precisely to help them get it back. They, the Venezuelan people. The last time in Venezuela there were elections with a minimum of guarantees, the opposition won by thrashing. Since then, Maduro has manipulated, repressed and ignored the Constitution. Whoever defies him ends up disabled, exiled, imprisoned or killed. Because he's not interested in anything but power. That is why Europe cannot recognize fraudulent elections aimed at turning Venezuela into a one-party dictatorship, as in Cuba. We cannot recognize them when the regime has disabled almost all opposition leaders and their main alliance, when they are controlled by an electoral body that is the executing arm of the regime, a regime that has just executed Oscar Pérez, as it murdered many Venezuelans who went out to the streets in defense of their dignity. This call for presidential elections is a new mockery of the dialogue process that is taking place in the Dominican Republic, a process that is once again instrumentalized by Maduro to serve his sole interest: to perpetuate himself in power and preserve his corrupt network and that of his environment while the people suffer the consequences of his failed model. If the regime believed in dialogue, it would allow Venezuelans to express themselves in real elections: credible, transparent, free, inclusive, with international standards and independent observers who could ensure that they are a real election. I know that President Nicolás Maduro is interested in what we are discussing in this Parliament.

And this is the effort we are supporting with all the means we have and in constant contact with the regional players, because we have always invested in regional dynamics. This is particularly true for our Latin American partners, and that region is going to be at the same time more affected and hopefully also more influential. I say this with a deep respect for the institutional and political internal dynamics, but still recognising that what is happening there is not happening behind closed doors and concerns the international community. This concerns the European Union and this concerns many European Union citizens. Many of you have mentioned that European Union citizens that are suffering as a result of this crisis. So it is in our interest for a solution to be found. That can only be a political, negotiated solution in a peaceful and constitutional outcome of the crisis. I mention that a peaceful and constitutional outcome of the crisis is a key element because there could be a different outcome. And I think we have to be aware of the risks that a further deterioration of the situation could bring us. So we have mentioned the key elements that most of you have recalled today: credible elections, the release of all political prisoners, respect for democratically elected bodies, upholding of human rights and, very importantly, an alleviation of the suffering of the people of Venezuela. That would also imply a different trend in the fleeing of Venezuelans to neighbouring countries. That, as many of you recalled, might have a destabilising effect for different political situations in different countries that are also close to our hearts. We will continue to use all the different instruments we have, political support, diplomatic engagements, pressures, work with the international community and with the regional players, direct contacts with the opposition, but also with the authorities. And yes, we have had opportunities to pass very clear messages to the Venezuelan authorities, both locally and in Brussels, including messages that were very clear on our common position on the decisions that have been taken on the Spanish ambassador. I was very clear on that. Let me stress one thing – and I will close with this because I know we are running late – the unity of the European Union and its Member States is remarkable on this issue, maybe more than it is in this Chamber. But let me say, the work we have done both in Venezuela and in Brussels has shown unity of purpose, unity of action and coordinated efforts. I would like to thank the Member States for this, because this is what makes the difference when it comes to playing a role and making a difference, again with respect, with no interference.

It is timely and it is important. It is important first of all because millions of people – men, women and children – depend on the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for education, healthcare and social services, humanitarian assistance and employment. So, supporting UNWRA is a humanitarian duty and it is also in our collective interest for peace and security in the Middle East. I would like to mention a few reasons why it is essential to support UNWRA, its work and why the European Union not only is supporting it but is going to continue to support it and argue for continued or increased support from other international partners. Firstly, the work they do is crucial for the prospects of an agreement between Israel and Palestine. It is a key contribution that UNWRA is bringing to the prospect of relaunching a credible peace process, because a just, fair, agreed and realistic solution to the refugee question is one of the parameters of for peace negotiations, with the ultimate objective of achieving a two—state solution. The work that UNWRA does provides the political space towards achieving a peace deal and building a Palestinian State. Secondly, it is a matter of regional stability. This strikes me every time when international players don’t see the reality on the ground in the countries that have been hosting, for decades; a huge number of Palestinian refugees. Reducing the activities of UNWRA would cause instability and even security threats all around the region. This is true for the West Bank and Gaza, but this is also true for Lebanon and Jordan. They are themselves facing enormous challenges on other fronts and this is obvious to all of us I believe; there is no need for me to go into details about the huge pressure that both Lebanon and Jordan have been facing. Investing in UNWRA is also investing in our collective regional security. Thirdly, education. The European Union has always invested and will always continue to invest in the education of people and children to avoid any lost generation. For Palestinian kids, this means the possibility to keep hoping, to build their own future, and to believe in their own personal lives – which is no minor thing when you are a child; and it means also fighting radicalisation. So it’s also here an investment in our own security. Fourthly, UNWRA is particularly important for the political process in Gaza, where work is ongoing, efforts are ongoing for the return of the Palestinian Authority, and Palestinian reconciliation is essential for the prospect of a viable state of Palestine. So for all these reasons, we are – and we will continue to be – strong and reliable supporters of the work of UNWRA. Together with our Member States, we are doing all we can to avoid repercussions from the US decision to ensure that UNWRA can continue to operate and to ensure a continued engagement from all other international actors, but also from the United States. We have already increased our support in recent times. For 2018, the European Union will assist UNWRA by accelerating our first scheduled payment for this year, and I also count on donors around the world with whom we are in contact, including in coordination with other players. Here I would mention established partners for UNWRA, which already has important donors, but also all those that have so far been less engaged and who can step up their efforts in order to safeguard something that can be qualified as a global public good: the work that UNWRA does.  Peace between Israel and Palestine will clearly be built through negotiations, which requires a commitment from the two sides, but it must also be preserved every day on the ground and this is what UNWRA is doing with the Palestinian refugees. Investing in UNWRA is an interest we all share and the international community and the Palestinian refugees and the countries in the region can count on the European Union to continue to support its work.

The European Union is convinced that the two-state solution is the only possible answer if we want to achieve lasting peace in the Middle East. We believe that any solution to the Israeli—Arab conflict will need to include an agreed just and fair solution to the refugee question. The Palestinian refugee question has existed for almost 70 years. The United Nations General Assembly established and mandated UNRWA to provide assistance and protection to registered Palestinian refugees until a just and lasting solution is found to their plight. This is the work that UNRWA continues to do, laying the groundwork for future development through its work in education and health, and contributing – as the High Representative has just said – to security and stability in the region. The Commission will disburse our scheduled payment for 2018, which is about EUR 82 million, by the end of February – much earlier than originally planned. Some of our Member States have also announced plans to accelerate their contributions for this year and I can tell you that we will also do so in 2019 and 2020, at least, in order to reassure UNRWA from our side. It is still too early to tell you how exactly UNRWA will be affected since the scope and nature of the cuts in US funding are not entirely clear. What we do know is that the EU will not be able to compensate for substantial US cuts, given the pressure on available funds. We can and will actively assist UNRWA in reaching out to non—traditional donors in order to help the agency to broaden its donor base and, given the magnitude of the problem, we also need to work with host governments on how they might consider providing certain services that UNRWA cannot and maybe should not provide. UNRWA needs reform. Some of its financial problems are structural and predate the US decision. The EU has long been calling on UNRWA to review its operational and financial planning approach in order to safeguard its basic and essential core services, intended to help the most marginalised refugees. We therefore commend UNRWA’s commitment to a process of comprehensive financial reforms, including measures sustaining institutional change and increasing the cost-effectiveness of its programmes. But, in order to achieve improvements, we will work on this together with – and not against – the agency. There should be no doubt that the EU is and will remain a staunch and reliable supporter of UNRWA, both politically and financially. The EU and its Member States are by far the largest provider of assistance to Palestinian refugees – they provide around EUR 460 million a year. In June 2017, a joint declaration was signed between the EU and UNRWA as a framework for our financial and political support for the agency as further proof of our continued commitment, not just this year, but also in the years to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 367, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA", "mepid": "2002", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (ES) Mr President, Madam High Representative, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the United States Administration has decided to freeze a substantial part of the aid to the United Nations Agency for Palestine Refugees.

And this Parliament must clearly and unequivocally say that UNRWA has all our effective support. Our trust.

As UNRWA said, dignity was priceless. Instead, the Trump Administration's irresponsibility does, and it is a very high price. That is why I think we must act and we will defend and support the holding of an international conference with all actors, because all hands are necessary: the European Union, the Member States, the international community as a whole and also the Arab countries, which must fulfil their commitments.

We're talking about US President Trump's decision, which has not only affected just over half a million girls and boys in schools maintained by UNWRA in areas where Palestinian refugees live, but about the millions of Palestinians living in the harshest conditions in camps in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, the West Bank and Gaza. Because of the extreme distress into which the hard decision of the US government has plunged, it is our moral duty to come to the affected Palestinians and UNWRI for aid and try to make up for the income outage. Therefore, in the resolution to be decided tomorrow, we call for European Union countries to join solidarity action. Since back in 1950, when UNRWE's business first glassed, the United States has reliably and broadly supported its activity. It's probably not just a coincidence that the halving of funding for UNWRO directly followed the US president's announcement that he would formally recognize Jerusalem as the capital of the state of Israel. That announcement was followed by a statement by Palestinian President Abbas that he no longer sees the US as a possible intermediary in the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. To those who have had the opportunity to visit any Palestinian camp in the Middle East in the past years, it is clear that the work done by UNWRA is invaluable. While it is constantly faced with financial problems, and the number of aid needed is increasing, the organization not only maintains hope for a better refugee tomorrow, allows schooling children and comforting the elderly, through their self-sacrifice work and often, at the cost of their own sacrifice, keep it apolitical and neutral status of its organization and its institutions. Humanitarian aid is not a substitute for normal, man Worth a life. Such a life will only be allowed for Palestinian refugees once Israel and the Palestinians have permanently resolved their dispute with mutual respect and life in two sovereign states.

From this debate I conclude that we all join in a common call for support to UNRWA as an important stabilising factor in the region and an important element in ensuring the viability of the two-state solution.

We all are aware of what it means to lose one generation, or even several generations, if we fail to provide the necessary education and professional training and everything related to this. Such a failure might lead to radicalisation and other things which are definitely not in our, or the world’s, interests in future.

Nine million are the medical visits that this same agency finances in a year through 140 health centres, strewn across the devastated territories of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and Syria. Assistance nothing short of indispensable, which at a critical time like the current one, is cut by as much as 65 million dollars by its largest donor, the USA, just because it would lack that “respect” and” appreciation” to the administration's Trump led picks. A decision with tragic implications, both for innocent civilians whose survival depends on humanitarian aid, and for Europe itself. Extreme poverty, in fact, only increases the risk of radicalisation and multiply the migration flows of refugees to our countries. It is, therefore, with satisfaction that I welcome the new €42.5 million EU package to help the Palestinians in the construction of their future state, which can co-exist together with Israel's. Today more than ever there is a need for Europe to make a collective effort to raise UNRWA and ask Trump to reconsider his choice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 386, "date": "2018-02-06.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon WENTA", "mepid": "124903", "text": " in writing. — I have welcomed with great concern the decision of the current United States Administration to drastically reduce humanitarian aid funding for Palestinian refugees under UNRWA. According to President Trump's announcement in 2018, the US intends to donate $65m to the agency instead of the planned 125m. Aid provided by the agency is crucial to the survival of more than 5 million Palestinians, including women and children, to whom UNRWA provides food, drinking water, shelter, medical care and education. Depriving the agency of financial resources is tantamount to taking away those persons from the right to said benefits. I appeal to the American administration to reconsider the decision to cut funding for UNRWA, mindful of the fate of those to whom it ensures daily survival and dignified living conditions. As a last resort, I propose replacing the withdrawn funds with other programs for the benefit of the Palestinians, or at least spreading the planned reduction over time so that the international community can take appropriate compensatory action. At the same time, I ask the European Union and the Member States to coordinate efforts to fill the UNRWA budget gap so as to maintain the continuity of humanitarian aid provided to Palestinian refugees.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}]
