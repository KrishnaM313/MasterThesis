The current report is already the thirty-second of its kind. I had the honour to be the rapporteur for the 2014 report. We can soon discuss the key findings and conclusions, but before that let us think for a moment why these reports are made.  The European Union was founded to promote peace, democracy and the rule of law. Its purpose is to establish an internal market with a highly competitive social market economy and a high level of environmental protection. This all contributes to the well-being of all Europeans. If we want to meet these objectives, the EU and its Member States must not only make laws, but also implement and apply them. In 2014, environment, health, consumer protection, mobility and transport were again the policy areas with the highest number of new infringement cases. These are policy areas directly linked to the well-being of citizens and to the functioning of the internal market.  When it comes to monitoring the application of Union law, different institutions have different tasks. First and foremost, the responsibility for the correct application of EU law belongs to the Member States. The Commission is responsible for the monitoring and, if needed, the enforcement. Finally, this Parliament has a crucial role in exercising the political oversight of the Commission’s enforcement actions.  What are the key findings, then, of our political oversight this year? Firstly, the enforcement of EU law is not sufficiently transparent. The structured dialogue with Member States via the so-called ‘EU pilot system’ seems to have promoted the more efficient enforcement of EU law but, if Parliament and if other interested parties are kept in the dark, it will certainly generate problems in the future. We must ensure the utmost transparency.  Secondly, the EU legal system and its fundamental values, such as the rule of law and respect for human rights, can be a vital tool in tackling many of the problems the accession countries and the countries with association agreements are facing. Therefore, in order to provide suitable assistance to carry out necessary legal and judicial reforms, we need more systematic tools to assess the current state of compliance with the relevant EU acquis in these countries.  Thirdly, we could benefit from a more systematic approach here in the EU, too. This year, the Committee on Legal Affairs received opinions from three other committees – and I want to thank all these committees: Economic and Monetary Affairs, Employment and Social Affairs, and Petitions, for their contributions – but perhaps we could further improve our internal procedures so that in future the relevant committees could make even more precise act- and country-specific observations from their field of competence. All in all, the credibility of the EU institutions does not lie only in the quality of our legislation, but also in its correct implementation and application. Therefore, I ask the Commission and the Council to pay close attention both to this report and to the speeches and comments of my colleagues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, the European Union is founded on law and relies on law to ensure that its policies and priorities are realised in the Member States. The effective application, implementation and enforcement of the law is hence a high political priority for this Commission. Often, it is not the lack of EU legislation that is the source of problems; it is rather the lack of its effective application and redress for citizens. That is why the European Commission takes its role as Guardian of the Treaties so seriously. If Member States are breaching EU law, then we need to take steps to address this weakness and, where necessary, we may need to launch formal infringement proceedings before the European Court of Justice. This unique and essential role of the Commission, overseeing the effective and efficient application of Union law in the Member States, is an integral part of the Better Regulation agenda. Through the annual reports on monitoring the application of EU law, the Commission reports on its work and explains how it exercises its powers as Guardian of the Treaties. I want to thank Members for the preparatory work on the 2014 Annual Report. The Commission very much appreciates Parliament’s increased interest in implementation issues. The Annual Report reviews the Member States’ performance on key aspects of the application of Union law from the point of detection of a possible infringement to the pursuit of the case before the Court. We detect problems in the application of law ourselves, but we also rely on petitions and complaints from citizens and business. Hence your Petitions Committee plays an important role. Once we have identified a problem we can work with Member States to solve it through a system called the EU Pilot. If the problem cannot be solved we indicate infringement procedures. The Treaty allows us to request financial fines if Member States are late in transposition and we have not hesitated to do so.  Let me summarise the main findings of the 2014 Report. Citizens and businesses remain active in detecting and bringing forward violations of EU law. More than 3 500 complaints were received from citizens and businesses during the year 2014. We are determined to work with the Member States in improving compliance at an early stage and resolving potential infringements quickly, to the benefit of citizens and businesses. About 75% of alleged infringements were resolved at an early stage. As a result, the overall number of formal infringement procedures has continued to decrease. However, there is still a significant gap between what is in the EU rulebook and the rules applied on the ground.  How can we improve the implementation of EU law more generally? I strongly believe that we should strengthen our partnership with the Member States and support them in their task of timely transposition and correct application of the law. As part of our better regulation efforts, we deploy a wide array of tools, ranging from preventive measures and early problem solving to proactive monitoring and targeted enforcement.  You have raised a number of other issues in the Hautala report, to which I would like to respond. I note your increased interest as regards Parliament’s role in monitoring the implementation of EU law. Without prejudice to democratic control by Parliament, the Commission oversees the application of EU law under the control of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The infringement procedure has a specific bilateral nature. It is conducted solely between the Commission and the concerned Member State. This being said, the Commission will continue to provide Parliament with information on infringement proceedings in accordance with its commitments in the current Framework Agreement. This includes more detailed information, if requested, on specific infringement cases. As regards Parliament’s proactive contribution in monitoring the compliance with EU law of accession countries and countries with association agreements, I want to emphasise that the Commission will continue its regular reporting on the progress made by these countries.  I note your call for a legislative proposal on administrative procedures under Article 298 of the Treaty. I would like to stress that the Commission has already created a strong framework to protect complainants. Its Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and the Communication on relations with the complainant offer a number of guarantees that safeguard complainants’ rights throughout the entire procedure. These include the right to be informed about any decision on his or her complaint, the right to be heard, prior notice before closing a case, and a timeframe for a final decision on complaints. Against this background, the Commission does not find it necessary to regulate this matter in a legislative act based on Article 298 of the Treaty.  Concerning the transparency of infringement procedures, and especially that of EU Pilot, the Commission is fully dedicated to delivering on the commitments stipulated in the Framework Agreement. I wish to underline that from the initial phase of infringement procedures, the Commission must also respect confidentiality vis-à-vis the Member States, as recognised by the Court of Justice. This means that transparency and access to a specific file has to be limited while the Commission conducts its initial investigation in order to clarify the often complex legal and factual background of the cases. I also note your increased interest in better regulation. Our aim is to legislate in an open, transparent way, using the best evidence available and valuable stakeholder inputs. We also focus on ways to support implementation and are pleased to see that Parliament supports all these efforts.

Since 2009 there have been 1 000 procedures per year. This is the real sickness of the EU project. This is what is killing the EU and creating political disaffection everywhere: the inability of the EU to maintain the rule of law within its Member States. Poland and Hungary do not want to accept refugees, Italy does not want to apply European rules to solve the banking crisis, France is allowed not to comply with the public deficit rules because it is France – as President Juncker, incredibly, stated publicly – and Spain does not comply with the Late Payment Directive. Spain is unwilling to force the big Spanish multinationals to pay SMEs’ bills at 30 days and allows them to pay at 250 days without sanction. In Spain one million workers of sovereign SMEs lost their jobs during the crisis due to these bad practices on the part of big multinationals allowed by the central government. So, in my opinion, bad transposition of EU law, is the silent crisis of the European project. Countries in the south of Europe, which are the worst offenders regarding EU law, are the countries which most need to implement it to modernise their economy. So, finally, if Europe is not able to oblige Member States to comply with EU law, citizens will abandon all hope in the European project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Agnieszka KOZŁOWSKA", "mepid": "124889", "text": "  author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by The opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on this report has been drafted in full agreement, with a high convergence of positions, and draws attention to the fact that delays and irregularities in transposition constitute a barrier to the internal market and are contrary to the interests of citizens: both employers and workers. Therefore, work should be made to reduce these delays. This reduction and improvement can be achieved by analysing the causes of delays, as well as by working with countries and social partners, exchanging information and good practices. In this context, the Committee welcomes the effectiveness of EU Pilot action, as well as the introduction of websites informing it, with the entire database of infringements, and informing on the application of Union law.  The Commission draws attention to the need to constantly review existing legislation with regard to the principle of subsidiarity, as over-regulation can harm employers and the labour market.

It would seem that, after so many years of Community existence, the process of monitoring the implementation of Community law in the legal systems of the Member States is a routine issue, that this is just something that we must do for the sake of order. The reality, however, is that it is completely different. There are several reasons, but the most important one is that the Member States are still so mistrustful of what we, together with the European Council, are creating at Community level. This mistrust of whether this approach linked to such a system of additional control results in completely unnecessary national rules being imposed on those created at European Union level. Informing citizens, on the other hand, is that it is these bad officials and this Parliament with the Council somewhere in Brussels that are creating the law that we have to deal with now, and you are, unfortunately, the people who are most affected by this.  I am strongly protesting on this issue. We are trying, together with the Council, to make it transparent and, above all, necessary and effective for our citizens and for businesses, because it is intended to make their lives easier. That is why we are implementing national parliaments in the legislative process at an early stage of the legislative process, in order to avoid confusion or a desire for such or other approaches to established Community law. I am therefore very pleased that the European Commission is serious about monitoring the law and pointing out those shortcomings that are being flagled by both citizens and businesses.

As an MEP, but also as a professor of European Union institutions at the University of Crete, I consider it important that recently the Court of Justice of the European Union, on the occasion of the Cyprus Memorandum, stressed that the Union institutions, when acting as members of the troika, are bound by the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

A number of things that need to be addressed here are involved. We cannot talk about EU law, but rather European Union law.  In a rule of law it is the courts that carry out the law and the law is only one of the sources of law. It is imperative, in this area, to intensify cooperation, on the one hand, between the different bodies of the Union - namely the Commission, Parliament and the Council - and, on the other hand, between these bodies and each of the Member States.  Realising the law through the application of laws means fairly resolving social life disputes, especially those affecting the lives of people, businesses and other associations between them and between them and the EU and the Member States.  The rule of law is precisely the State which is limited in its concrete actions by the rules and principles of law. It is therefore urgent to create reserves of jurisdiction for the European Union, especially in matters relating to the single market and human rights, as well as the establishment of Union courts in each Member State. European integration will be nothing more than a mirage until concrete steps are taken in standardising the different laws and jurisdictions in Europe. There is therefore an urgent need for greater integration in the area of justice, even as a factor in overcoming many of the current blockades and even deepening European cohesion itself. Without democratic reforms in the justice systems of the Union and the Member States there will be no real European integration.

All this gives us the opportunity to reflect, which should, of course, affect all the institutions of the European Union, on the reasons for this behaviour. Perhaps the Commission has regulated most aspects of the lives of European citizens. On the contrary, it is preferred not to intervene on issues that are likely to lead to the emergence and, in some cases, to further aggravate the differences between the Member States. I believe that there are still many questions on which the citizens of Europe are waiting for answers. I am thinking in particular of legislation to combat corruption and organised crime, but also of whistleblower protection or transparency legislation.  Finally, I have some misgivings about the fact that financial penalties could be a real deterrent to the fight against infringements, as they would ultimately fall on the taxpayers' shoulders.

This Parliament and the Commission are always quick to establish themselves as whipping fathers to the Member States who would behave as bad pupils in the face of the Brussels doxa. I call on the Commission to lead by example and to make the compliance of its actions with the treaties a real priority, starting with the application and respect of the principle of subsidiarity provided for by Article 5 of the Treaty on European Union. The Commission ignores this and does not respect the obligation to motivate draft legislation under Protocol 2. However, the Member States, in their Edinburgh Declaration in 1992, affirmed that the European Union is based on subsidiarity, and have even enshrined it as a fundamental principle.  On the other hand, this report dares to assert that unjustified Euroscepticism is due to unnecessary measures \"taken by Member States during the application of EU legislation\". So you wouldn't be responsible for anything? Irresponsible mass unemployment and job destruction across Europe. Irresponsible of the migration submersion, which you have organised, and whose distribution you impose on peoples who can no longer and do not want it, as the Hungarian referendum showed us.  Your policies are irresponsible. You do not need anyone to provoke the discontent and anger of the peoples, but to give moral lessons, you are always the first, like the Luxembourg Foreign Minister, who called for the exclusion of Hungary because it would not respect the values of the Union.

Unfortunately, the EU is much less precise on the big things. In 2014, the so-called euro bailout also massively broke laws. For example, €8.3 billion of European ESFS funds were transferred to Greece in 2014.  The ESFS is one of the instruments of the European Union. The allocation of these funds was linked by the Eurogroup at that time to the promise of Greece's debt sustainability. Today, we know that the IMF is officially denying this debt sustainability and is demanding a debt cut. We found before 2014 that Greek debt was unsustainable, and the Eurogroup must also have been aware of this.

Another example: labour regulations. You are cheerfully involved in the framework of work, for example in Spanish; two reforms have been imposed, but while you are making cuts and others implement them, you forget that European legislation is also based on the principle of non-discrimination, and it has to be the Court of Justice of the European Union that intervenes to recognise rights to temporary and interim workers.

In fact, the pilot project of that dialogue has made many procedures not reach the infringement dossier, and we think that is good news.  It is true that almost all infringements concern services, the environment, transport and everything that would be development, but it is no less true that, if we put all efforts on the part of all actors — the Member States too, making the transpositions of the directives in a timely and form, and we also put in time for transpositions that are really objective— , we will get citizens to truly trust in the European institutions, and that distance between what we do in the institutions and what citizens receive is shortened, and they believe much more in us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 23, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Lidia Joanna GERINGER DE OEDENBERG", "mepid": "28377", "text": "   – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab In 2014, the European Commission received 3 715 complaints of alleged infringements of EU law and launched 893 new infringement procedures.

Our goal is to ensure the timely – and I want to emphasise also what Mr Polčák has just said –application of EU law in the Member States. Not only that, this is also about the way we work, the methods we use, and about the cooperation of the Commission with the European Parliament and the Member States.  Although I would say the rules are very rigid, the message must be flexible, because we need to take the relevant approach to the cases which we work with. I can share with you one example: I am responsible for the integration of people in societies, for the very sensitive issue of the integration of Roma children into normal basic education, and we have three countries where we already have EU Pilot. For me, this is absolutely essential that I see the results in concrete time. The procedure itself, for me, is important and it exists, but I prefer to start EU Pilot and continuous dialogue and push the Member States. And I would emphasise the dialogue more than the push, because it is also in the interests of the Member States to change the situation. For me, reaching the next stage of the procedure is not as important as achieving the necessary results, which means that more people from Roma communities will have good quality education.  This debate is also very much connected to the Better Regulation system, which the Commission now has, meaning less new legislation, but more stress on the real application of EU law, and also more understanding of how the application of EU law works in practice. This has not been debated here at all, this effect, which gives us a chance to see better how it works in practice, and what should be corrected – because not everything which was adopted in the past is still valid and relevant for current problems. You know that we have review clauses in the EU legislation, so we must use this interaction to take the proper measures to adopt and to modify the legislation so that it better meets the needs of the 21st Century. In the digital agenda this is typical. We need to be able to have this interaction, and to understand what works, what poses big burdens on businesses and people. We must not only say that we want to cut red tape; we must do it. We must deregulate things which people across the EU are saying is making their lives more difficult and, of course, continue to check how it is with the gold-plating in the Member States. In many cases, the Member States say that Brussels gave us the legislation but in the end we see that it was the Member State which made it more difficult for the people. So this is about a method, it is about our contact with reality and the full understanding that we are here to improve the legislation and to improve the lives of people, to increase legal certainty and to contribute to increased trust.  Believe me, Mr Lebreton, who accused us of disregarding the interests of people (he is not here anymore but I would like to address him), when I became the Commissioner responsible for Justice I received hundreds of mails from people who complained about their situation and they shared with me their frustration that there is no justice for them in the EU and in their State. Maybe among the people sitting here watching us there is also such a frustration, perhaps they are not satisfied with the situation, that perhaps justice is here only for the rich or the young, and I can tell you that I read all the mails and I responded to all of them. The majority were individual cases where people were frustrated about the result of some poor decision, but many mails reflected the mistakes of the system and also the lack of application of EU law in their Member State. I found these mails alarming and we worked with them. For me this was a very important hint and impulse for the beginning of my work here, and I am sure all my colleagues experienced the same thing and we tried to work with all the complaints, be it from the European Parliament, from the Committee on Petitions, or be it directly from the citizens of the EU and of the Member States. This must be done on a continuous basis and I think this is our common goal. Thank you for this debate. I can assure you on behalf of the Commission that we have very high interest in continuing good cooperation with Parliament on better regulation and the better application of EU law.

I would like to address a couple of them that were raised in the discussion and also in in your words, Commissioner Jourová. First, I must say that I am – and I believe my colleagues are as well – disappointed that the Commission continues to dismiss the demand by Parliament to introduce a more open, efficient and independent EU administration on the grounds of Article 298 in the Treaties, because it seems that the Commission believes that this is an attack against it. It is not. It is also a reminder that the Commission is responsible for how the EU administration works in the bodies, offices and agencies of the Union, of which there are so many. How can you be so sure that the administration is open, efficient and independent in all those tens of different institutions? Secondly, I would like to say that it is very important that we continue to open up what better regulation means. I would like to touch on the aspect of prevention. Last Friday, I organised a seminar in my home city of Helsinki with experts from consumer law authorities, consumer associations, trade associations and others. I must say that, when the subject is the digital agenda, under new proposals by the Commission on contracts on the purchase of digital content and tangible goods, many of these stakeholders and authorities complained about the complexity and the way in which these new proposals add to complexity. This means that it will be very difficult to apply this type of legislation properly.  I think there is no easy way out, but we need to work together and I hope that that in the next year the Parliament, when giving the answer to the Commission’s next report, will have a more structured cooperation. We also missed opinions from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and the Committee on Transport and Tourism, having seen that these are the areas where most of the infringements actually occur.

The report also highlights the decrease in the number of formal infringement procedures over the last five years. It should be stressed that the correct implementation and application of EU law are primarily the responsibility of the Member States and that the Member States must also respect all fundamental values and rights enshrined in the Treaties and in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights when implementing EU law. At the same time, Parliament recalls that the Commission has a responsibility to monitor and evaluate the implementation of EU law and therefore constantly encourages Member States to use correlation tables on a regular basis, but notes that this does not relieve the EU institutions of their obligation to respect EU primary law when drafting secondary EU legislation.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, as in 2013, the ALDE Group has decided not to co-signed the emergency resolution on Mrs Victoire Ingabire, President of the FDU-Inkingi. I quite agree with Mrs Arena when she says that we should have worked on a resolution directly affecting the functioning of democracy in Rwanda, rather than isolating a case that is indisputably ambiguous.  That is why we are not going to follow this resolution. The resolution is too ambiguous, confusing, expresses unverifiable accusations, claiming that Ms. Victoire Ingabire was convicted without evidence and, therefore, for political reasons.  I took the trouble to meet with the D.A. who handled this matter. I, of course, asked all the questions that related to the statements I had heard and that had been expressed. Not a single one of these questions can be answered by the prosecutor. I would also like to point out that, 22 years after an abominable genocide, it is understandable that the authorities are afraid of allowing ethnic quarrels to spread again. However, everyone knows that Ms. Ingabire has contacts with the Interahamwe FDLR, which are the genocidals of 1994. That has to be said, too.  Together with Guy Verhofstadt, I witnessed the immense courage of the Rwandan people in a drama that appears in the most sordid gallery of abominations in history. Rwanda is recovering thanks to the will of the Rwandan authorities and, above all, the Rwandan people to pull their country up. I just want to point out that the Rwandan parliament has 51 women out of 80 in the Chamber of Deputies, or 63.8%, 10 out of 26 women in the senate, or 30.5%. It is ranked at this level in the world leading position. The Women in Parliaments Global Forum, chaired by Silvana Koch-Mehrin, our former colleague, will open an office in Kigali soon.  Rwanda has 11 out of 28 women in government, or 40%. The death penalty is abolished there. Sexual orientation is respected. This too must be said! I know, of course, that human rights must be better respected, that we must work on them, that we must push the authorities to do so, of course.

The refusal of the Rwandan authorities to hold the long-planned meeting of the European Parliament's mission with the activist Victoire Ingabire must not go unnoticed.

As you are aware, and many of you have said so, Ms Victoire Ingabire was sentenced in October 2012 to eight years in prison, having been arrested and detained on several charges, and her sentence was then extended to 15 years by the Supreme Court of Rwanda in December 2013, following appeals by both prosecution and defence. We in the Commission, and the High Representative, are of course very much aware of the fact that the European Parliament has already passed a resolution on the case of Victoire Ingabire and that members of the Committee on Women’s Rights (FEMM) requested a prison visit during your visit to Kigali and that request was rejected by the Rwandan authorities.  The European Union, both the EEAS and individual EU Member States, have followed closely the situation of Ms Ingabire since her arrival in Rwanda in 2010 to run for president, and this period has included her detention, her hearings and her imprisonment since then. The court cases where observed by members of the EU diplomatic community, as well as a lawyer commissioned by the Netherlands to analyse the trial.  As you know, Ms Ingabire has filed an appeal with the African Union Court of Human and People’s Rights where her case is pending, despite the recent decision of Rwanda to withdraw from a special declaration that allows for the deposition of individual cases against the Rwandan authorities. The EU will continue to follow closely the process and the outcome of this appeal, which we hope will be allowed to run its course, and here I do note the concern of the House and the resolution that the appeal should be prompt and fair. Conditions of detention are a matter of concern. We insist that Ms Ingabire receive fair treatment in a prison facility, and that she continues to be regularly visited by members of her political party, as well as representatives of the EU diplomatic community. This is not only an issue of comfort; it is important that she should feel safe in prison and that she has access to the medicines she needs and access to legal advice.  In the Ingabire case, the EU insists that due legal process be followed, that international obligations are respected and that all the rights of the defendant, including in appeals, are fully ensured. Overall, we maintain a continuous political dialogue with Rwanda on a number of issues, including justice.  Rwanda has a managed a remarkable transformation, not only in economic reforms, but also in the area of representation of women in parliament and also in the governance of the country. These are important achievements. Let there be no mistake, we have a lot to learn here, but this should not stop us from speaking frankly with our partners on the issues that are of concern. The link between justice and political space is especially sensitive and we do have concerns which we have expressed to our Rwandan partners on the judicial treatment of some opposition actors.  At the same time, we also note that several international bodies have concluded that trials in the country are generally consistent with internationally recognised fair trial standards, and I am glad that in the draft resolution here you have expressed your respect for the independence of Rwanda’s judicial system.  We will from the EU and the Member States continue to engage with the Rwandan authorities over the rule of law and further reform of the justice system in the country, as well as reform of the legal framework as to encourage widening of political space, development of a legitimate political opposition, and full exercise of political rights in the country, including freedom of speech and association.

Serious human rights violations have been perpetrated by state actors, government—supported militia and rebel forces in impunity. These happened with serious disregard for Sudan’s interim constitutions of 2005, international commitments or recommendations presented by the Human Rights Council. International and local civil society organisations in Sudan face severe obstructions in their work, in particular those working on human rights issues and in conflict-affected areas. One of these organisations is the one you referred to, TRACKs, a human rights organisation which provides and facilitates training on a variety of topics, ranging from human rights to information technology. Currently ten members or affiliates of the TRACKs staff, including its Director, Khalafalla Alafif Mukhtar, who has been in detention since May, are facing trial in two separate cases under Sudan’s criminal court and these carry – as you also mentioned – the death penalty.  The EU considers that the repeated official raids and summoning of staff on judicial charges are in violation of freedom of expression and association and appear to be a clear attempt to intimidate the members of the organisations due to their work on human rights or democratisation. Accordingly, we have closely followed developments on the TRACKs case and we have observed several court sessions. It is coordinating with the different EU Member States and other Western embassies on the ground to ensure a continuous international presence throughout the trials on a rotation basis. This case is, of course, also continuously raised in meetings with Sudanese officials. Overall, promoting a conducive environment for civil society and the protection of human right defenders are key issues in EU relations with Sudan. We have the EU country map for engagement of civil society and the human rights and democracy strategy for Sudan. However, UN agencies and humanitarian partners keep being denied access to so many areas in Darfur, in South Kordofan and Blue Nile by government authorities, preventing the delivery of assistance which is so needed to the vulnerable population. We have, in the EU, been at the forefront of calling for a speedy agreement on cessation of hostilities, humanitarian taxes and an inclusive, comprehensive and transparent national dialogue process in a conducive environment. Efforts towards peace and human rights remain a priority for the EU. The EU, in particular through our Special Representative for the Horn of Africa, Mr Alexander Rondos, supports efforts towards a holistic and inclusive political solution. Political and financial support was provided to the mediation efforts led by President Mbeki, in the framework of the African Union High-Level Implementation Panel for Sudan and South Sudan. We consider that the gravity of the human rights situation requires continued attention from the UNHCR and therefore we have supported the extension of the mandate of the independent experts on Sudan, while pushing strongly for his full access to all areas of the country.  Our commitments to enhance cooperation with African countries on migration is firmly anchored within international humanitarian law and international human rights law, and EU assistance to Sudan is delivered at bilateral and regional levels through international organisations and NGOs, not through that Sudanese Government. No support has ever been given to the rapid support forces, and we are aware of the specific situation of the Christian minorities and are looking into that. There have recently been some arrests of pastors and we are following those cases on the ground as well. The EU will continue to call for the government to respect freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and the media, to release the detainees and to give them an opportunity for fair trial and to conduct credible investigations into human rights violations that led to killing, injuries and material damage. I am sure this is not going to be the last time we discuss the terrible situation in Sudan.

Gentlemen, this is a disgrace. As is the human rights situation in Thailand. In this regard, Human Rights Watch notes that the human rights and labour rights of migrant workers, especially from Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos, are violated with impunity on a regular and permitted basis.

Today, however, this is not so. Mr Andy Hall is present and has been in Parliament as my guest, meeting many colleagues and other EU actors. He was deemed guilty of criminal defamation under Article 328 of the Thai Criminal Code and crimes under Article 14(1) of the Computer Crimes Act. The charges were brought against him by Natural Food Company Limited, a Thai pineapple producer, because of a report called ‘Cheap has a high price’, which was published by a Finnish NGO, Finnwatch. Mr Hall had done research for the report which revealed serious violations of workers’ rights in Natural Food’s operations. The report’s aim was to investigate possible problems in Finnish retail companies’ supply chains and these violations were found. To respect the court’s decision does not mean that we should agree with it. Today the European Parliament will show that we disagree with the Bangkok criminal court.  I have been following Andy Hall’s case for several years now and I will continue to express my support for him, among many other colleagues who are deeply touched by what happened to him. Instead of being prosecuted and convicted, Andy Hall should be given an award for his work as a human rights defender. The use of criminal defamation laws, carrying penalties of imprisonment against human rights defenders, constitutes a violation of Thailand’s obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which it is a state party.  Thailand has recently made some progress in the work against labour exploitation. It has, for example, ratified ILO Convention 187 on Promotional Framework for Occupational Safety and Health. Still, Thailand should abolish the crime of defamation and it needs to revise the Computer Crime Act, which is very broadly worded. I am very concerned about what implications Mr Hall’s sentence will have on people and organisations working to improve the human rights situation in Thailand. The court decision is a clear step back on freedom of expression that might lead to further silencing of human rights defenders in Thailand.  Corporate social responsibility is the cornerstone for improving the human rights situation all over the world. Transparency and responsible business conduct is today’s thinking.

Mr Hall is present with us today and I welcome his presence.  The case was brought against him by a Thai food processing company for his contribution to a report by the European NGO, Finnwatch, which alleged serious labour rights abuses by the company concerned. This verdict sends shivers through Thailand’s already nervous human rights and social rights community. Criminal defamation laws are often used improperly by various actors to silence analysis and debate. Mr Hall’s reaction, that he was grateful for the international attention the case has brought to migrant rights in Thailand, testifies to his character in a way that the verdict does not because this is, of course, a much bigger question than one person. It is not my role to criticise a court, but let me mention what the ILO country director said, and I quote, ‘Labour rights abuses suffered by migrants in Thailand have been well documented in various ILO reports. The treatment alleged in the Finnwatch report is not unique to any one employer or industry’. This verdict casts a deep shadow over the real progress in Thailand in recent months regarding labour conditions. Let me mention, for instance, the prohibition of child labour in the seafood sector, the reinforcement of the labour inspection, the new legislation for labour agencies, measures to prevent debt bondage and trafficking in human beings, more deterrent sanctions schemes on labour abuses and the decision to ratify several ILO conventions. This would, of course, not have been possible without political will and dedicated Thai officials, without our dialogue with them, and without the cooperation of the ILO. The EU has several projects in Thailand, together with the ILO, on the issue of migrant workers and labour conditions. The progress made is good and we expect it to continue. We hope that the abuses and the type of abuses which Mr Hall has documented will soon no longer be found in Thai factories. Respecting human rights is important, but it is also good business. Companies in Thailand and everywhere in the world who want to send to the EU need to understand that European consumers demand products free of labour abuse. I say to them that they should not underestimate the fundamental decency of the European consumer during her or his daily shopping. Do not underestimate the EU’s – and the increasingly global –determination in ensuring decent work in global supply chains and more transparency. This is indeed an issue we are working on with companies to see if we can formulate a more coherent corporate social responsibility strategy that we are working on within the Commission. Mr Hall, Finnwatch, Thai workers, migrant workers in Thailand and Thai officials working on labour rights all deserve our continued support and the closest possible cooperation to accelerate the process which is still so necessary.

IFRS 9 – Financial Instruments were issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) as a key response to the financial crisis and its impact on the banking sector. I supported this motion for a resolution as it thoroughly notes the absence of a proper quantitative impact assessment for IFRS 9, which is due in part to a lack of reliable data.

IFRS 9 represents a major change in the process of measuring impairment losses of institutions and emerges as a response of the Council of International Accounting Standards to the late recognition of losses in the ias 39 loss model. IFRS 9 is based on a foresight view through an expected loss model, which makes institutions able to recognize losses before they occur.  The change of approach forces financial institutions to model future market trends, which will require an important set of macroeconomic data that historically have not been required for accounting purposes. Although it contains some concerns, the resolution does not call into question the process of setting the standard.

This accounting standard is at odds with the \"historical cost valuation\" standard, which values assets and liabilities on their market date.

I voted in favour of the resolution because, from a human point of view, I have no reason to oppose it. More than one wonders what the adoption of the resolution will change in the first. Not much, I'm afraid. The recent attacks on hospitals and humanitarian aid convoys are undoubtedly worthy of any condemnation, as this is a grave violation of international humanitarian law and a war crime. Russia and the Assad regime must immediately stop attacks on civilians and infrastructure, and the siege of cities must end.

In these, the EU is represented only by the current Presidency and the Commission, i.e. uneased representatives, which has long been criticised by Parliament.

This means that public budgets practically take less money from CO2 emitters than they have to spend to repair the damage they cause. The report argues that the price of an allowance below EUR 30/tonne is wholly inadequate, implying that the current system is absolutely failing.

On the other hand, the resolution welcomes the commitment of all countries to keep the increase in global average temperature below 2oC relative to pre-industrial levels and to continue efforts to limit temperature rise to 1.5oC.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 4, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 504, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Antonio LÓPEZ-ISTÚRIZ WHITE", "mepid": "28399", "text": "  in writing.

This report deals with food contact materials, which mainly means food packaging (but can also refer to food utensils or factories where food is made), and EU regulation or lack thereof covering these products. Currently only 4 out of 17 of the FCMs identified for measures are actually regulated, which means there is are a lot of packaging substances, e.g. printing ink, paper, metal, adhesives and varnishes, which are not covered. There is increasing concern regarding the migration of chemicals from food contact materials into the food we eat.

In the light of the data, preparations for the Regulation have been started, identifying four main areas: risk assessment, traceability and compliance enforcement and monitoring. Risk assessment of harmonised substances is a matter for the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), but there are no adequate financial resources to do so. It is therefore proposed to finance these EFSA activities. However, for non-harmonised substances, EFSA is not competent. This is why a single set of rules is needed, to which those involved in the field can ass themselves.

The plastics themselves are generally completely harmless biologically, but can release the BPA they contain to food. BPA is known to have a negative effect similar to the female sex hormone estrogen. However, what the rapporteur has concealed in his very detailed report is the reassessment carried out by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) in January 2015. EFSA's findings show that the amount of BPA that the consumer is exposed to is well below the safe limit, even with combined contact with both food and cosmetics. According to EFSA 2015, BPA does not pose a health risk to any age group. The strong regulation of the economically relevant BPA cannot therefore be proven from a scientific perspective.

Controls to be carried out by states under the Regulation on official controls on food and feed are rarely regular. Control practices vary across EU Member States and the documentation that comes with this control is often unavailable or incomplete.  In order to ensure effective oversight of FCMs within the EU, risk assessment gaps need to be filled, materials in every part of the supply chain should be followed and controls should be carried out successfully. The current framework of measures needs to be adapted to better achieve the objectives of preserving and protecting consumer health and better efficiency of the existing internal food market.  As a result of the forthcoming claims, I have supported this report, as I believe that standards for product safety features in the EU must ensure and protect consumer health and facilitate controls in the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 691, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Andrejs MAMIKINS", "mepid": "124746", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I support report author’s suggestion to continue with further scientific research into non-intentionally added substances as, in contrast to known hazardous substances, their identity and structure, especially in plastics, are often unknown and extend the concept of vulnerable groups to pregnant and breastfeeding women and to include the potential effects of low-dose exposure and non-monotonic dose responses in the risk assessment criteria.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 692, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Vladimír MAŇKA", "mepid": "28192", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 Food security is a fundamental human right.

In 2014, more than 600 complaints were received and more than 160 infringement cases were opened in this area. Of course, not all of them need to be well-known, but they point to an existing problem. Union citizens and businesses very often face a situation which, in their view, constitutes a breach of Union law. I therefore agree with the rapporteur that an easily accessible online complaint form should be created. It will effectively capture situations of violations of EU law. Another very important issue is whether, within the internal market, law should be governed by directives or regulations. I think the answer is not clear. On the one hand, regulations guarantee a more uniform implementation of legal provisions, which can prevent voluntary implementation of EU legislation, which often leads to protectionism. On the other hand, the directives allow for greater account to be taken of the specificities of individual Member States.

The latter involves less formalities and provides for a faster settlement in the event of a breach of EU law, which can benefit both the Member State concerned and, above all, those involved in the legislation, EU citizens and businesses.

It has a duty to explain why the conflict occurs and to make a subsequent correction.

It is an eminently political signal that MEPs gave this afternoon by rejecting, by a large majority, 5 new permits to grow GMO maize 1507, Bt11, MON810 and GM cotton 281-24-236. Eighteen months after the legislation came into force (on 2 April 2015) giving Member States a new opportunity to ban the cultivation of GMOs on their territory, of which I was rapporteur, nothing has changed. The Commission is working hard to make a move in the absence of both scientific and political consensus. This is in stark contradiction to the commitments made by President Juncker in July 2014 to change the procedure for authorising GMOs at European level.

As Parliament has proposed to the Commission to submit a new proposal that would take into account member states' concerns, which are not exclusively related to the safety issues of GMOs for health or the environment, to date this has not been done.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1454, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Tonino PICULA", "mepid": "112744", "text": "  Written. ‒ Parliament rejected a legislative proposal to amend Regulation No 2012. 1829/2003 of April 2015, as trade in genetically modified organisms takes place outside national borders, irrespective of the fact that the cultivation takes place on the territory of one Member State.  This means that the Commission's proposed national ban on 'sale and use' could be unenforceable without reintroducing border controls on imports. The Commission's draft implementing decision exceeds the implementing powers provided for in the Regulation. It is incompatible with Union law, it is incompatible with the objective of the Regulation – to provide for a high level of protection of human health and life, animal health and welfare, the environment and consumer interests with regard to genetically modified food and feed, and of course to ensure the effective functioning of the internal market.

Vice-President Dombrovskis and I are jointly responsible for the Capital Markets Union and this obviously has a close link to the sustainable finance issue. Last year we witnessed some landmark international agreements with the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and the Paris Climate Agreement (COP21). Implementing a transition towards a more sustainable world requires determined efforts in many policy areas. In terms of public finance, the EU is leading the way due to its commitment to spend at least 20% of its 2014-2020 budget on climate-related projects and policies. Work is ongoing to increase the availability of green funds through the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI). But we need to move beyond public finance and to further reach out to private investors. The financial sector has a role to play. The Capital Markets Union initiative addresses the importance of long-term and sustainable investments. In the most recent CMU Communication, the Commission has indicated a need for a broader strategy on sustainable finance. This is necessary to support investment in clean technologies and ensure that the financial system can finance growth in a sustainable manner over the long term. The Commission also monitors developments in the green bond market. A study on the potential of the bond market to finance resource-efficient investments is under preparation. The final report will be ready in November. The Commission has also adopted initiatives to increase company transparency, such as the Directive on non-financial reporting that will be transposed by the end of 2016, and the related non-binding guidelines, currently under preparation. Last July, a political agreement on IORP2 was achieved that will require occupational pension funds to consider taking into account environmental, social and governance factors in their investment decisions. The Commission is also assessing the follow-up to the recent public consultation on long-term and sustainable investment which emphasised the importance of environmental, social and governance issues for the long-term performance of companies and investors, and the challenges institutional investors faced in this area. Since sustainable finance has no boundaries, work must also be done at global level. The Commission supports the work of the FSB industry-led Task Force which will provide recommendations on climate-related financial disclosures early next year. We will take these into account as much as possible when preparing the upcoming EU guidelines on non-financial reporting. At the same time, the Commission is a member of the G20 Green Finance Study Group (GFSG), which recently identified options on how to mobilise private green investment; we will also continue this work under the German Presidency. Beyond relying on public finance and mobilising the private sector, the Commission is also looking at how, and to what extent, climate change implications could affect the financial sector or even be a source of systemic risk to it. Some EU institutions and central banks of EU Member States have already begun analysing this. Last February, the European Systemic Risk Board proposed enhanced disclosures and the incorporation of climate-related prudential risks into stress tests as policy responses to mitigate risks for the financial system. This may be a suitable trigger to integrate considerations about long-term environmental risks and opportunities into the mindset of private investors. Undoubtedly more needs to be done at EU level, and in a comprehensive manner. That is why the Commission will establish an expert group on green finance that will help formulate the EU strategy. This group will provide advice on how to mobilise private capital for sustainable and green investments; and to better understand and deal with the financial risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy. The expert group will be composed of senior experts representing various stakeholders of the green and sustainable finance spectrum.

Even in a country like my country, which is far from the oceans, we have climate change that simply cannot be explained. That is why all the efforts that are being made to mobilise the funding needed to change the structure of economies, from economies that consume a lot of fuel that generate greenhouse gas emissions, to economies that substantially reduce these greenhouse gas emissions are welcomed. I note, from the word of the Vice-President of the European Commission, Katainen, a number of initiatives that the European Commission has in this area. Indeed, there is a fundamental problem to which we must give an answer: how do we attract private capital in this financing? We know very well: private equity will not go into this financing unless it sees a favourable return for investors. That is why the efforts we are making to achieve the Single Capital Market in the European Union and the other efforts are welcome. Let us not forget that there was a commitment, made several years ago, by all the countries of the world, to make a fund of about a hundred billion to finance the transition to an economy that responds to the challenges of climate change, and practically little has been achieved from this commitment, at the time, of the countries. Within the European Union we have a lot of funds that can also be used from the European Union budget, but also from the resources of the Member States, which can be used to encourage this shift to a green energy economy. I would, however, like to mention here that the populations, the population, the citizens, however, have had a negative reaction to certain incentive schemes that we have made, especially for those who invested in green energy (wind and so on), where there were simply too many incentives to what was normal. So I think that here we need to act very clearly, to all think about what the optimal size of incentives must be for those who invest in green energy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 4, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1625, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Bernd KÖLMEL", "mepid": "124824", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take back from the ECR Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner Katainen, thank you for your report. I would like to start this debate in such a way that I would like to stress that environmental aspects do not override basic arithmetic. This means that when we talk about sustainable finances, we should first of all look at the situation of the EU and its Member States. A large proportion of EU countries are over-indebted. Not only that, but also the private sector and the citizens of these countries have accumulated large mountains of debt. However, if the economy and the citizens are heavily indebted, these countries end up with low tax revenues, and as the tip of the iceberg, we see that states such as Greece or Italy have long since ceased to be able to finance themselves on the capital market. Sustainable finances mean that you can only spend as much as you have. If you want to spend more, you can take out a loan – but that can only be done as long as you can pay the interest and the repayments due for it. This simple truth has been disregarded by some states for a long time.  There are always reasons to take on debt for this. But we have almost never seen states repay their debts. When the debt has reached a certain size – some speak of a limit of 90 percent debt in terms of gross domestic product – then in the long run there is hardly any escape from this spiral. And the behaviour of the euro area countries is a deterrent example of unsustainable, unsolidarity. The euro is based on the Maastricht Treaty, and its core elements are debt ceilings and a so-called 'no bail out' clause. In the past 15 years, the provisions of this treaty have been broken well over 100 times – without consequences! Only seven euro Member States currently meet the debt ceiling, and if you add up the payments and guarantees from the euro area countries, including the ECB's Target II balances, you get tens of billions of euros that are on fire here. And denying this amounts to a gigantic irresponsibility. The European Commission also has a responsibility to do so, Commissioner: it is the guardian of the European Treaties, and it must ensure that it is respected. Then we would have sound finances, and then we could talk on a completely different basis about whether we could open up new instruments and finance so-called green projects. However, the European Commission is not complying with its obligation. Instead, the ECB has taken on the task of keeping the euro countries afloat. To prevent reasonable interest rates, it is pumping billions into this financial system through a government bond-buying program. But the ECB has made itself a prisoner of its own policy here. The zero interest rate policy removes the pressure of reform from the crisis states, with the result that the debt continues. So what do we have to do to get out of this dilemma? We need, first of all, an honest, analytical approach to this sovereign funding crisis. And that includes countries that do not meet the Maastricht criteria having to leave the euro area. Of course, we must not leave these countries alone with their problems. This requires aid and also debt cuts. We must share them. But it is true: \"better an end with terror than a terror without end\". In addition, we really need to be sustainable. This means that there will no longer be pump-funded election gifts. These must be as taboo as investments in which the state cannot afford to repay depreciation. We must not continue on a path towards even more state investment, even more redistribution, even more governance of the economy and also of the citizens. That is the wrong way to go! Instead, we must finally free the forces of the economy from their shackles. In other words, we need fewer regulations, we need to take the citizens more with us in all the projects that we are planning – as good as they may be. But it is not acceptable to be able to steer a European Union in one direction from any headquarters where we are pretending what to do and what is not. I therefore appeal to you and the Commission to make a commitment! Ensure that the existing contracts are respected. Otherwise, we cannot assume that the EU states will comply with new treaties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1626, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Club. – Dear President, when my friends from my student days see that I was talking about sustainable finances, they will probably laugh because I used to be editor-in-chief of a magazine called Bankruptcy during my studies. A magazine that came out only in zero numbers because it was immediately banned afterwards, because during communism there was no talk of bankruptcy. It could not be said in what was then Yugoslavia, which was at least a little more open than other eastern states.  However, today we can talk about bankruptcy, today we can also talk about that, as we know, some countries and even eurozone countries are close to bankruptcy or have been close to bankruptcy, that some cities, some local self-government units have come into a situation to go bankrupt and that some regions have come into serious financial trouble. We really need to talk about these and such sustainable finances here. And that is why I support this initiative that we are hearing about today from the Commission, but I want to add something, as my small contribution. I think in any case we need to talk about the synergy of financing many projects that are important to us especially when we talk about climate change and green projects that simply cannot be seriously financed without having in mind the need for various types of subsidies.  So, if we are talking about this synergy that we can produce, I see this synergy between what the Commission is doing and what the Commission can finance through, in particular, cohesion policy, but of course all that can be done by the European Investment Bank, what member states can do and what they can do, I insist on it, and regional and local authorities in areas where some projects are done because we know very well that both regional and local authorities have subsidy options and can help in the realization of various projects.  When we talk specifically about energy, I am more than satisfied that finally one project in Croatia, called Plomin 3, is no longer in operation because it was the idea to use coal and to re-ruin the next twenty, thirty years one area. However, to invest in wind farms and solar energy, as we have a number of examples in Croatia, we know that it is looking for the right kind of subsidies and in this context I seriously think that the Commission has to come out with concrete proposals where we really need to use solar energy in Europe because it is not logical for me that on many parallels where the sun has very little we often see solar power plants or attempts to use the cost-effectiveness of the sun for energy purposes.  And finally, I would add that, I am convinced that all these aspects of funding that are available can create sustainable financing, not bankrupt us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1627, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Molly SCOTT CATO", "mepid": "124942", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, now that EU has ratified the Paris Agreement, we have a tremendous challenge to decarbonise our economy, but also a tremendous opportunity. Humanity’s journey into the fossil fuel era was marked by the enclosure of common resources, monopoly control and the growth in inequality. Finding ways to develop and invest in renewable resources offers a wonderful opportunity to do things differently. This is why, as Greens, we believe that sustainable finance must also be equitable finance. The overwhelming majority of finance for the green transition so far is private finance. Through the creation of green bonds, bankers can make use of what financiers like to call ‘the magic of money’ to multiply an initial stock of capital many times over, with the value of this multiplication staying with the shareholders and employees of the bank.  So the need to invest in a sustainable future could be used to swell bank profits, exacerbating inequality. How much better it would be if the magic of money could be used for the benefit of the citizens of the world, if we funded the transition through public banking and through community ownership. Then the value of money creation could be invested for public good and the value of renewable energy could accrue to local communities. The German KfW Bank provides an excellent model of such a method of capturing the power of banking for public good and I think such a model should be at the heart of sustainable finance.  I have also championed the idea of green quantitative easing to ensure that some of the vast amount of money being created by the European Central Bank should be channelled towards green investments. I believe the Commission and Parliament need to work together to undertake a critical review of the impact of the current QE programme and find ways to ensure that it is redesigned to play a central role in the financing of the green economy in Europe.  For some time Greens in this House have been ringing the alarm bell about the systemic risk to financial services, products and companies from assets which are grossly overvalued in the context of the EU’s policies to tackle climate change. Since at least 75% of fossil fuel reserves have to be kept in the ground if we are to keep within the 2° global warming limit agreed in Paris, companies, banks and pension funds that have significant fossil—related assets on their books are vastly overvalued, a phenomenon known as the carbon bubble. McKinsey and others have estimated that 30% to 40% of fossil fuel companies’ value could be threatened by this carbon bubble. Mark Carney, Governor of the Bank of England, has responded to this alert, as has Mario Draghi, as evidenced in the report produced by the European Systemic Risk Board. We have taken an important first step to tackle the carbon bubble in the specific case of pensions, as was mentioned by the Commissioner. The Parliament has voted that the extent of these stranded assets must be notified to the regulatory authorities, but we should not stop there. It is not only pensions that are at risk. Insurance companies are also holding large quantities of stranded assets. Both the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB) and the Ecofin Council have discussed the idea of undertaking carbon stress tests for banks and we need to make urgent progress on that front. We should also consider other options put forward by the ESRB, such as regulatory loss absorbency requirements, specific capital surcharges based on the carbon intensity of individual exposure, and large exposure limits applied to the overall investment in assets deemed highly vulnerable. We can also learn from others. France, for example, has introduced the world’s first mandatory climate disclosure requirements for institutional investors and the US Securities and Exchange Commission is now also taking steps towards mandatory disclosure requirements. The European Commission should make a proposal for similar legislation EU wide. These are just some of the actions governments and central banks are taking to address the risks posed by the carbon bubble. The EU needs to take similar action and, in this context, we welcome your proposal for a sustainable finance expert group. Since the private finance market will inevitably play an important role in financing the transition, it is important that it is properly regulated and focused. The EU is proud of its leadership role on climate change, but is falling behind on the issue of sustainable finance. London has launched a green finance initiative and Luxembourg has followed suit, as has France.  China is working on green finance, as is Bangladesh. There is a veritable climate finance race going on, with countries vying to be the first to turn their capital markets the greenest the fastest, investing in climate solutions instead of climate problems. The EU should set the highest standards in this field. In particular, we should introduce clear criteria for what constitutes a green bond. At present this is something of a Wild West, with bonds claiming green status on the flimsiest of justifications. Vice—President Dombrovskis, we are pleased to see progress on this important issue since the departure of Commissioner Hill, but time is also pressing. International developments are moving fast, from the G20 Green Finance Study Group to the FSB Climate Disclosure Task Force. We should ensure that we are part of these developments, which is why it is so important that you move rapidly to establish your expert group and the publication of an EU sustainable finance strategy should not be far behind. This will give us enough time to come forward with timely legislative proposals.  So we welcome this opportunity to debate the economic opportunities offered by the urgent need to transition to more sustainable industrial and energy systems. We urge that the needs of climate and environment are placed first when sustainable finance is being developed and that attention is paid to the opportunities to achieve greater equity alongside greater sustainability.

We meet today at a special moment. On Tuesday, we agreed to the ratification by the Member States of the Paris Climate Agreement. This is certainly good news in the context of the fight against climate warming, as it gives an ambitious direction to low-carbon innovation, which can provide a very strong impetus for the whole of the European Union. However, investment in a low-carbon economy requires significant financial investment. I know that the European Commission is currently examining the barriers faced by companies in terms of access to finance for innovation. Commissioner, this is a very good direction to provide the most effective and widely available funding. Investing in new technologies, particularly in energy, is a huge challenge for those countries whose economies are still based on traditional energy sources such as coal. It is therefore pleased that the European Commission is supporting Member States in their efforts to combat climate warming. However, due to the constraints on public financial resources, private investment is becoming particularly important in the context of financing new technologies. In this context, it will be extremely important for the Commission to use the full potential of the European Fund for Strategic Investments and other sources to freeze private funds. Europe needs significant, long-term and sustainable investment to improve productivity and move to a low-carbon and resource-efficient economy. The EFSI also operates in conjunction with other European Union funds and in the context of the Capital Markets Union. This gives a new impetus to this change by increasing the number and size of sustainable projects to be financed in line with the ambitious objectives of the Paris Climate Agreement.  Therefore, a large contribution of the EFSI to the financing of this type of project should be ensured.  A low-carbon economy means moving to a whole new reality, especially in countries where the use of fossil fuels, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions, is very firmly entrenched. A well-prepared strategy for the transition towards a low-carbon can provide a very strong development boost, both for all European countries and for the Union as a whole. However, in order for this to happen, the strategy should be tailored to the socio-economic realities of the country concerned and take into account the changing global context, geopolitical location, energy mix and access to raw materials. The local dimension should also be taken into account when developing financial instruments and capital markets to support the transition to a clean technology economy. For this reason, the European Commission should particularly support the development of financial instruments aimed at the small and medium-sized enterprises sector, which very often have problems with access to finance and which are key players in local markets. Let us also remember that the benefits of moving to a low-carbon economy and an economy based on, for example, clean coal technologies are often investments in new, highly specialised jobs. In the context of sustainable finance, the impact of supported investments on national and local labour markets is extremely important. Through financial instruments, we should support those sectors that have a chance of further development and those that indirectly generate additional jobs. It is also important to provide funding for investment in skills and adequate retraining and retraining of workers. I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that my region is currently carrying out the largest infrastructure investment in Poland – the construction of two new power blocks with a total capacity of 1 800 megawatts, which will ensure the stability and security of electricity supply in my country and provide hundreds of new jobs. However, all this would not have been possible without adequate funding and the creation of a consortium that would meet the capital requirements. Unfortunately, this investment has been criticised here in this House, which I have been vehemently opposed. I would remind you that the Opole power plant was the first in Poland to implement the EMAS system in 2005. It is a modern source of electricity and heat generation. The negative environmental impact has been minimised and the installations used reduce emissions of sulphur dioxide, nitric oxide and noise dust.

It contributes to growing the economy, increasing citizens' standards, preventing criminal activity, corruption, terrorist financing. There has been the most talk here today about this aspect, about climate change and the green economy, but financial sustainability is important for the overall, not just the financial life of our societies and our states. For example, the pension systems of our countries, a large number of them, are at the limit of sustainability, and since these systems overall make up a large part of public finances, their breakdown can lead to the breakdown of overall public finances. That's why this topic we're dealing with is very important.  It is certainly necessary to create mechanisms for reporting, monitoring, financial flows. Similarly, surveillance mechanisms. In Europe, we need to create a banking union that will allow banking guarantee deposits to be monitored and bad financial arrangements monitored between the state and banks. That is why we have established European supervisory authorities, we have other mechanisms. Last October, we adopted an amended directive on payment administrations, which should be part of Member States' legislation within two years. Mr. Commissioner mentioned the non-financial reporting directive. So we have mechanisms, but we often do not use these mechanisms in the way necessary.  In EU action internationally, we also need to work to improve financial supervision and create a mechanism for crisis prevention and crisis management, in particular in cooperation with our main trading partners such as the US, Canada and Japan, but also with the growing financial markets of China, India, Russia and Brazil. All these mechanisms should be found in all other bilateral and multilateral agreements concluded by the EU, especially in development aid programmes, as the EU is a bigger donor than all other countries together with EUR 68 billion in 2015. We can use this development aid to develop these mechanisms in developing countries that are actually most at risk from the problem of financial sustainability, i.e. the danger that unsustainability hides.  I therefore welcome this position of the European Commission, I call for the application of the existing mechanisms we have and the development of new ones, and the first step towards that would be to respect the rules we have adopted ourselves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1630, "date": "2016-10-06.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "   – Mr President, firstly, I must say that, looking back over the last two years when President Juncker announced his EFSI plan, many people very dubious and when Vice-President Katainen was handed what many saw as the poison chalice, they felt that this could not actually be successful. But he has worked very hard on the area, he has visited all over Europe and here in Strasbourg and in Brussels. As a result, it has actually been very successful, and only today it was announced that EFSI has helped to create 830 000 jobs – it is worth repeating, 830 000 jobs! He deserves great credit for that, as does the Commission, because if it had failed, they would have been criticised and ridiculed, which many people expected. So now that it has started, the momentum is behind it and people will believe in it. I think you will get far more investment, especially when he introduces regulatory reform to undo or eliminate any obstacles there for the private sector to invest. That is going to be very important, and also of course we recently passed the creation of the Capital Markets Union, and that is going to make a huge difference in terms of new models and creating new ways of financing.  So those three aspects – EFSI, regulatory reform, and the Capital Markets Union – are going to be wonderful in terms of creating sustainable finance into the future. Also I was delighted to hear him in his opening remarks refer to green financing. Of course, the climate has changed dramatically for that in the past 12 months, as a result of the Paris Agreement and now Marrakesh, where the agreement will be actually turned into action. So it will be imperative to invest in the green economy; it will be the only show in town and that should unlock huge opportunities for businesses, and for Europe, indeed, to become a world leader. So, well done to Vice-President Katainen and everyone involved. They deserve credit; they do not always get it.

The challenge of keeping global warming below two degrees will require a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. This process of decarbonisation provides opportunities for the European economy and industries. However, this transition can also create risks. The European Systemic Risk Board warned about the adverse scenario where the transition to a low carb economy comes late and abruptly. In this case, the cost of the transition will be higher, with severe effects on economic and financial institutions. In other words, our financial institutions’ pension schemes and insurance companies have to adjust to a new reality very soon in order to avoid potential risk for our economic system and economy. This is why it is crucially important that the Commission further assesses the systemic risk associated with the low carbon transition and proposes, where necessary, transparency requirements and policies to mitigate systematic risk as much as possible. In that way, the Commission will enrich financial markets with more information so the market itself can address the risks. It is necessary to do it quickly and I insist that the Commission does not hesitate on that matter.

A few colleagues, especially Mr Kölmel and Mr Jakovčić, referred to the Stablility and Growth Pact and this is obviously part of the interpretation on sustainability, even though the focus of today’s discussion was maybe more on carbon and environmental related issues. But when talking about a more general interpretation of sustainability, the Stability and Growth Pact issues are very, very important and the rules must be followed. Otherwise, the basis of public financing is on a slippery slope.  I would like to start by making one more general remark. When talking about sustainable financing or green financing, I would like to avoid marginalising this topic to only very narrowly interpreted projects, because sustainable financing is supposed to be mainstream – over time – and not just complementary to main financing. That is why our focus as legislators and regulators should be to look at the needs and the possible changes in our regulatory environment in order to encourage the private sector to change their business models to be more sustainable; and also in the banking sector to look if there is anything on the regulatory side that we should change in order to make it possible for the private banks then to address the needs of, for instance, businesses in the circular economy. I have met some bankers who have said that they have a completely new set of clients, that the business models have changed from linear to circular and that is why sometimes small and medium-sized enterprises’ balance sheets look different today from how they did earlier. That is why they are developing new financing products for these kinds of companies. That is why, as Mr Kelly said, we have to look very openly at the need to change regulation, but not rush too early to change everything; that is crucial.  Mrs Scott Cato raised several very important points. You referred to the importance of public financing when looking at the EU opportunities in financing sustainable projects. There are plenty of opportunities, as we all know – structural funds, of course, but also EFSI. We are now proposing to extend EFSI’s lifeline so that it will last longer, and also its firepower will be significantly higher. We will also propose that some 40% of EFSI financing should be on COP21-related projects. It can of course mean lots of different things, but sustainability should in any event play an even more important role than at the moment in EFSI operations.  The carbon stress tests and the French model of disclosure are both very interesting opportunities. The Commission is following the results and further work on both these fields. Carbon stress tests, as proposed by the European Systemic Risk Board, could be a very important risk management tool. However, the complexity of designing appropriate test scenarios and of collecting the data necessary for conducting tests should not be underestimated, especially given the lack of harmonisation in defining what is green. The analytical work at G20 level within the Green Finance Study Group should help us identify optimal methodologies for such stress tests. DG FISMA is actively involved in this project. It would be excellent if we managed to find a global definition of these issues because then the impact would of course be bigger. So there are several work streams at a global level, but also at European level, which are addressing the same issue and we can learn from each other. Hopefully, next year we will be wiser and we will have new results from various working groups.   My final point is about EFSI. I come back to the EFSI issue because, as you know, EFSI is a demand—driven fund, and overwhelmingly the biggest challenge we have at the moment is that we have to raise awareness amongst possible investors about what EFSI can do. I have been a little disappointed that, for instance on the circular economy field, investors have not found EFSI as much as I would hope. Your role as MEPs and our role in the Commission is just to raise awareness about what EFSI can do and what it has already done in various Member States and try to copy the best practices and best models. For instance, in France there is a fantastic example of energy-efficiency investment where the public—private partnership companies collected together 40 000 houses or apartments for retrofitting in order to reduce energy consumption. I have just heard that in the average apartment, the energy saving after they been retrofitted is EUR 80 per month for a family living in an apartment. This of course has a big impact on the climate policy too.  I would like once again to thank Member for your ideas. Let us continue to work together in this field.
