This is still very fresh and the delegations are studying it as we meet. You will therefore understand that I am not in a position to address the substance of the proposals. There will be other occasions for that. At this stage, I would like to recall the delegations’ expectations and tell you how the Presidency intends to take the work forward. First, I will start with the expectations. At the end of April, leaders agreed to work towards establishing a Recovery Fund, and I quote, ‘which is needed and urgent’. Their expectation is that this fund should be of sufficient magnitude and targeted toward the sectors and geographical parts of Europe most affected and be dedicated to dealing with this unprecedented crisis. The Commission was therefore tasked with analysing the exact needs and to urgently come up with a proposal that is commensurate with the challenge we are facing. The Commission was expected to clarify the link with the MFF, which, according to the leaders, will need to be adjusted to deal with the current crisis and its consequences. As a response to this tasking, the Commission prepared a comprehensive package of horizontal proposals, which is presented today. The political guidance was clear. Delegations will assess the package in this light, and work on the details starts now. Turning now to how the Presidency intends to organise the work, the key word is urgency. Last month the leaders emphasised their commitment to reaching an agreement as soon as possible. We all know that time is running out, and we need to move ahead as fast as possible. Our economies require it; our citizens expect it. It is therefore the Presidency’s responsibility to take work forward on the Commission’s proposal without delay. In line with that, the Ministers of European Affairs held a discussion on the  comprehensive economical and social recovery of the EU, including an adjusted MFF and a recovery instrument, at an informal video conference yesterday. Furthermore, we put this as a topic on the agenda of COREPER for a first discussion immediately after the presentation of this package today. Technical work will also be required to understand the proposals before leaders can have a meaningful discussion. To that end, we will mobilise the Council at all levels, both physically and with help from technology. Throughout, we will be attentive to the Parliament’s views. In this spirit, we reviewed carefully the resolution you adopted at the last plenary on the new MFF, own resources and recovery plan. As mentioned on that occasion, continuous cooperation between the Council and the European Parliament will be an essential part of the process, either at horizontal level or at sectorial level. I take this occasion to remind you that, beyond the MMF agreement, there are dozens of other negotiations. They concern programmes that turn EU support into actions on the ground. There too, time is of the essence. We have to make as much progress as possible at sectorial level. We need to make the most of the time available now. We owe it to all the future beneficiaries of these programmes, including students, small businesses, local authorities and others. Now more than ever, they will need our support to get their projects off the ground. This will help the recovery of our economies, our regions and our cities, and we look forward to working with you to meet these expectations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2020-05-27.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   présidente de la Commission. – Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, l’Europe est une histoire de générations et chaque génération européenne a sa propre histoire. Pour la génération fondatrice de notre Union, l’histoire parlait de la construction d’une paix durable là où il n’y avait rien que de la peine, de la douleur et de la destruction. Pour la génération d’après, il s’agissait de poursuivre la prospérité et la liberté, en choisissant l’unité de notre marché intérieur et notre monnaie unique. Ensuite, nous nous sommes attachés à rassembler notre famille européenne en sortant nos frères et nos sœurs du grand froid et en accueillant nos frères et nos sœurs ici, chez eux, en plein cœur de notre Union. Toutes ces générations et tous ces succès historiques ont été bâtis sur ceux d’avant et ont inspiré ceux d’après. Et le choix a toujours été, soit de prendre la voie de la moindre résistance tout seul, soit d’aller de l’avant, ensemble, avec une vision, une ambition et dans la même direction. Dans ces moments décisifs, nous avons toujours choisi de faire le saut en avant ensemble car, pour l’Europe, les mesures les plus audacieuses seront toujours les plus sûres. C’est cela qui nous a permis de construire une Union de paix et de prospérité sans égale, sans précédent dans le monde.  Honourable Members, today we face our very own defining moment. What started with a virus so small your eyes couldn’t see it has become an economic crisis so big that you simply cannot miss it. Our unique model, built over 70 years, is being challenged like never before in our lifetime or our Union’s history. The common European goods we have built together are being damaged. Things we take for granted are being questioned. There’s the single market that needs to recover. There’s the playing field that needs to be made even again. There are four freedoms that need to be fully restored. The crisis has huge externalities and spill-overs across all countries and cannot be fixed by any single country alone. A bankrupt company in one Member State is a reliable supplier gone for business in another. A struggling economy in one part of Europe weakens a strong economy in another part. This is about all of us, and it is way bigger than any of us. This is Europe’s moment. We see the economic, fiscal and social fallout across all Member States. Divergences and disparities widen. Complex questions of sovereignty and burden-sharing have to be balanced. And so, in front of us once again is that same binary choice: we either all go it alone, leaving countries, regions and people behind and accepting a Union of haves and have-nots, or we walk that road together. We take that leap forward. We pave a strong path for our people and for the next generation. And for me the choice is simple. I want us to take a new, bold step together. Europe is in a unique position to be able to invest in a collective recovery and a common future. In our Union, people, business and companies depend and rely on each other. In our Union, cohesion, convergence and investment are good for all. And in our Union, we know that the boldest measures truly are the safest for the future. This is why the Commission is today proposing a new recovery instrument called NextGenerationEU, worth EUR 750 billion. It will sit on top of a revamped long-term EU budget of EUR 1.1 trillion. NextGenerationEU, together with a core Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), amounts to EUR 1.85 trillion in today’s proposal. It goes alongside the three safety nets of EUR 540 billion already agreed by Parliament and Council. In sum, this would bring our recovery effort to a total of EUR 2.4 trillion. Honourable Members, allow me to explain how Next Generation EU will work. The money will be raised by temporarily lifting the own resources ceiling to allow the Commission to use its very strong credit rating to borrow money on the financial markets. This is an urgent and exceptional necessity for an urgent and exceptional crisis. NextGenerationEU will invest in repairing our social fabric, protect our single market and help rebalance balance sheets across Europe. And while we are doing this, we need to press fast forward towards a green, digital and resilient future, because this is the future of Europe’s next generation – this generation that is globally connected and feels responsible for our world, our planet, with a clear vision to promote human dignity and the rule of law, determined to hold governments more accountable for fighting climate change and saving our nature, driven by the idealism for Europe and the belief that our Union must strive for better. So beyond showing solidarity to overcome the crisis of today, I want to propose a new generational pact for tomorrow. Yes, the effects of this crisis mean that we need to make investments on an unprecedented scale today, but we will do it in a way that Europe’s next generation will reap the benefits tomorrow – investments that will not only preserve the outstanding achievements of the last 70 years but will ensure that our Union is climate neutral, is digital, is social and a strong global player also in the future. To make this happen, NextGenerationEU will direct its massive financial power to invest in our common priorities through European programmes. Honourable Members, I am always keen to ensure that this House has its full say on crucial decisions of our Union. My proposal to invest these funds via programmes in our European budget achieves exactly that. NextGenerationEU will restore and rebuild our single market, that great generator of innovation, prosperity and opportunity. All Member States need to invest in technologies that will spark the recovery through new innovation and clean industries. NextGenerationEU strengthens the European Green Deal and Horizon Europe and will invest in key infrastructure, from 5G to housing renovation. At the same time, we must ensure that the transition to a climate-neutral economy leaves nobody behind. NextGenerationEU will therefore multiply the funding for the Just Transition Fund. In the same vein, no Member State should have to choose between responding to the crisis or investing in our people. Therefore, NextGenerationEU increases Erasmus and youth employment support. It makes sure that people get the skills and the training and the education they need to adapt to this rapidly-changing world. NextGenerationEU will help those perfectly healthy companies that have made the right decisions and investment over decades but that find themselves at risk now because competitors in other Member States have better access to public or private money to get fresh capital. It will invest in key European industries and technologies to make crucial supply chains more resilient. It will ensure Europe remains cutting-edge in key areas like artificial intelligence, precision farming or green engineering. And NextGenerationEU will help make our health systems more resilient for future crises. This investment will be a new European common good. It will show the true and tangible value of being part of the Union. And it will be owned by us all. In total, the Commission will raise EUR 750 billion for NextGenerationEU. Of that total, EUR 500 billion will be distributed in grants and EUR 250 billion in loans passed onto Member States. Meine Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Lassen Sie mich ganz klarstellen: Diese Zuschüsse, diese grants, sind eine gemeinsame Investition in unsere Zukunft. Sie haben mit den Schulden der Mitgliedstaaten aus der Vergangenheit nichts zu tun. Die Zuschüsse gehen durch den europäischen Haushalt, und dieser begrenzt die Zahlung eines jeden Landes nach einem festen Schlüssel. Die Zuschüsse gehen klar als Investitionen in unsere europäischen Prioritäten: die Stärkung unseres Binnenmarktes, die Digitalisierung, den europäischen Grünen Deal, die Resilienz. Und mehr noch: Der europäische Haushalt hat immer aus Zuschüssen bestanden. Das ist nichts Neues. Zuschüsse für gezielte Investitionen und Reformen, Zuschüsse für mehr Zusammenhalt, Zuschüsse für eine Annäherung der Lebensverhältnisse in Europa. Unsere Europäische Union ist der lebende Beweis dafür, dass es funktioniert. Durch die Europäische Union sind die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit, der Wohlstand und der Lebensstandard eines jeden Mitgliedslandes gestiegen. Diese Investitionen über das europäische Budget haben sich für alle um ein Vielfaches ausgezahlt. Und so ist auch NextGenerationEU für uns alle. Wir investieren gemeinsam in Europas Zukunft und zahlen die Gesamtsumme nach einem bekannten und erprobten Schlüssel über zukünftige Haushalte zurück. Und zusätzlich wird die Kommission dazu eine Reihe neuer, eigener Einnahmequellen vorschlagen. Diese könnten zum Beispiel auf dem geplanten Ausbau des Emissionshandels basieren oder auf einer CO2—Grenzsteuer, die als Ausgleichsmechanismus gegen den Import billiger klimaschädlicher Produkte aus dem Ausland fungiert, und/oder auf einer neuen Digitalsteuer, damit dort, wo Milliardengewinne gemacht werden, auch ein Beitrag zum Gemeinwohl erfolgt. Hier müssen wir ambitioniert sein, und hier zähle ich auf Ihre volle Unterstützung. Meine Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Jetzt ist die Zeit, die richtige Entscheidung zu treffen. Denjenigen, die heute die mutige Investition scheuen, sage ich, dass uns morgen die Kosten des Nichthandelns in dieser Krise viel teurer zu stehen kommen. Hier geht es darum, gemeinsam Grundlagen für unsere Zukunft zu legen, und zugleich darum, auf eine klar umrissene, unverschuldete, außergewöhnliche Krisensituation angemessen zu reagieren. Deshalb lasst uns diese alten Vorurteile beiseitelegen! Lasst uns stattdessen die Kraft wiederentdecken, die von dieser großen Idee eines gemeinsamen Europas ausgeht! Die Krise, mit der wir jetzt umgehen müssen, ist gewaltig. Aber ebenso gewaltig ist die Chance für Europa und unsere Verantwortung, in dieser Situation das Richtige zu tun. Wir können jetzt die Grundlagen legen für eine Union, die klimaneutral ist, die digital ist, die robuster ist und die sozial ist, die besser aufgestellt ist als je zuvor. Vor siebzig Jahren unternahmen unsere Gründungsväter und -mütter den ersten mutigen Schritt, um eine Union des Friedens und eine Union des Wohlstands zu schaffen. Heute ist der Moment, das Kapitel unserer Generation hinzuzufügen und einen weiteren mutigen Schritt in eine Union der Nachhaltigkeit zu tun. Wir sind das der nächsten Generation schuldig.

European solidarity is back. The spirit of Robert Schuman is back. European flags burned a few weeks ago on the streets in Italy, for example. Millions of people inside of the European Union are still concerned, even afraid, about the future, about their jobs, about their families. And Europe is giving today a strong answer: you are not alone. We together will pick up the challenge and give a good answer with a fundament of solidarity. We open even a new chapter for the European Union. Some call it a Hamilton moment – the current situation. Frankly speaking, as an EPP politician, I don’t like it, because I don’t want to see Europe based on making debts, on borrowing money – that is not my dream about Europe. But having the situation in mind, the economic crisis in mind, in the middle of the biggest economic crisis since the Second World War, we see no alternative but to invest now, to give our economy a new boost. And the key question for us is not, first of all, how massive the investment must be - how much money do we spend? That is not the first question for us. The first question is: what is it for? And one of our principles is (and that is guaranteed now) with the proposal: we guarantee that we are not having fresh money for the old problems of the continent. We have to guarantee that we use fresh money for the new ideas for the fresh future for this continent. Another element, which was crucial for us in the debates and the preparatory process was the democratic procedures, and I thank the Commission President for the clear statement.  Now we have to go to the Council and also clarify with the Council that the principle that no money can be spent at European level without the approval of the European Parliament is also guaranteed from the Council side. The proposal is now on the table and we have still to argue, to convince. 27 Member States’ parliaments are needed to support this general idea, and it’s funny to see that in my camp, in the EPP, we have one government, we have two socialist governments, we have one liberal government – the Netherlands – and even the Greens are part of the problem this time, because in all three of their governings – so it’s really good to see that all of us have the same challenge now to convince the others to support the general idea that is still in front of us. And to the frugal four, let me be clear with three main arguments. First of all, our companies, or your companies, cannot be successful without a successful single market, so it’s in your interest to make the whole European Union successful. The second argument is: we see a redistribution of the global economic power going on, and I don’t want to see that China is the big winner and that Europe is the big loser. And the third argument is that in 2008, 2009 and 2010, we had already faced the phenomenon of a lost generation, and Europe cannot accept another lost generation in this crisis. That is why I think we have good arguments for convincing some. For us, solidarity goes always hand-in-hand with responsibility. That is always two sides of the same coin for us in the EPP. And having this in mind, I tell you that when we go to the markets now, to borrow money, we have to be clear to have a full and strong and serious idea – an honest idea – about how to pay it back. And to say that in the next MFF, having the debates in March in mind, when the Council tried already to find a common understanding about the MFF of today, I don’t believe that this will be so easy. That’s why, as EPP – let’s be honest, let’s be clear. And that means we need own resources for paying back the debt we have now installed. The big winners of the crisis are the digital giants, and that’s why I think it’s fair to ask the digital giants to pay part of the debt we are creating now. And another part of this solidarity, responsibility, is for us all the national perspective. You can call it semester. You can call it the need of internal reforms. I think it is simply fair, if you ask your neighbour to help you, to practise solidarity. It’s simply fair to do your homework, to be better prepared for the future, and in a globalised world, we need still reforms. There are thousands of other principles which are important: rule of law; a key issue the EPP supports is the grant-loan debate: I think we have now a good compromise on the table. The health programme is upgraded – a big signal, an important signal, in today’s Corona time. And the MFF – there we will still have further discussions, and it is about agriculture and cohesion. So the plan goes in a good direction. It’s an important moment for the future of the European Union, and the EPP will generally support the ideas from the Commission.

Firstly, thank you for giving the European Parliament its rightful role, putting us in the same place as the Council in placing this recovery plan within the financial framework and own resources to which you are referring. And secondly, because this plan includes the Union's debt, the issuance of bonds by the European Commission, which allows Member States to be able to finance themselves fairly to deal with this crisis. And it's just that something has clearly changed. Some of the proposals you include, and which several governments have already shown their support for, would have been unthinkable a few months ago. The Commission and this Parliament and many of the national governments fully understand how much we are playing. We are playing the future and credibility of the European project. It is no longer just about solidarity, but also about the survival of the euro and the single market and, therefore, the survival of the European project. Because some may not have understood that we are not here to make a market — at least my political group is not to make a market — but to build a political union. Some in the Council speak as if nothing has happened here, as if the great crisis that has occurred in recent months has not occurred, as if more than 160 000 people have not died in Europe, as if the work of more than sixty million Europeans and Europeans had not been jeopardized, as if we did not know that this crisis is going to cause a great recession and that the GDP of the area of euro is going to contract by almost 8% this year. If this doesn't push us to act, I really don't know what some people are waiting for. This is the moment of truth, of putting the cards on the table. We want to continue to build a political union because this goes beyond solidarity and because we must also assume that in this increasingly convulsive world it is worth working to defend the European project. The COVID-19 crisis is a symmetrical but asymmetrical crisis. And the fundamental question today is whether we think that the European Union should correct these asymmetry. What is not to be received is to say that we are working on a common project, but then some Member States are allowed to come out in the aid of their companies, while companies in other States are left to die from a lack of resources. Because either we all go out here or nobody comes out. Now, if anyone in the Council does not believe in European solutions and convergence, what they should do is not hinder the progress of those of us who do bet on Europe. Let's face it, the problem is not to put more money, the problem is to move forward in Europe. The Council should therefore change the procedure so that it can adopt the multi-year budget by a qualified majority and not unanimously. Because it is unfair that twenty-three pro-European countries are hostages of four who prefer national responses. To me, apart from insolidarity, it seems to me a really short-sighted attitude; shortsighted, because we only have to look around to realize that multilateralism is at risk and that we need global governance. It is also time to strengthen the social pillar, to protect those who need it most. That's why I'm glad to see you've included the Child Guarantee. And it is also our duty to show solidarity with future generations, investing in the key policies for tomorrow: green and digital transformation, because we cannot destroy the environment, end biodiversity and, on its back massive debts. That is why it is essential, Mrs von der Leyen, that you keep your proposal to change the European Semester. The logic of fiscal consolidation must be overcome. We can't set conditions for pensions. Conditions must be put in place to advance environmental sustainability and social sustainability. This future that we want to build together must also be based on respect for the rule of law. Ladies and gentlemen, we must take responsibility. Mrs von der Leyen, you have already seen that here in the European Parliament you have a project ready to work always for the good of citizens. Now it's your turn to convince the Council's friends. Be firm, be ambitious and you'll have us on your side. We owe it to the next generations of the European Union.

Either we find a solution to invest massively in our economy or we accept that we will be hit even harder. Let me be clear, this is a package for all Member States, and all Member States need this package, irrespective of how badly they were affected by the health and economic crisis because the internal market is at stake. If the internal market fails, every citizen and business in the European Union will suffer. The solution by President von der Leyen for the Commission to borrow money from the market is a remarkable one, we have to recognise this. Our opinion may differ in some details, but I really welcome the approach – a European solution for a European problem. It also avoids the major difficulty we had during the last crisis: creating more debt for some Member States when in fact they need money to inject immediately in their economies. Decisions that we take now will define Europe’s road for the next 20-30 years, because we are investing massively now not only to recover but to relaunch and to modernise our economy, so we are creating debts for the generations to come. And that is why the Multiannual Framework (MFF) and the recovery package should focus on the future, not stay fixed on ideas from the past. First, we need to restore economic perspective. We need to safeguard and create new jobs. We need to focus on investment with real economic and European added value. The Green Deal and digital agenda should be the building blocks of a resilient and sovereign European economy. Second, solidarity is key. The fight against territorial divides and inequalities across Europe will be the breeding ground for our Union or the seeds of our future division, so that’s why we must stand united. Third, the European Union is not a cash machine. It’s a common project where solidarity comes with values and the shared vision for our future. And that’s why Renew Europe Group will only support MFF where the rule of law and respect of European values are a condition to receiving European funds: not to penalise people but the politicians who do not play by the rules. Fourth, certainly there are many lessons to be learned from this crisis, reasons to reform and improve areas where the European Union needs to be more present. And that is why the Conference on the Future of Europe: our common future, should get underway. The road to recovery will be long and hard. The decision we take these days will affect the future of millions of people, the future of the internal market and the future of our European Union. And that is why the European Union must stay united and fight as one.

It’s a big moment of responsibility, of thinking together, that were joining hands and we’re thinking of how to get together out of this crisis. This Parliament, with a broad majority, has shown a way forward with a substantial recovery fund, a strong MFF – a strong budget – and a Green Deal that helps the economy while addressing the climate crisis and the biodiversity crisis which have gone nowhere. I’m very glad to say that Greens all over Europe are actually supporting that, so I’m afraid Mr Weber, dear Manfred, that it is a bit cheap to hide behind the Greens when we actually have a strong support, also public support from the Austrian Greens who are supporting our position and the position of this Parliament. Maybe it is rather your best friend in Vienna who is causing the problem. But I’m glad to see that you’re also ready and willing to convince them, and try to convince them, and I am glad we can join forces there and try indeed our common job to convince governments all over parties, all over. Because that is what we need to do now, because I do believe that the Commission proposal is a very big step forward and we welcome the focus that you’ve put on grants to make sure that no Member State is left behind in this crisis. The overall volume might not prove sufficient in time, but in any case, what we need to make sure is that we don’t lessen the ambitions on the MFF because we also need to think further ahead. You have mentioned – colleagues have mentioned – conditions attached to the fund, and I would urge us all to not repeat the big mistakes of the past and force countries into austerity and blind market ideologies that have never worked, and will not work. Instead, we need to make sure that the money is well invested into projects that will help in the long term, that create jobs and that save the one planet that we have. To be meaningful in the long term, both the Recovery Fund and the MFF need to incentivise the social and ecological transformation of our economy and promote gender equality – a big problem we’ve seen in this crisis. They also need to follow our minimum common rules such as the rule of law and democracy. Some governments think that they can do it all alone, but I think they should think again. They have all benefited as much as and even more than other Member States from the single market, from freedom of movement and some, unfortunately, also from a bit too lax tax rules. Europe needs a strong step ahead. It needs courageous action like that of Schuman 70 years ago, and this Parliament has shown it is ready to do its part. I hope the Member States will follow.

Mr President, I am very impressed by the way in which our citizens and our companies are dealing with this very deep crisis in a flexible, resilient and efficient way. We must take an example of this, and our measures must also be effective. That is, if we allow loans and/or subsidies, there must be clear conditions attached to them so that the money gets where it is most needed.  We must also keep in mind that a great deal of measures can be taken that do not cost money immediately. Strengthening the internal market is absolutely necessary in this crisis and we must ensure that our business fabric is protected. International groups collect fabulous sums with which they clearly do not have the best of all intentions. We must create protection mechanisms against this.  It is now mainly about spending the money, but of course the financing must also be considered. And I think it is very important – socially speaking – that we do not let the people who work and save bleed into those funding efforts. Moreover, we must also be aware that there are limits to the way in which or the intensity with which we rely on the facilities of the European Central Bank. Sometimes we have the illusion or the illusion is created that this is endless, but of course it is not, if only because of the adverse effects that are clearly noticeable and become. In the context of these consequences, I call for a long-running debate to be settled.

Mr President, Mrs von der Leyen, for months we have been warning you that this crisis is not a parenthesis, it is rooted in years of above-ground politics that have exhausted our health systems, destroyed our industrial fabric and de-spent our social protections. You keep talking about generations and generational pacts, and I am precisely from this generation that has suffered the ravages of the liberal policies of the European Union in recent years, which have increased inequality and destroyed the planet. The recovery plan that you are presenting today should have taken a frank break with these dogmas of the past and, on this point, I regret that it stops in the middle of the ford. You first suggest that rigour and austerity were behind us, by suspending budgetary control, which was the case at the beginning of the crisis, but you are quick to bring them back through the back door with the European Semester, conditioning aid to states on a trajectory back to balanced budgets in which the right has been quick to do so. Understand: more and more austerity. Of course, not everything is to be thrown away, of course. We welcome the creation of own resources, such as the plastic tax or the carbon tax, which, in addition to having laudable ecological objectives, will partly reduce the burden on states. But how can we accept that we refuse to tax the ultra-billionaires, the big fortunes and those who have benefited from the crisis, I think, for example, the hypermarket sector whose profits have increased by 35%? We also welcome the embryo of European solidarity that you are trying to establish, by enabling the States most affected by the crisis to receive stronger support. But honestly and, let us be frank, it does not change much in the overall equation: it will always be the States that will pay the majority of the bill and therefore, in the end, the European peoples. Now on the stimulus fund: 750 billion euros is good, but that's about a third of what our European Parliament, from the right to our left-wing camp, asked for two weeks ago. And then, of the additional $500 billion that is presented as direct subsidies, it is highly unlikely that the own resources, which you did not mention the expected amount, will be sufficient. It will therefore probably still be up to the States to take on more debt to repay through the European budget. And, frankly, what a irony to call this fund a next generation fund, when we are going to ask precisely these generations to pay the cost of this debt that will be added.  Your plan, in the end, obscures a central tool that could yet enable us to avoid austerity for all: the cancellation of our debt from the crisis and the possibility for the ECB to lend directly to the states in the form of perpetual debt to protect them from market speculation. Let us free states from the burden of debt to take the time to decide calmly the direction we wish to give our societies in the face of the climate crisis and inequality. Indeed, it is absurd to discuss today the fastest way to reconnect with the myths of infinite growth and balanced budgets. The issue is where we want to go. For us, it is clear: not a euro of public money should be used to cut jobs, such as Renault in France, not a euro of public money should be spent to keep a decaying productivist system under infusion.  Greenwashing, which is to unconditionally save outdated industries, belongs precisely to your generation and to past generations. Instead, let us condition public support for social, ecological, wealth-sharing, job maintenance, dividend freezes or ecological conversion. Our group of the European Unitarian Left proposes this other path in our plan to exit the crisis. It will take no less than a radical transformation of our model to emerge from the crisis and make our societies resilient in the face of the shock to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 12, "date": "2020-05-27.json", "name": "Isabella ADINOLFI", "mepid": "124831", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr De Leyen, what we are saying right now is that some elements of your proposal give us real hope: we are talking about non-re-enter transfers, which are, on the whole, higher than loans; the issue of long-term European government bonds is good; acceleration for a digital green transition - which we have always been calling for.

The European Union is delivering. This is a new instrument. The support which it grants will be concrete. It will make a difference for people, for companies, for regions and for countries.

The involvement of the European Parliament will ensure that the recovery package is the best recovery package that we can jointly and together create. This recovery package will have an impact upon the future of the citizens, and this is why this House, which represents the citizens of the European Union, needs to be involved in all aspects.

We need to create a recovery package which supports the people and the economy to come out of the Corona crisis, but we should also not forget about the old priorities of the EU budget. We should not forget about farmers, about students. We should not forget our new priorities: the Green Deal, the security of citizens, digitalisation, and we should have enough reserves to respond to still unpredictable crises that will, for sure, occur in the next seven years.

Mistrust due to many factors, but I will name but a few for reasons of time: to finance the recovery fund, we want to introduce new taxes, taxes that will inevitably fall on small businesses and consumers, making the crisis you want to combat even worse. I have heard nothing for those sectors that are not considered strategic but that are essential for the economy of many countries: I am thinking of tourism, just to name one.

I would like to welcome the European Commission's proposal. In the previous crisis, Europe waited too long to respond, so the fact that there is now a proposal seems to me to be very important. And of course, there will be talk about the relationship between grants and loans, the amount of it, the way in which the money should be spent, but the fact that the proposal is there, I welcome that. And also because it breathes the atmosphere of \"we are all in the same boat, let's put our shoulders together and let's get out of it together\". And of course, much of this proposal stands or falls with its own resources. A lot has been said about digital taxation, I welcome that. Part of the ETS. But the key point for me is that ultimately the money is well spent. And I do have one concern.  My main concern is the fact that we're now entering into debt that is unavoidable in this crisis, but it's unclear how and when it is going to be repaid. And my concern is that, if we don't get own resources – because if one Member State opposes, we won't get them – in the end we will have to use our European budget to actually repay this debt, having less money at our disposal to do actual politics and policies. Therefore, I would like to see a real commitment from the Council that we will get own resources in time or that we start a repayment plan within this MFF already. We need clarity for this programme to work. And then let me say one thing to Madame García Pérez. I've just said in Dutch, my mother tongue, because I think it's important, that we need to shoulder this proposal all together, that we're all in the same boat, and that we need to work together. But if you propose making this a matter of 23 against four, we won't succeed. You will push those four countries into the arms of the extreme right if you say: let's do this without unanimity.

First, I really would like to thank you for what I felt was very strong, overwhelming support in most of the interventions for the ambitious proposal the Commission has tabled today. And I really would like to thank you for the inspiration, which on many occasions we have drawn from this House, from your resolutions, from the debates that we had with you, when we’ve been looking for ways to best respond to your calls for demonstrating more solidarity, for using this crisis as an opportunity to modernise the European economy and for consolidating the position of Europe as a global actor and global player. We put forward proposals, which was never done before. It’s really without precedent, because what we wanted to do was to adapt the initial multiannual financial perspective proposal to the current needs and because we fully realised that the economic crisis is so sharp and so deep, we knew that we need to come up with a new instrument, which we named Next Generation EU. Altogether, we are talking about EUR 1.1 trillion of the proposal for MFF, an additional EUR 750 billion for the Next Generation instrument, which would be divided between grants and loans, as you suggested in your resolution. I very much appreciate that Mr Weber, Ms García Pérez and Mr Cioloș supported this approach and I would like to reassure you that we know that the success of the results – if we invest the money in the right areas, and we definitely want to do that – we fully realise that if we want to modernise the European economy, we have to invest in green, sustainable technologies. We have to be much more digital than we are right now, and we have to learn our lessons for improving the resilience of the European economy, because we learned how difficult it is to be dependent on some global value chains or single supplier of such sensitive health materials as we have seen over the last few months. So what we have put on the table is that the proposal has to not only overcome the crisis, but has to modernise, has to respect the important social aspects of our policy and has to make Europe really ready for the post-COVID 21st-century world. A lot of questions – and some of them presented with a great vigour – have been linked to debts and also to own resources – Mr Meuthen, Ms Aubry, Mr Van Overtveldt. Here again, I would like to tell you that we did our homework. We studied the issue very carefully and we have come up with different options for own resources, which you want to, of course, explore with you and with the Member States. We want to use the new ETS revenues, which will be coming eventually from the aviation and maritime sector, to use them for financing parts of the MFF in the future. We are considering the so-called ‘single market tax’, especially from those companies which are benefiting from the fact that the single market is so big and functions that well. We will be following carefully how other countries and powers on this planet are respecting the Paris goals and if they are really reducing the carbon footprint of their products and their economy, and we will be ready to proceed if necessary with a carbon adjustment tax which, again, could be revenue for the European budget. And we are, of course, not forgetting about the possibility of digital taxation where, of course, we want to have a global agreement, preferably within the OECD or G20, but if this did not work, we are ready to consider to go alone. And Ms Szydło and Mr Azmani have highlighted the importance of tax evasion and unfair tax practices. This is, of course, one of the priorities upon which we are going to focus, and for us, the proper execution of the European budget and proper tax collection is, of course, one of the key priorities. To be quite honest, I didn’t quite get the comment of the honourable Member, Mr Gyöngyösi, who was criticising us for lack of transparency. At 12 o’clock, we in the College adopted these very important proposals, and at one o’clock the whole College was here. The European Parliament was the first audience where we presented our proposals, where our President went into great detail about what we want to do and how we want to accomplish it. And therefore, I think that that tradition where we fully respect the democratic scrutiny of the European Parliament would be, of course, maintained in the future, and we will be debating with you all of the legislative proposals, which are very complex and where we need close cooperation and very close consultation. There’ve been several questions linked with state aid. I have to say that my colleague, Executive Vice-President Vestager, is known for her vigour in reviewing and assessing every single application, and we also have to agree that these last three months have been totally exceptional. At first, we had to fight for the lives of our citizens, then for the livelihoods and for jobs, and this is what we’ve been, with your help, doing since the beginning of this year. If you allow me, Madam President, to conclude with a plea, with a request. Because I think that we are at a truly historic European moment where we need – all of us – to show clear political leadership. We would very much appreciate the strong support of the European Parliament, as Mr González Pons has highlighted. But we also need your help to convince your compatriots back home. Therefore, I’m also addressing this request towards the Council and towards the Member States, because we need a good decision. We need a quick decision, and of course we need to work very closely with all national parliaments as well, because in the end, when we are talking about the head-rooms, ceilings and own resources, we need also the positive ratification of the national parliaments. Therefore, what we need is true political leadership, which would help Europe to overcome the crisis and really to prepare it for the next phase. So my last sentence would be directed to all of us: let’s do this effort for the European Union. Let’s do it for the next generation, and let’s do it to demonstrate to our citizens that we know how to overcome the crisis and how we can prepare Europe for the 21st century.

As I said in my opening intervention, the Council has started preparatory work on the Commission proposals so as to create the conditions for the agreement as soon as possible. As I already mentioned, yesterday, in a video conference, the EU affairs ministers, have discussed the principles and the elements that needed to be addressed in shaping the instruments that will help to kick-start the European economy and achieve its medium and long-term priorities, such as cohesion, convergence, solidarity, flexibility and inclusiveness, as well as restoring a functioning single market and strengthening the resilience and strategic autonomy of the EU in face of future challenges. They stressed the need to make the funds available immediately and in a sufficient amount. Offsetting the immediate negative impact of the crisis is important for the EU’s credibility. These discussions will continue in the coming days and weeks at all Council levels. We are hopeful that the Member States’ positions would be converging in order to have a timely agreement on the next EU budget, which will also be discussed by the European Council. The Council will need guidance from the European Council before it can form its position.

We see here on the big stage the three fragments that make up this EU: breach of treaty, law and trust! Recovery bonds are only a relabelling of Eurobonds under the guise of the COVID-19 crisis, with a certain limitation of liability; but it takes effect immediately. Germany must pay 27% of the 500 billion reconstruction fund, a proud 135 billion. Unlike Eurobonds, where Member States are only claimed by defaulting on guarantees, recovery bonds require the Member State to pay interest and repay its share directly. In the medium term, therefore, German public debt is directly increasing. The Germans are already very hard hit. No country has taken in more refugees, which it aliments with social benefits, no country pays more child benefit to other EU countries, sometimes even regardless of whether the children actually exist there.

The updated budget is projected to increase to 2% of EU GNI and amount to EUR 1.1 trillion. The Reconstruction Fund is planned at EUR 750 billion. This is certainly more than proposed by France and Germany (EUR 500 billion), but still much less than requested by Parliament in its resolution of 15 May (EUR 2 trillion).  In this context, difficult negotiations between The Member States in the Council should undoubtedly be expected, but I am convinced that Parliament will be principled in its efforts to maintain the planned expenditure at a level that corresponds at least to the proposal put forward by the Commission. He will probably use the key Treaty power of the budgetary procedure (consent) for this purpose.  The Commission Communication also highlights the proposed way of financing the enlarged budget and the Reconstruction Fund.
