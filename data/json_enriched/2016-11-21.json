The CETA treaty is a large and far-reaching treaty with very far-reaching consequences for our regulations, our decision-making, our legal system, the precautionary principle and our economy. In particular, the Investment Court System (ICS) is a highly controversial part of the treaty. During a public consultation in 2005, its predecessor, the Investor-State Dispute Settlement System (ISDS) received 150,000 responses, 97 percent of which were markedly critical. Some of those errors have been corrected in the investment court system, but essentially ICS is the same system as ISDS. This has been argued by a number of leading scientists, including Canadian professor Gus Van Harten, and has also been demonstrated in a study entitled “Investment Court System put to the test” by a number of leading NGOs. They have shown that the most controversial ISDS cases under ICS can still be conducted with the same or an even worse outcome.

In this context, the biggest reassurance we can have for the future is the ECB’s safe pair of hands. ECB policies have been correct in general terms, and tomorrow I hope this Chamber will clearly endorse them, as we did in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) some weeks ago. ECB policies are subject to improvement and critique, of course. In this report you will find several ideas that may be of interest to you. We believe, for instance, that the asset purchase programmes (APP) should be redirected away from buying public debt into investment assets related to the EIB. The ECB should try harder to buy assets, such as a new wave of project bonds related to EU projects with clear EU added value, for example assets related to the building of the trans-European network of energy and transport, which is fundamental for the economy of the eurozone but lacking in proper investment in some Member States. These European projects related to the Energy Union and the Transport Union were voted through by a large majority in this Parliament during the last legislature. We need investment, but smart investment: no more airports without planes; no more high speed trains without passengers; no more roads without trucks or cars. I believe that the current APP is being used by some Member States to avoid necessary reforms in the fields of late payments, energy reform and public deficits. We also ask the ECB to study how it would impact the European monetary policy if Member States issued debt directly related to public investment so that the ECB could buy it. This may give incentives to Member States to increase their level of investment in research and education. We are also worried about the effects of negative interest rates in our banks and in our economy if they are maintained in the medium term. We know that the ECB is aware of these downside risks. I hope that negative interest rates will be the first measure to be unwound. We express also our concerns in the report on the creation of housing bubbles in many big cities in Europe, such as Barcelona, where I come from. The cities are more and more expensive due to international capital inflows. Ultra-low interest rates are partly responsible for it together with, of course, local mistakes. Income inequalities are also worryingly on the rise. Finally, we call on the ECB to study in depth how small saving banks and big banks react differently during the crisis on the concession of new credit. So we ask: are healthy and well-managed, small saving banks a key part of the rapid recoveries in some countries of the eurozone? I also ask myself in this Chamber, do we need to balance concentration at the big bank level, which is happening in some Member States, with a new wave of small banks linked directly to their local territories?

Ex—post assessment of the ECB’s activities by the European Parliament is an important part of the democratic accountability of the ECB and a necessary complement to its independence. The ECB’s independence in the conduct of its monetary policy, as enshrined in the Treaties, is crucial to the objective of safeguarding price stability. The Commission shares the view that the ECB’s unconventional monetary policy actions have had a positive impact on overall financing conditions in the euro area. The implementation of the measures previously announced by the ECB is expected to lead to further gradual improvements in financial conditions and help bring inflation closer to the ECB’s objective of keeping inflation rates below, but close to, 2% in the medium term. However, we also share this Parliament’s view that a prolonged period of low, or even negative, interest rates represents a challenge for the European financial system. While low interest rates are necessary to support the recovery and have had some positive impact in the short term on financing costs and capital gains for banks, a protracted environment of very low or negative interest rates would be a symptom of persistently weak aggregate demand and overall macroeconomic conditions. As emphasised by Mario Draghi a number of times, we cannot ensure a sustainable recovery with monetary tools only. EU Member States must make wise use of the time provided by an accommodating monetary policy and advance necessary structural reforms, while continuing with responsible fiscal policy. Moreover, within the European Systemic Risk Board we have worked hard to assess the financial stability risks that may arise from a prolonged period of low interest rates. We are aware of the risk that this poses both to banks’ business models through depressed net interest income and for insurers and pension funds with fixed liabilities. We have policy measures in place to address the most severe risks and are continuing to monitor developments in this issue. I look forward to a fruitful debate.

The economic and financial problems in the EU cannot be solved by the monetary policy measures of the ECB alone. Their aim is to stimulate overall demand. Mario Draghi is right: we need balanced structural reforms and sound budget management in all euro area Member States. Cyprus, Ireland and Slovenia are good examples. They were able to reduce their deficits below the reference value of 3% of GDP. This is exactly how positive, sustainable economic and financial development emerges. In 2015 the ECB expanded its asset purchase program. 1.7 trillion euros are earmarked for this by March 2017. This now also includes bonds from non-financial companies, as well as from local and regional authorities. An overly expansionary monetary policy harbors dangers. I consider all the concerns justified that there may be distortions of competition if bonds from large companies are bought on the capital market and the SMEs do not participate sufficiently. In addition, the ongoing low interest rate policy is putting a strain on the future of pension systems. Another problem is that longer-term savings rates in some Member States are below the respective inflation rate. On the other hand, the extraordinary actions of the ECB with the aim of raising the rate of inflation to 2% are to be welcomed. They are lawful, they are consistent with their mandate. Yes, there is no doubt that lending to households and businesses in the euro area has improved.

Probably this report, as I was saying, clearly supports the main measures that the ECB has been taking aimed at achieving the inflation target, which is the main purpose of the European Central Bank. Because we really are still far from the goal, even with all the expansionary measures we have taken, and, therefore, we encourage and, somehow, illuminate some ways to improve access to credit for SMEs, as one of our colleagues said that they spoke previously: how small and medium-sized companies could also have a place within the monetary expansion programs of the ECB. But the report also clearly says that monetary policy alone does not work, that it is true that we need to carry out structural reforms in some sectors, and mainly in banking, because European banking, and in some countries putting greater difficulties, continues to restrict the ability to that the credit reaches all the companies and all the consumers. But apart from that reform, we need a serious fiscal policy. In the next few days we will see the annual growth report prepared by the Commission, and here is Commission Vice-President Dombrovskis, who must shed light on what fiscal policy should be. This fiscal policy has to clearly accompany monetary policy, because when rates are so low, when private investors have no certainty about their profitability because growth forecasts are very low, because really the environment in which Europe is operating is a very uncertain environment, we need the public sector to do its job. And, therefore, we need the public sector, which is ultimately the one who bears the risks in a society, to be able to boost demand to also facilitate the fulfillment of the inflation target by the European Central Bank. And therefore, in the coming months, within the framework of the European Semester as well, we will have to define what that policy should be, which does not just have to be a country-by-country approach, but there has to be a holistic approach to the policy. macro, of fiscal policy, which accompanies the monetary policy implemented by the European Central Bank, with a reasonable result in a very complex environment, as I said before. In any case, these last seconds I would like to dedicate to continue insisting on the need for the benefits of the European Central Bank, that the benefits of the only federal institution, the institution of the Union's currency, which is the euro, return to the budget of the Union as a whole.

I am happy to be back at the European Parliament to discuss with you the European Central Bank Annual Report for 2015. This debate is an important pillar of our accountability. We take your comments and suggestions very seriously. At your request, last year, we began publishing the ECB’s feedback on your resolution on the ECB Annual Report. On 4 October 2016, the Governing Council also approved principles increasing transparency in developing ECB regulations on European statistics. These principles take into account the transparency practices of the European Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the Commission. In my remarks today, I will retrace the economic developments since our last plenary exchange in February. In particular, I will discuss the role of the ECB’s monetary policy in supporting the ongoing recovery. I will also review the policy agenda aimed at addressing current vulnerabilities in the euro area. Let me say a few words now about economic developments and the role of the ECB’s monetary policy in supporting the recovery. The euro area recovery continues to proceed at a moderate but steady pace. It has shown remarkable resilience to adverse developments and uncertainties emanating from the global environment. In fact, euro area unemployment has been steadily declining. More than four million jobs have been created since 2013, when the situation was at its worst. Domestic demand has also strengthened and positive figures for real GDP growth have been recorded for 14 consecutive quarters. Since the beginning of the year, headline inflation has gradually picked up, moving from the negative rate of -0.2% in February to +0.5% in October. Our monetary policy measures since June 2014 have been a key factor behind these positive developments. Asset purchases, targeted longer-term refinancing operations (TLTROs, as they are called) and low policy rates have strongly supported the recovery. Let me explain more in detail. First, the pass-through of our monetary stimulus to bank lending conditions has been remarkable. Interest rates have fallen markedly across a broad spectrum of asset classes and credit markets since June 2014. As a result, euro area firms and households have experienced more favourable borrowing conditions. For example, bank lending rates for companies declined by more than 100 basis points between June 2014 and September 2016. Bank lending conditions for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) – the backbone of our economy – have improved even more. Since May 2014, bank lending rates on very small loans to corporations have declined by around 170 basis points. They are now converging towards those on loans to large-scale borrowers. Evidence from our bank-lending survey supports this picture. Banks report that our measures are contributing to more favourable terms and conditions on loans and are supporting credit creation. Moreover, we see that banks are passing on the very attractive funding conditions of the TLTROs to their customers. Lower borrowing costs for firms and households have stimulated both consumption and investment. For example, household income is benefiting from lower interest-rate expenses. Likewise, investment spending benefits from lower financing costs, which are making more investment projects profitable. Supported by our monetary policy, the recovery is sustaining its momentum. We also expect headline inflation to continue rising over the coming months. At the same time, we are not seeing a consistent strengthening of underlying price dynamics. Much of the expected increase will be driven by statistical factors related to the stabilisation of oil prices. Moreover, the return of inflation towards our objective still relies on the continuation of the current, unprecedented level of monetary support, in spite of the gradual closing of the output gap. It is for this reason that we remain committed to preserving the very substantial degree of monetary accommodation necessary to secure a sustained convergence of inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. However, as your draft resolution on our Annual Report argues, our monetary policy support has to be accompanied by decisive action from other policy areas. In fact, we continue to face a number of structural challenges that are holding back a more dynamic expansion of the euro area economy. So the right policies need to be designed to address existing vulnerabilities and challenges and, ultimately, to secure higher sustainable growth for the euro area. As I argued before, the euro area economy has proved resilient despite the uncertainty caused, among other things, by the crisis in emerging market economies, the collapse in oil and commodity prices, and the consequences of the UK referendum. Beyond the relevance of the ECB’s monetary policy, an important contributing factor has been the more robust financial sector which has emerged from the financial crisis. The decision to address the mistakes of the pre-crisis era through ambitious regulatory reforms is thus paying off. It has resulted in a European financial sector that is now stronger in terms of capital, leverage, funding and risk-taking. For example, Common Equity Tier 1 ratios in the euro area have improved substantially, rising from less than 7% for significant banking groups in 2008 to more than 14% today. The welcome improvements in bank solvency – and the related improvement in asset quality – are a tangible result of our common work to create the Banking Union. The comprehensive assessment we conducted in 2014 – together with a deep asset quality review – encouraged banks to strengthen their balance sheets without delay. As a result, while the level of non-performing loans (NPLs) remains high in some countries, today this problem is not primarily related to the robustness of balance sheets. Coverage ratios are close to 50% and much of the remainder is collateralised. A more resilient euro area banking system has been able to respond to the impetus originated by our monetary policy and facilitate the recovery in credit we have witnessed so far. However, a number of structural factors are still weighing on the ability of the financial sector to fully support the euro area recovery. Notably, the profitability of euro area banks remains a challenge to be addressed. While bank profitability and the level of bank equity prices is not, per se, a matter for policymakers, insofar as it raises financing costs for banks, it could ultimately curtail lending to the real economy and hold back the recovery. We should therefore consider what factors are behind this and what we can do to address them. One factor is certainly the low-growth and low-inflation environment, which translates into low interest rates. By supporting the recovery, our monetary policy measures are supporting a return towards higher rates of return. In other words, low interest rates today are necessary for a return to higher interest rates in the future. But legacy and structural challenges are also important factors behind banks’ low profitability. Where profitability is being affected by structural issues, such as overcapacity and inefficient cost structures, rationalisation and consolidation must form part of the answer. Where the non-performing loans (NPLs) are at a high level, creating the conditions for a faster resolution of bad loans is an essential part of the solution. ECB Banking Supervision has presented its draft guidance on NPLs for public consultation. We have also conducted a stocktake of national supervisory practices and legal frameworks related to NPLs. With a view to creating liquid markets of distressed debt, efforts will be required to foster the development of an NPL servicing industry, to improve data quality and access, and to remove tax and legal impediments to debt restructuring. The European Parliament also has an important role to play in a number of key legislative dossiers. Some relate to the Banking Union, with the proposed European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the introduction of ‘risk-reduction’ measures in the context of the upcoming revision of the legislative pillars of the Single Rulebook for banks – namely the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD), the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR) and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD). Others relate to the Capital Markets Union (CMU). In particular, the negotiations concerning the Securitisation Regulation need to be finalised soon. Securitisation can play a very important role in increasing bank funding to the economy but regulatory uncertainty is detrimental to European securitisation markets. We consider that the Commission has put forward a strong package that balances a revival of the European securitisation markets with the preservation of a prudent regulatory framework. Progress needs to be made in other areas too, in particular insolvency law and taxation, as announced in the Commission’s communication. It will also be necessary to address the financial stability aspects of CMU as part of the macroprudential review. A stable, profitable and competitive financial sector is essential for sustainable economic growth; but the reverse is also true. This is why we need more decisive action to raise the potential growth rate of the economy. First, let me echo your draft resolution. The implementation of structural reforms needs to be substantially stepped up. This concerns, in particular, policy actions to raise productivity and improve the business environment. We will soon discuss the Annual Growth Survey 2017, which touches upon these exact issues. We should make the best use of the annual cycle of economic governance by ensuring that recommendations – including euro area recommendations – are really taken into account and effectively implemented. Second, fiscal policies should also support the economic recovery, while remaining in compliance with the fiscal rules of the European Union. For instance, a more growth-friendly composition of fiscal policies could boost growth. This leads me to my concluding point. During our last plenary exchange in February, I said that the cohesion of Europe was being tested. Since then, the challenges have increased. It is now, more than ever, important and necessary that Europe responds cohesively and decisively to the challenges it is facing. I believe we should remember the words of a great European, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, spoken in this room more than ten years ago: ‘If we act alone we will be at the mercy of events bigger than us, events that threaten peace and European security.’ I am confident that the foundations on which the EU project is built are strong enough to achieve the objectives that have been entrusted to us by the people of Europe. I am now looking forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 21, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Bernd LUCKE", "mepid": "124820", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. -  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen! First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur very much for his report. And I would like to thank Mr Draghi for doing me the honor of appearing in the European Parliament just in time for my speech. I am also delighted, Mr Draghi, that you have said that you want to take what I am saying in my speech very seriously. Because the euro, Mr Draghi, is still in a serious crisis. And if you want to know how grave this crisis is, all you have to do is read this report that Mr Tremosa i Balcells wrote. He points out exactly the difficulties that exist in the euro area. It has already been stated several times in this debate that there is a great deal not right economically and fiscally in the eurozone. Despite all the measures that the European Central Bank has taken, we have nothing but distortions in the markets. But we have not made any progress in terms of productivity and competitiveness. We now have negative interest rates. And, Mr Draghi, you praise it by saying: Now households have more money to spend because they no longer have to pay so much interest. But the truth is that you are destroying a culture of saving and that with negative interest rates you are promoting a culture of debt. And that's the opposite of what we need. As has been stated, they are destroying private pension provision. Mr Draghi, in the 1990s I took out pension insurance for myself, for which the insurance company promised me a 4% guaranteed interest rate. How is this poor insurance company supposed to generate 4% guaranteed interest if you push interest rates into the zero range or even into the negative range? And at the same time we have these distortions, and at the same time we see the mortgage bubbles, the real estate bubbles, carried out by Mr. Tremosa i Balcells.We see rents rising in the big cities, we see the increase in inequality between those who have wealth, whose assets soar, and those who do not.I am really not on the left in this House, but, Mr Draghi, these are distributional effects that we really did not want as a result of central bank policy.One last word on the debate that has taken place within the EPP: the European Central Bank is not a ministry for the economy and it is not responsible for reducing youth unemployment.I strongly disagree.The European Central Bank has a mandate, and that mandate is monetary policy.And it cannot do more than monetary policy.But unfortunately she has exceeded this mandate by far.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 22, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Fabio DE MASI", "mepid": "124858", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Madam President, President Draghi, dear Ramon! Nothing is good in the euro area, especially not for the unemployed young people in Portugal, Greece or Spain that Mr Lucke mentioned. After the crisis, the USA implemented an expansive fiscal policy and recapitalized banks under state control. In Europe, banks have been bailed out for free and public investments, wages and pensions have been cut. The ECB has therefore missed its inflation target for years. The cheap money ends up in the financial markets, not in the real economy, because banks hardly grant loans because of bad papers and insufficient investment. The repackaging of scrap loans via the Capital Markets Union is absurd, however, because it is not about the middle class, it is about sweeping the bad papers off the balance sheets and passing them on like hot potatoes. But financial stability and growth are not a contradiction in terms. It was the financial crisis that brought us a lost decade. Deutsche Bank continues to be the most dangerous bank in the world, Italian banks have significant problems, and insurers are also a systemic risk. That is why we need public investment to normalize interest rate policy. It was just a mistake to force so many people into private old-age provision.

The ECB has to support public investments because the German government continues to violate the rules of the game with its current account surpluses of 8% of GDP.

First of all, let me thank the rapporteur for the report for the work he has done. It is true that you, Mr Draghi, have had to face a situation of absolute paralysis on the part of the Member States, of an absolutely suicidal austerity policy, and it is you who have been forced to maintain a line of salvation , a lifeline for European economies through the development of unconventional policies. Obviously, that has not been enough for you to reach the inflation target set by the European Central Bank itself, which, I believe - we have said that many times in this House - that with the time that we have not reached that level inflation rate (2%), perhaps the Council should start to review it, since it has the power to do so. But it is true that you have been faced with fiscal inaction. And we see with concern - and my group is also concerned - that, after the European Commission's proposal to have a somewhat expansive fiscal policy next year - a little more than this year's fiscal position - the reaction of some Member States it has been to say \"no\" from the start; not only that of the German federal government but, surprisingly, also of the Spanish economy minister - surprisingly, I mean, because it would be one of the countries that would be most interested. And that is the situation that you have had to face and, from this point of view, I believe that the Member States bear a great deal of responsibility for the situation we are in. It seemed to me to understand that, in the medium term, you consider that the stimuli should not be withdrawn. Some member of the Governing Council has also said it this week. My group shares that - it seems to us to be premature. But I also have to tell you that the monetary stimuli have generated certain risky situations that are very worrying and that you cannot delay in facing them. It is evident that we have - there are many studies that point to this - problems with the impact that unconventional measures can have on inequality because, obviously, holders of financial assets benefit from the implicit subsidies that their policy implies in relation to the banking, implicit subsidies to large corporations. We had the opportunity to discuss that in the last appearance in the Economic Commission: you are buying bonds from large corporations that do not need help. It would be much more interesting if, together with, for example, the European Investment Bank, channels were created so that quantitative expansion could directly finance certain social and environmental projects, something that is installed in the public debate and that is extremely positive. Property bubbles have also been mentioned, I think it is also an obvious risk. And then, there is another thing that I want to talk to you about and that concerns us especially, which also has to do with the Bank's democratic control: it seems to us that in some of its instruments, you, as the Governing Council, have such discretion in apply the rules that has become a real democratic problem. And since we are - because this report is from 2015 - I have to talk about the emergency liquidity line, in which you, in even situations, have applied totally different policies and decisions. In the case of Cyprus, being the bank insolvent, the regulator saying that the bank was insolvent, you decided to maintain the emergency liquidity line, and in the case of Greece, on the other hand, without having said the supervisor that the bank was insolvent , you decided to cut it. Why? To this day, no one knows yet. And now I have to tell you that these kinds of things damage the credibility of the European Central Bank.They should clarify the rules of the emergency liquidity line.It seems to me a central question because, if not, the democratic credibility of the bank is at stake.I also say this because in the case of Greece - and since we are in 2015, it must also be said - the decisions that you took many times were too parallel to the decisions taken by the Eurogroup.And that too, somehow, put the Bank's reputation as an independent entity at risk.I believe that these things are lessons from which we have to learn and I hope, in any case, that many of the concerns that unconventional monetary policy measures generate today will be addressed and solved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 24, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Marco VALLI", "mepid": "124778", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I am a little disappointed, as every year, by the European Central Bank report because we miss a great opportunity to highlight, with a little intellectual honesty, what the economic and monetary situation is. We are witnessing a failure for European citizens, which is evident, because in terms of employment and in terms of economic development we have been at a standstill for several years, facing great deals for those who are currently buying the Member States at a discount price. . This is because, obviously, thanks to the policies applied through the euro and through the intrinsic austerity that exists in this project, there are cuts in public investments, wage devaluations to compensate for the system's inability to be able to balance imbalances existing, because we have blocked exchange rates and therefore wages are devalued and the policies of the jobs act simply imply making people poorer to make the Eurozone competitive. Here, this is a project that objectively cannot work in these terms and obviously those who want to speculate and privatize everything that is state property take advantage of it. And for this reason it is an unsustainable and also unreformable project. The euro zone will never be an optimal currency space, precisely because there are no prerequisites: if we go to read the books of all the greatest economists in the world, including Stiglitz, we realize how this cannot be proposed as a project. Therefore, there cannot be a single monetary policy for 19 countries and not even for 27 or 28, when the conditions are not right for it. And why? Because there are different needs in terms of interest rates and inflation rates.

Your credo is to always buy more securities and debt to save financial markets and European private banks in difficulty, but nothing is being done to revive the productive economy in the euro area. The straitjacket of your \"single euro currency\" forces economies to undergo an aberrant monetary policy which is anything but optimal, since all rates are divergent in the euro zone. This is economic heresy and some savvy economists even call you an arsonist. European countries must be given back control of their monetary tool so that they adapt the parity of their currency to the characteristics and needs of their national economy. The UK does, as does Switzerland. We must also give back to European countries the supervision of their national banking system. In short, we must return to national economic governance \"whatever the cost\", to use your expression.

Any reduction in unemployment that you are referring to, Mr Draghi, means a generalization of flexible work. Competition within the European Union over the European Central Bank's management mix and monetary policy is not in the public interest, but in business groups trying to strengthen their position to the detriment of their competitors in the field of anemic growth in eurozone and the European Union. The Greek government's premise to close the second assessment, to extract a form of debt extension and to join the measures of the European Central Bank presupposes new barbaric anti-popular measures, possibly, and a fourth memorandum in Greece.

I also think that its main message, at least from my point of view, is that we probably are at a turning point. Timid recovery fails to gather momentum. It is true that the political events of the past months have not helped to foster confidence and stability. It is true that monetary policy has done a lot to preserve and enhance this fragile growth, but it seems that unconventional monetary policy is reaching its limits, and the ECB has in fact been in charge of coping with most parts of the post-crisis adjustment. As President Draghi stressed earlier this year, half of the growth we have witnessed is due to the exceptional monetary policy that has been put in place. But this alone cannot solve the problem of imbalances; it cannot solve the problem of huge debt overhang. The quantitative easing seems to blur the line between monetary and fiscal policy. It might not be stimulating other adjustments – fiscal and structural – needed to resolve impediments to put the economy on a more robust growth path.  We also know that even though this policy’s benefits have so far outweighed the costs, there are negative side effects to it which are well outlined in the report. Whatever it takes in terms of ECB action, I hope that it does not make the leaders continue to think ‘why should we bother?’ We must continue to emphasise that the last bell is indeed ringing for fiscal policy, for public investment and for private investment to take it over. I also believe that the proposals in the context of the Capital Markets Union look very promising as tools stimulating growth policy.  The results of some studies also suggest that monetary policy might no longer be able to be the same in the future, with real interest rates lower than in the decades preceding the crisis. Whatever it will be, monetary policy will remain fundamentally important for the eurozone in the future, and the ECB will continue to be on the front line. There are still many black swans out there ready to test our cohesion and resilience.

Basically, the examination of the annual report of the Central Bank is also the moment to take stock of the balance of the European policy mix and this is indeed the direction of the debate which has just started. Mr President, you have said how much this unconventional policy of the Central Bank had made it possible to support the activity of the Union and, as you know, this Parliament, with the report by Mr Tremosa i Balcells, supports the maintenance of this unconventional activity of your bank in order to support both demand and the return of inflation in Europe. But, for all that, including on the monetary side, it is clear that a certain number of things still need to be examined and improved. First, the issue of non-performing loans. At some point, I think we will have to ask ourselves whether, beyond the work done by supervisors, we need or not a framework for European reflection or action. Regarding my second question, you once again mentioned the overcapacity, the need for rationality or the insufficiencies in terms of profitability in the banking sector. It is a track on which you now regularly insist and on which we will have to come back. Finally, you mentioned the issue of banking union.

It is perhaps the only central bank that has extended its mandate to become a de facto political body, but without any democratic control, which is perhaps the intention behind all of this. That evolution is logical. Where a normal central bank is an instrument of a political government, the central bank operates in the euro zone, a zone that actually has no political authority. It operates in a zone where political authority is somehow reconstructed or the appearance of it is created by a stability pact, a European Semester, a banking union, a deposit insurance scheme and the like. In this way they try to compensate for the fact that in that eurozone, in the European Union, there is no political authority with which one could justify a unity of a currency. Keeping that vehicle on track, along with all the money you put into it, along with the funds that go for it, a vehicle that is doomed to crash from the start, keeping that track is the phase in which we now find ourselves with an ECB that has become increasingly part of the political mandate it has given, which it has actually given itself.

With the \"no\" in the referendum of July 2015, he clarified that he radically disagrees with the economic policies of the Union. Ensuring the viability of the euro has led to unemployment, business destruction, poverty and misery. The referendum order, however, was not implemented by the left-wing Tsipras government. Thus the financial pressure of the European Central Bank and the inhuman attitude of the Commission have trampled on the dignity of a proud people. This report confirms the crisis of the Greeks.

The main theme of the euro area in 2015 was economic recovery, although unfortunately this is still not the same in all countries. Some succeeded more, others a little less. In addition, as has been repeatedly pointed out, we are plagued by low inflation and very low interest rates. This, of course, is a very big cause for concern. We all emphasize this. This policy has produced results, but it does not necessarily continue to produce them. If these measures are not combined with some other measures, then we cannot hope for success. I am pleased that we are dealing with this report relatively quickly already this calendar year. And what we need to emphasize, and we all emphasize: that, in addition to these monetary measures, we also need structural measures. Economic growth, which has also been helped by central bank measures, may have put us to sleep a little too much, and some countries are now not making enough effort to make much-needed structural reforms, especially in the area of ​​pensions, in the face of such low economic growth. The demographic situation will not be better tomorrow, but it will be worse. It is precisely because of such a policy pursued by the European Central Bank that our pension funds are also in danger. However, I would like to point out one more thing: the European Central Bank can, of course, influence the credibility of all the microsystems we have in Europe through its actions, within its competences. We have not done our homework everywhere and in many countries, including my country Slovenia, we are still dealing with the consequences of rescuing the banking system, caused either by deliberately fraudulent acts or not by entrepreneurial ... non-entrepreneurial activities. I am therefore pleased that Mr Draghi also spoke about the draft guidelines for bad loans.

It is hardly contestable that, in the face of the unprecedented scenario of low growth, low inflation, low level of the natural interest rate, the extraordinary monetary policy measures implemented by the ECB were decisive in preserving the euro area from deflation and contributing to the economic recovery in progress. To those who wonder about their risks and their negative implications, it is good to remember that the monetary policy of the ECB is not the cause of low interest rates but is the symptom and the necessary - if not the only - therapy. Given the moderate pace of the recovery and its exposure to the downside risks deriving from the current phase of political and economic uncertainty, it is clear that a continuation of the current expansionary nature of monetary policy will be necessary to ensure a return of the inflation rate. below, but close, at 2%. At the same time, it is equally clear that this action, while necessary, is not enough. We must therefore make better and stronger use of the economic policy instruments we have. We are facing the risk of a vicious circle between expectations of low growth and low investments, which can also have a negative impact on potential growth, making the effect of the crisis structural and not just cyclical. This scenario is aggravated by the uncertainties of the political framework and by the possible pursuit of a line of economic unilateralism by the new American administration. For this it is necessary to make our policy a more growth-oriented mix of structural reforms and fiscal policies, in particular by supporting public and private investment and strengthening social and territorial cohesion.In this sense, the Commission's recommendation of a moderately expansionary fiscal stance constitutes an important step forward which now needs to be translated into concrete actions and instruments.The European Parliament will not fail to have its voice in this debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 36, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Stanisław OŻÓG", "mepid": "124897", "text": "- Madam President!I am glad that the report presents a moderately critical approach by the European Parliament to the response to the ECB report, especially as regards maintaining negative interest rates.In my opinion, however, this is not enough.I cannot vote in favor of a report that accepts and welcomes the ECB's policy of defending the euro at all costs, using such unconventional means as, among other things, an asset purchase program.I would simply call it printing money.I am also concerned about the call to complete the banking union and the capital markets agreements, which, in short, pose a serious threat not only to countries in the euro area.I am surprised that this is not the case.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 37, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Beatrix von STORCH", "mepid": "124825", "text": "Madam President, Mr Draghi!

Let me just present to you a few scattered observations. First of all, this is the first year when the GDP of the euro area has returned to the level of before the crisis. It has taken us seven and a half years. So if we look back, things are better today than they were before. That is the first statement of fact that we should collectively keep in mind. And all this in spite of the serious geopolitical risks that are maturing and have matured especially this year. Any available evidence suggests that the transmission of our accommodative monetary policy is effective. It has contributed, as I was saying before, to a significant easing in the borrowing conditions for firms and households – not for the large capitalists as such, but for everybody – and our policy has stimulated credit creation, and it is basically supporting the euro area recovery.  There are two surveys. One is the bank lending survey where we asked banks what they are doing with their credit conditions, and they all say they have expanded credit, they have expanded the standards and their costs have been going down considerably for a long time. Then we also asked the Commission for a survey for SMEs, and similar questions were asked revolving around how they felt today with respect to credit conditions. The answers are unambiguously positive. The annual rate of growth of loans to firms has increased from -3% to +2% since May 2014.  Some of your points, and also those in the draft resolution, raised the issue of heterogeneity within the euro area, along with some other points raised before. That also has improved as well. Development in lending rates to non—financial corporations point to a drastic reduction in the fragmentation of bank lending across the euro area, and I can give you all kinds of numbers about that. We have next to the Asset Purchase Programme for the public sector a programme – and it was referred to in some of the interventions – where we buy corporate sector bonds. One lingering worry is that this programme actually benefits large corporates and does not benefit SMEs. Nothing could be further from the truth. SMEs have actually improved their lending conditions a lot. There is one good reason for this, which is that if the large corporates borrow more on the capital markets they will free space in the banks’ balance sheets for SMEs. And, by the way, the corporate bond market has also experienced a significant increase in issuance. So funding costs and better access to finance have improved for both small and large companies, and this has and will have a positive effect on investment.  Having said that, I understand – from your words, of course, but also we are aware – that there are concerns as regards the risks associated with low interest rates and our unconventional measures. Our measures still entail some medium—term risks and have side effects. However, do we see a bubble today? If we look at asset valuations we do not see that their valuations are somewhat high or stretched. Also, any analysis would show that it is not a rise in asset prices per se that can create long-term damage to financial and macroeconomic stability, but it is an asset price boom which is fuelled by excess borrowing and leveraging, and this we do not have.  In summary, financial stability risks related to our monetary policy measures are for the time being contained, but we will certainly watch them closely, and we are certainly aware that they have to be observed and monitored very, very closely. But we should also be aware that the right macroeconomic policy is the best safeguard of financial stability. On the low interest rates let’s be clear: low interest rates are a consequence of low growth and low inflation all over the world. They are not the creation of the ECB. In this situation, as I was saying I think in my introductory remarks, the policy rates by the ECB have to be low in order to stimulate growth and when you have higher growth and higher inflation, the policy rates of the ECB will also increase. By and large so far, the negative rate situation, when we weigh up benefits and costs, we see that the benefits are bigger than the costs. Of course, there are many different considerations here, and you have all kinds of actors, but the impact of recent monetary policy measures on bank profitability so far has been contained. We are aware that this is not going to be forever. In the medium term, negative interest rates will certainly create a negative effect on banks’ profitability.  On the economic outlook, as I have communicated before, at our next monetary policy meeting in early December we will assess the inflation outlook and our monetary policy stance. Our assessment in December will benefit from the new staff projections extending up to 2019, and we will also take stock of the work of the eurosystem committees on the options that ensure a smooth implementation of our purchase programme until March 2017 or beyond, if necessary. We are committed to preserving an accommodative monetary policy stance that is necessary to bring inflation towards levels below, but close to, 2% over the medium term. And we are also committed to act if warranted by using all the instruments available within our mandate to achieve our objective. Of course, other policies should also play a role, and I have commented on these several times in the past.  Let me now address some of the points – unfortunately in quite a scattered way – but, first of all, our monetary policy is by and large similar to the monetary policy that has been pursued in the United States, in the United Kingdom and in Japan. The policies of the large central banks do not differ very much today. Second, the Troika. There isn’t any sentence by any court that forbids the ECB to be in the Troika. It is true that, over the years, in the last two or three years, the ECB has carved itself, in a sense, a much narrower role in the Troika, closer to our own specificity – namely the financial sector and the banking sector. It does not have as much of a voice as it used to in the past on the macroeconomic programmes, where it is the Commission which is the predominant voice. , I have already addressed the point that the large corporates benefit from our programmes while the SMEs do not. On our mandate, some of the statements were saying either explicitly or implicitly that we are overstepping our mandate. Well, we went to court and that is not the view of the European Court of Justice. Our policies generate inequality? That is not what the data shows. The creation of four million jobs has done more for reducing inequality than anything else. It is true that when the central banks’ buy assets, asset prices go up and the owners of the assets are usually wealthy, and you may have a worsening of distribution in the short term, but then the effect upon employment and upon economic activity reduces the major sources of inequality, which is unemployment, and that is what has happened in the euro area, where we have basically created four million jobs.  A point was raised on ELA which, by the way, is the prerogative of the national competent authorities – in this case, the national central banks of Cyprus and Greece – and this emergency liquidity assistance has to comply with the monetary financing prohibition laid down in Article 123 of the Treaty. So the ELA decisions have not violated any of these principles. They did not violate the Treaty and they were taken in a fair and uniform way across countries and across time.  On Ireland, we had a dedicated hearing on Ireland in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Policy and any MEP can ask us any question in writing and we always answer. So if there are questions about Ireland, on UniCredit and so on, please send us the question and we will answer it.  I think I have answered most of the questions. Some of you raised the point of what the consequence of the US elections will be on our outlook. It is really very difficult to assess what the impact of this change will be on our economic policy and on the economic outlook of the euro area, but in general – and we have seen this with the outcome of the UK referendum – we had a reaction in the markets in both cases which at the beginning was pretty significant, but then it became muted and markets have shown their resilience thanks also, especially in the first case, to the preparation of the Bank of England on the one side, and the European Central Bank on the other. But I do not think we should stop at that. Clearly these changes have a long-term impact which is very difficult to assess, and in the case of the UK it will depend on the shape of the final negotiation and the length of time it will take to find an agreement.

I have to say that it has not been easy because, on the one side, there are MEPs asking for helicopter money and, on the other side, there are MEPs regretting that there are increasing worries about negative interest rates, bubbles and rising inequalities. I think that tomorrow we can give clear support to the policies instead of all the concerns that we have heard and to which you replied very well, Mr Draghi, in your second answer. I wanted to make a final call especially to the Green Group – though I do not see any MEPs from the Green Group in this House now – which has always been pro—European. In recent years they were all on board, with a big majority of this House, in supporting ECB policies. Populism is currently on the rise everywhere, including in various countries in the eurozone. The Green Group has always been pro—European and many of the points and amendments by the Green Group have been included in the final compromises.

Here the ECB used a loophole in its statute to buy massive amounts of government bonds on the secondary market. However, regardless of the partial economic successes of QE in Japan and the United States, it turns out that monetary policy also has limits. Because monetary policy alone cannot help overcome underlying structural, economic problems and inequalities. The problem with QE remains that states no longer feel any pressure to implement necessary structural reforms, which means that the signals from the European Commission, the Troika / Quadriga and the monetary policy environment are in contradiction to one another.

I would like to begin by thanking the party groups, who have been very cooperative and enabled us to reach a broad consensus in an area that will become more important over time, namely how we can create the conditions for a single market for financial services. for individuals and small businesses. I would like to emphasize that I welcome the Commission's Green Paper. It has come at just the right time. Due to significant border barriers, cross-border trade in financial services is still undeveloped. It is bad for consumers, inhibiting for innovative companies and disrupting the functioning of the European economy. Therefore, we need to work to unleash the full potential of that market and support innovative solutions that can benefit consumers. A large part of the financial services today are linked to 28 different markets, which are characterized by low competition and a lack of global competitiveness. If the power of digitalisation is used properly, a European regulatory system can strengthen the individual consumer and contribute to a better financial product at lower prices. It is a golden opportunity that we must not miss. A larger part of the payments are now made digitally. Here we need a competition-neutral regulatory framework that ensures that new innovative players can continue to contribute to growth for more jobs in Europe. Legislation needs to ensure that increased competition contributes to real added value for consumers. The most basic rights for citizens, such as the right to open a bank account, need to be strengthened. The financial supervisory authorities need to better monitor how banks and other financial institutions comply with adopted, implemented acts such as PSD II, Mifid and the Money Laundering Directive. I am convinced that in times like these, the EU must concentrate on one of its core missions. We need to break down more barriers so that the free market can move promoted. Therefore, as soon as possible, the Commission needs to present a series of legislative proposals that take into account Parliament's views. A broad set of regulations for financial services within the Union is likely to be an important piece of the puzzle in achieving better mobility among EU citizens. Today, financial actors all too often condition private individuals' consumption of financial services with the requirement of permanent residence. A clear example is that credit cards stop working for some Europeans when they choose to move to another Member State. The Commission should therefore present proposals to address the problem of geoblocking, which is specifically linked to financial services trading. Another challenge is to make the identification work in practice. Today, there are major problems that can be linked to identification and digital financial services. Therefore, the technology for identification needs to be standardized. The interpretation of the Money Laundering Directive must also be fine-tuned to ensure effective identification opportunities. An overall challenge is the issue of financial inclusion. If you as a citizen do not get access to the most basic financial services, life will be very difficult. No matter what measures we take, the issue of financial inclusion must always be at the center. The new Payment Directive will give every citizen the right to a basic bank account. Even if the step is in the right direction, we must not be content. Building a well-functioning internal market for financial services is a comprehensive project. At the same time, it is worth the effort if it creates real added value for Europe's citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 65, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Olle Ludvigsson for his excellent report on retail financial services. Last year the Commission published its Green Paper on that subject. Its title was ‘Better products, more choice, and greater opportunities for consumers and businesses’. Those remain our objectives. We launched a consultation to ask consumers and businesses for their thoughts on how to achieve them. The responses are shaping our approach to deepening the single market for these services so as to enable consumers to make informed purchases that meet their needs wherever they might be in Europe and to allow financial firms to make the most of economies of scale, lower costs and improve service. We received more than 400 responses to our consultation. This underscores the need to tackle some of the barriers to cross-border retail financial services at European level. I am pleased to see that the conclusions of your report go in the same direction. Consumers cannot understand why, in our single market, it is still so difficult to purchase financial products from another Member State, particularly as other services are more easily available. Financial firms can have their ambitions to sell into bigger markets frustrated by additional requirements in different European countries. The Green Paper consultation has now closed. The Commission issued a feedback statement in July and we will follow up with an action plan on retail financial services next year. It will cover a number of areas touched upon in Mr Ludvigsson’s report. The action plan will tackle barriers that consumers face when they want to access financial products at a distance. We want to make it easier for consumers to be identified remotely without weakening important anti-money laundering requirements. We will look into reducing obstacles which financial firms can face when they want to expand into another European country without establishing a physical presence. And we want to give consumers the confidence that they need to purchase products across borders by giving them better access to reliable information and by making sure that they have a right to redress if things go wrong. The work that we are taking forward with a Consumer Financial Services Green Paper is part of our broader push to build a single market for capital in Europe, a capital markets union. Working together we have a real opportunity to strengthen the single market around the principles of transparency, competition and choice, and we can make the daily lives of European consumers easier.

And therefore the Green Paper that you have presented is an opportunity to do three things at the same time: one, to regulate and end the fragmentation that today dominates the markets at European level; two, to empower and protect consumers as well; and three, to seize, for growth, the opportunities of digitization. End fragmentation: but there, Commissioner, we do not believe in good practice or good intentions. We need regulation, that the existing one is fulfilled and that the gaps that it has left are covered. We do not believe, as I say, that it is not necessary to move from the Green Paper to concrete legislative actions that guarantee equal opportunities and also avoid fragmentation between Member States. Empower consumers, through increased transparency, increasing their confidence, the comparability of products, and, for that, we propose a tool that allows comparability between the same products from different Member States, and, fundamentally, agile, fast, safe mechanisms for conflict resolution between different Member States.And third, all of this can be done by promoting, taking advantage of, the opportunities of digitization.But let me just focus on one issue: fintechs.It is also a new opportunity to improve financing at European level, far beyond the abusive bank dependency that we have in the Community area.But for this it is also necessary to better regulate how these operate in monetary loans.We have to establish the same rules, the same protections and requirements that the traditional banking system has for those new operators who take advantage of the new digitalization technologies to open new business fields.New rules and networks, the same opportunities, also with the same safeguards as those we already know in the traditional market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 67, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Gunnar HÖKMARK", "mepid": "28124", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Ludvigsson for this report. It is a very important discussion and very important substance. I think we have every opportunity now to do what we can in order to achieve an efficient and liquid European financial market. Digitalisation means that we will have all these opportunities. It will open things up for the fintech industry and a lot of new services, but it will also create better competition, better credit situations, and better credit opportunities. The challenge for us is to set all these things in the perspective of digitalisation, because while it makes most things possible, we can still see that legislation and regulations are hindrances. I think it is important to see what we can do in order to do what we must do.  First of all, we can create better credit situations all over Europe: liquid markets. Second, we can secure for consumers their being able to use a new range of services in other countries, but also being able to use services from other countries in their own country. You can move from country to country, having your pension with you, but also having the opportunity to pay your invoices which is, by the way, quite important. And you will be able to participate in all the new services, in parallel with banks, competing with banks, but also in innovating financial markets. It will create new jobs, but it will also give a more efficient European economy.  I think, in order to achieve this, that we need to secure an open mind for all the new competition that will arise. That has to do with how we deal with the Payment Service Directive. I think banks will still be as important as they are, but if we can open up new arenas and new opportunities for credit and for financing and new services, we must do that in order to help consumers. I think we need to implement a number of items of legislation that so far are not as implemented as they should be – the Mortgage Credit Directive, taking one example – but also set all the other legislation we have in place.  Digitalisation is not new. It has dominated the financial sector for quite a long time. But the thing that we need to do is to ensure that we facilitate all the opportunities that digitalisation can provide for European financial markets. That is why this discussion is very important.

I believe that my colleague Ludvigsson's report provides a good analysis of your proposals. Basically, the central question now is how to mobilize individual savings and put them at the service of a European strategy which is necessarily a long-term investment strategy. For this, I believe that the proposal we are making for a European savings product must be seriously examined by your Commission. I know that low rates do not create an environment favorable to such a proposal, but you would thus respond, in my opinion, to an aspiration of our fellow citizens and offer a means of finding funding for an investment in favor of the ecological transition. Such progress must also go through the issue of consumer protection, which can never be ignored. From this point of view, I hope that we will be able to quickly lead to this famous PRIIPs legislation on which we are trying to lead. However, we can see it clearly, and this is very significant, the operators of different sectors want to be able to compete with each other to collect savings, but then they do not want us to be able to compare their products in an open and transparent manner. The legislator and the Commission must be very firm in this area. My colleague spoke a lot about FinTech. I am also in favor of FinTech, but I think that, in this area, the supervisors and the European Commission must be very vigilant, because I observe here and there the development of trading platforms which are sometimes pure scams against which the Europe must act by mobilizing more strongly ESMA and the competent national authorities.

As the previous speaker said, this is a very important topic for citizens. This is about everyday products that they use. Everybody has insurances, loans, mortgages, pension savings, investment accounts, etc., but we see that only three percent of the market – three percent of the potential – is being used and that is worrying. But I have to say that what worries me even more is the lack of ambition and the lack of urgency – just look around the room – because, even if the report is very good, we shy away from the taboos. I also note that the Commission had initially planned to come forward with an action plan in September and now the talk is about next year. I understand that some people are afraid of rapid developments – fintech was mentioned – but this is reality. This is what is happening and, as long as we sit on our hands, we will be overtaken by other parts of the world. If I look at the level of investment by the United States and China, this overtakes the European Union by far. The European Union is fragmented into 28 national markets. We are weak and not attractive for investors.  I get very worried when I read in the newspaper that a major European bank is actually investing EUR 20 million euros in fintech in China. It should be the other way around. We should be attractive enough for Chinese investors to come here and develop our own services. Europe has the potential to become the hub for retail financial services but, if we do not act more speedily, with more urgency and with more ambition, then we are going to lose the race because, colleagues – or those of you who are still around – this is not necessary for multinationals; they will find their way anyway. This is, however, urgently needed for consumers and SMEs, because they do need the European Union in order to eliminate the barriers. ALDE and the Green Group have tabled amendments and I very much hope for the support of the EPP Group and the S&amp;D Group, because we do not think it is enough to make noble statements here about the objective of eliminating barriers, maybe sometime next century. We need concrete deadlines and we need concrete objectives. That is why we hope that these amendments mentioning the deadlines will be adopted. Finally, it is a pity that, as usual, the Council is absent – the Council representing the Member States – because we all know that the biggest obstacle of all is national governments protecting their national champions. So where are they? Even the biggest Eurosceptics are always saying how important the internal market is. The government leaders are always saying how important the internal market is but, when it really comes down to it, they are actually blocking the opening—up of the internal market, doing a big disservice to their own citizens. So I hope that the Commission will come up with a really ambitious action plan as soon as possible.

The offer of existing financial products must be simplified and basic banking services offered as a right - for example, through a public bank.

In some product markets, benefits from competition are fairly straightforward to attain, but in retail financial services there are clearly complexities to be overcome in order to boost international competition. Many products rely on putative income streams or pay—outs far into the future, while charging regimes can be opaque, and let us not forget we are dealing with high value items designed to make a big difference to a person’s standard of life. This is not a pair of socks or a new pencil sharpener. The potential complexity of pursuing cross—border redress is one factor that has led thus far to pragmatic consumers tending to stick with suppliers from their own country of origin or residence. But, given the potentially large gains to consumers of being able to access the best advice and widest choice of products from across the world, Europe’s countries would do well to keep working at bringing down barriers in this field. As a world leader in retail financial services, the United Kingdom has much to offer the savers, investors and future pensioners of Europe. Any bid by the EU to use Brexit as a pretext for closing down consumer choice would leave Europe’s citizens facing a less prosperous and less secure future.

I agree fully with those of you who spoke about the 28 different legal regimes on our single market that fragment this market and do not allow it to use the whole potential that lies there. My committee, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO), also contributed to this work; we provided an opinion. We all see that the retail financial market is, despite the number of legislative measures at the EU level, still not used. We will continue our work on it. Also in the report on the regulation on geoblocking, which you mentioned already, consumers encounter numerous barriers. Having a bank account or a credit card is a prerequisite to almost every economic activity. But if consumers have problems with those services, they cannot as a result access any other services or goods normally accessible on this market, not to mention consumers’ problems and consequent frustration with other services such as loans, mortgages, investment products, insurance, etc. According to the most recent Consumer Markets Scoreboard, those markets are quite poorly rated by consumers domestically, and the cross-border perspective is even worse by a long way. The single market and the digital single market cannot work effectively without cross-border retail financial services. This is one of the most important issues. Therefore, I would like to repeat the conclusions from our committee and ask the Commission to undertake a detailed examination analysis of both national and cross-border obstacles, remaining barriers to cross-border operations and to the completion of the single market financial sector. The European Commission needs to identify the reasons behind the existing market segmentation and price discrimination and the European Commission should recommend measures to encourage financial institutions to compete beyond national borders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 74, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Anneliese DODDS", "mepid": "124969", "text": "   – Mr President, the ability for everyone to access high-quality, safe and affordable financial services has become increasingly important. Olle Ludvigsson’s report offers many suggestions on how we can encourage new growth areas, including cross-border services. But, of course, we also need to consider how we can better protect consumers.  People can be financially excluded in many different ways; they may lack safe ways to borrow, encouraging them to turn to payday lenders or loan sharks, or they may be unable to access funds and services across countries – with one of my constituents finding it next to impossible to access funds stolen from her family by the National Socialists mainly because of administrative impediments.  So I am really pleased the rapporteur has taken on board many of my concerns, from calling for a simple, safe and portable financial products framework to acknowledging issues arising from the digital divide, to making sure incentive structures for staff in financial services do not promote mis-selling or inappropriate cross-selling, to advocating rigorous and consistent enforcement of consumer protection across states. British consumers have been subject to many of the same sharp practices and scandals as other Europeans.

In this way, he can choose what to do and with whom to do the actions he needs for the investment and for the enhancement of his savings. The second theme is that of appeals: the possibility of appealing gives security to those who invest.

Most of us probably agree that the banks carry out important and versatile work that serves us all as private individuals, as small entrepreneurs, possibly also those who are large entrepreneurs. However, it raises some thoughts when you look at the information we see about the banks' return requirements. A bank that has a required return on its capital of 15 percent may be violating the rules that we in our great wisdom are writing here.

The report rightly points out that a single approach to retail services across the EU would be counter-productive at the moment, given the diversity of actors and the different products on the market, which are often tailored to local markets. However, there are definitely improvements that can be made to the status quo, which the report highlights. For example, I am pleased that our amendments calling for the sector to work better for consumers, start—ups, investors and SMEs through delivering a healthy and competitive environment were adopted. I also support the emphasis placed on the simplification of legislation, the opportunities for digitalisation and fintech, the benefits of switching, and the financial education of consumers. We do, though, have concerns. For example, the creation of a common tax identification number is not something I support, as it goes beyond the competences of the EU. For this reason my Group will vote against this provision. I am also baffled as to why there are calls in this report for more Member States to adopt the euro. That has nothing to do with this report. I will also not be supporting amendments from colleagues calling on the European supervisory authorities to increase their activities on consumers’ and retail investors’ issues. We need to be careful about duplication of existing structures in Member States and ensure that taxpayers’ money is well spent.  The call to intensify work against geoblocking in the financial sector should not be legislative at this stage. My Group agrees with the Commission approach of a financial services carve-out, due to its complexity. On the whole, this is a good report with some positive recommendations for the retail financial services sector and we thank Mr Ludvigsson for his good work.

As we know, this review is focused on three groups of measures: the review of the standardised approach for credit and operational risk, in order to enhance the risk sensitivity and robustness; the introduction of constraints to the use of internal models; the potential introduction of capital ouput floor based on the standardised approaches that defines the minimum amount of capital requirement for internally model exposures. The Parliament will be called, as co-legislator, to introduce the outcomes of this review into EU law. Taking into account the relevance and potential impact of the measures under discussion, we consider it necessary to intervene in the debate. We had an exchange of views with the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), the Commission, the European Banking Authority (EBA) and the Secretary-General of the Basel Committee, and we drafted this oral question and the resolution, which has been approved by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) with a very broad majority and will now be put to the vote before the plenary. As the resolution clearly states, we believe in the importance of sound global standards, and we reaffirm that banks need to be well capitalised in order to support the real economy and reduce risk. We also consider it important to increase simplicity, comparability and convergence of the risk-weighted capital framework in order to address excessive variability in risk-weighted assets and to apply the same rules to the same risks. However, we think that the current revision, in order to be effective and not to have unintended and counterproductive consequences, needs to fully respect two principles. Firstly, it should not significantly increase overall capital requirements for European banks as the Basel Oversight Board has clearly stated. Secondly, the revision should not have a negative impact on the level playing field at global level. It should not exacerbate – rather it should mitigate – the differences between types of banks and between geographical areas, and it should not unduly penalise the EU banking model. As we know, although the draft standard has been built up by specific proposal subject to public consultations and specific quantitative impact studies, during the summary many concerns have been expressed and it clearly emerged that the various drafts did not respect the two above-mentioned principles. For this reason, we are calling on the Basel Committee to revise its proposals. We also call on the ECB, the SSM and the Commission to ensure the respect of the two principles in the finalisation and monitoring of the new standard. As the resolution clearly states, we consider that this would be instrumental for ensuring a consistent incorporation of the new measures into EU legislation. We understand that some steps in the right direction have been taken, and we encourage all the remaining critical elements to be addressed. As regards the use of internal models, they need to address the variability of risk-weighted assets should not be a reason to drop the sensitiveness of prudential requirement. It should be rather an incentive to deal with lack of organisation in modelling approaches, as the EBA and the SSM have already been doing since 2014, in order to ensure that risk-weighted assets are always consistent with the actual risk behaviour of banking assets.  Last, but not least, the resolution expresses concerns about the potential effect on the real economy of the possible introduction of output floors. The output floor is closely linked to the leverage ratio, and the new standard should ensure that the level of calibration of these two measures does not lead to an unintended duplication that could not only end up with an undoubtedly punitive outcome for the euro in terms of capital requirements, but also undermine the effectiveness of the overall reform package. In conclusion, with this resolution the Parliament reaffirms its commitment to work on agreed international standards, but at the same time it warns that those standards should fully take into account the specificity of the EU banking model and strike the right balance between stability and growth. We hope that the adoption of this resolution with a broad majority will contribute to this balanced outcome.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 89, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, as you know, the Basel Committee is currently reviewing the rules on capital requirements for banks. The declared aim is to find a better balance between risk sensitivity, simplicity and comparability of the outcomes of those rules. A key focus of the Basel Committee is the use of internal models. Specifically, the Basel Committee considers that, under the current rules, capital requirements calculated using source models can vary in a way that does not always reflect the differences in banks’ risk profiles, and feels that such unjustified variations should be tackled. The Commission supports the Basel Committee’s broad objectives, but we are also clear that we need an intelligent solution which maintains a risk—sensitive approach to setting capital requirements and which does not significantly increase capital requirements. We believe that the work undertaken by the Basel Committee would lead to less variability in risk-weighted assets, but not all variability is bad. In fact most of the variability is perfectly justified as it reflects actual differences in risk. It is important to ensure that the capital framework continues to reflect these differences. It is perfectly normal for a bank focused on lending in a sector and region with low risks to have lower average risk rates than a bank operating elsewhere.  A problem we see with the proposals made by the Basel Committee is that they could potentially come at the expensive of reducing some of the justified variability, which would result in less risk-sensitive rules. The revisions contemplated by the Basel Committee should recognise that in a number of areas banks and borrowers in Europe have their particularities.  As William Coen told the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) recently, the Basel Committee has already made important changes to the revisions of the rules proposed initially and on some, but not all, EU specificities had to be taken into account through those changes. For example, the capital requirements for mortgages have been adjusted to take into account the very stable mortgage markets we have in the EU.  However, the Commission considers that, at this stage, the changes do not fully ensure a level playing field between the different regions in the world. In terms of the impact of capital requirements and on financial stability, the Basel Committee’s proposals could address some weaknesses in the current rules and could therefore increase the soundness of the banking sector and, consequently, financial stability. At the same time, taken together, the proposals could lead to a potentially significant increase in the capital requirements of EU banks, which would have an adverse effect or impact on lending to the economy, at least in the short term. So we need to find a solution which would not unduly weigh on the financing of the broader economy in Europe. At a time when we are focused on supporting investment, we want worldwide changes which would lead to a significant increase in overall capital requirements shouldered by Europe’s banking sector.  This is not just the Commission’s position. All Member States backed it in July and I understand that the resolution to be voted on in plenary on Wednesday goes very much in the same direction. Indeed this approach has been agreed by the Basel Committee itself so that the completion of Basel III should not lead to overall significant increases in capital requirements.  The Commission remains committed to the work done in the Basel Committee and we believe that it is in everyone’s interests to find a balanced solution. The Commission will keep on working intensively to ensure a solution that works for Europe and that does not put our banks at a disadvantage compared to our global competitors.

This week we will also receive proposals from the Commission to revise the capital adequacy rules, and we will continue on this path. But we also have to be careful that we operate the whole thing with a sense of proportion. Proportionality is a theme that we have included in all of our legislation. When implementing Basel II, we have forced all banks in the European Union to apply a risk standard if they do not have an internal rating model. I have no understanding that this model is suddenly to be made available again in Basel and that small and medium-sized banks in particular have to meet special capital requirements that neither comply with the principle of proportionality nor with risk weighting. That is why I very much welcome, Mr Vice-President, that the Commission made it clear from the start that the SME correction factor or SME support factor should be maintained, even if that was criticized in Basel. That was also very important to us as the EPP: We have to pay attention to how we implement Basel. Basel does not apply to the European Union, but is a global appointment. If I look at other economic areas - Roberto Gualtieri pointed out in his speech: Not all economic regions of the world are implementing Basel as we have done so far. We should also consider here whether a one-to-one implementation for all banks or perhaps only a partial implementation would be correct. One last comment I would like to make: we Europeans should learn to work together in Basel too. We have a number of central banks and a number of supervisory authorities on the Basel Committee. If Europe worked better together in the interests of our banking sector, we could take the lead in the Basel Committee and not the Americans, and I think we Europeans have what it takes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 91, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Pervenche BERÈS", "mepid": "1985", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D group. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President, we are discussing here what the Basel Committee is going to adopt by the end of the month and I think it is very important that, as Vice-President, you attend this discussion and you can be the advocate of this Parliament, since deep down, we know very well that we are the main users - the main beneficiaries, if I may say so - of the work of the Basel committee. We are the ones who apply these standards drawn up in Basel with the most seriousness and consistency. The voice of Europeans must be heard and what we represent as a banking model must be represented. From this point of view, the questioning of the internal model raises questions, because we know very well that many banks in Europe use this model effectively and that it makes it possible to refine the financing conditions of the economy. From the point of view of the financing of the real economy - a subject which must nevertheless concern us as a priority when we are interested in the health of the banking sector - the hearing of Mr. William Coen in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs is not did not completely reassure us.

Finally, I note that in the resolution that we are going to vote by a large majority - I hope - we again raise the issue of the distribution of dividends by banks which, moreover, appear to be under-capitalized, a question which must be of concern, Mr. Vice-President, when we are looking for ways to regain the confidence of citizens in their banking sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 92, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Sylvie GOULARD", "mepid": "97137", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President, I am delighted to have you here this evening, because I believe that, even if the crowds are not present around you, it is still very important that you take the time, as has been said previously, to come and discuss with the representatives of the Europeans. In the spring, we adopted by a large majority an own-initiative report which insisted on the need for both transparency and accountability of bodies like the Basel Committee. Therefore, we very much appreciate that you are here. I also very much appreciate, personally and on behalf of the group, that you have taken very clear and very firm positions on a subject on which we have not always received such clear messages from the Commission. A first step was the arrival of Mr Coen in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. I believe that we can also congratulate ourselves that he came, even if, of course, a single debate cannot be enough to establish relations of trust. This will have to be followed over time by a dialogue. Today I would like to send two messages. The first is pretty obvious, but I think it bears repeating over and over again: we are in favor of international cooperation. It is obvious that Europe wants to be open and work with others, but there is no question that this will ultimately translate into a greater impact in Europe than in other areas of the world on the financing of economy. Mario Draghi told us earlier, in your presence, that we are barely starting to regain pre-crisis growth levels after eight years. So there is really no need to undermine growth in any way, and it will have to be done. On this point, in fact, we are counting a lot on the Commission to work to reconcile the positions of the States. I hope there can be a follow-up to the own-initiative report I mentioned, so that both in the Council and the Commission, between the ECB and the European Banking Authority, we can better defend European interests together, without necessarily create very cumbersome procedures, always taking care not to jeopardize the financing of the economy. One last remark about the American elections. I remember that for this report I went to Congress last year. I had been very struck by the opposition between the Democrats, on one side, and the Republicans, on the other, around the Dodd-Frank Act and the Volcker rule. It's a little early to find out, but maybe the election of Donald Trump will have an impact on how Americans view regulation. I would like, Mr. Vice-President, that we try as much as possible not to find ourselves in Europe to make progress at the Basel Committee with Americans from the previous administration and then be confronted with the day when we will have to work, with partners, including other regions of the world, who would no longer agree to move forward.

However, the rules for their accounting have become increasingly complex and opaque, as is always the case with interest groups that always profit from the lack of transparency. Today, the citizen learns that the risk assessment models of the assets are the responsibility of the so-called systemic banks, unlike the others that are subject to a standardized model, that is, we have, as was demonstrated by a study by Standard & amp; Poor's, assets with different weightings from bank to bank, that is, we have a system in which the solvency ratios and stress tests are completely manipulated by the big banks, thus removing any credibility from the supervision system.

I believe that it is necessary to understand that today's crisis is, instead, the very daughter of a deregulation of the financial markets that began in the 1980s. The EU looks at the straw, in this case, and does not look at the beam. The problem of our banks is not \"Basel yes or Basel no\", but a system crisis that has been \"euro-induced\" and the introduction of new rules that have been asymmetrical and distorting and have damaged our banking system. I think three small steps are enough to heal our system.

We are discussing the reform of Basel III a week before the crucial meeting of the Basel Banking Committee in Chile. At the same time, the new US administration wants to abolish the Dodd-Frank Act. During the election campaign, President-elect Trump declared that higher capital requirements and tighter supervision would restrict bank lending. And after his election victory, he has now announced that \"the Dodd-Frank Act will be dismantled and replaced with new regulations that promote economic growth and job creation\". Economic growth, job creation and investment - that is what we need in Europe now. And to do this, we need European banks that provide companies, private individuals and the public sector with sufficient liquidity, that is, provide the appropriate financing. With the draft of the equity and liquidity standards now available in the Basel Banking Committee, we will achieve exactly the opposite: European banks will lose competitiveness and profitability as a result of the new Basel III rules, as they will reduce their internal risk assessment by 25 to 30% - as far as the smaller ones are concerned - and some even need 50% more equity to back up their loans. This massive increase in the capital adequacy of banks, which is being sought by the US in particular, could lead to credit bottlenecks. Small and medium-sized enterprises, which have few other forms of financing, are particularly affected. For this reason, it is particularly important that the use of internal models for risk assessment, with which banks are allowed to calculate their own risks and thus their capital requirements, is maintained, no matter how much the US negotiators push for an output floor to be introduced.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 96, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Bendt BENDTSEN", "mepid": "96705", "text": "- Sir. Chairman! First of all, thank you to Commissioner Dombrovskis for representing European interests in relation to the Basel Committee. The Basel Committee is not a democratic institution and many EU countries are not represented. The Basel Committee is past, not present at all and totally undemocratic! We will have to raise this debate as well. I think that is worrying, and it means that the committee's findings do not always hit the spot on a broad comb and may risk hitting some countries much harder than others completely unjustifiably. Of course, it is important that we have a level playing field globally and that we ensure that the banks are properly prepared for future crises, but we must therefore be careful in Europe that we do not just dance to the American pipe when the Basel Committee's work implemented in the EU. We have to take into account the different European banking markets, and we cannot work with a model based on \"one size fits all\". If we are to uncritically accept a different risk assessment method than the one we have today, then we are doing ourselves a disservice! In the end, we run the risk of making much less of a distinction between secured and less secure loans. It will make it more expensive to borrow, whether the loan is for a secure or less secure purpose. We must remember that we in Europe are particularly based on the fact that our SMEs are financed through the banks, and we must not make it so expensive to borrow money that we are slowing down growth in Europe. So at the moment we have a Juncker plan, where we go out and finance a lot of small and medium-sized enterprises, and then there are people in the Basel Committee who want to do the opposite, namely pull growth out of our SMEs, reduce the opportunities for that SMEs can borrow money in the future because the financial institutions are going to pad themselves.

What we now see at the Basel Committee, however, is that standards are being set at an international level, whereby everyone is treated in the same way while the situation is not the same. Because, as has already been said by other speakers, our banking system is really different from, for example, the American one. If you look at the situation surrounding mortgages, for example, we in the Netherlands actually suffered hardly any loss on mortgages, even at the depths of the crisis in the housing market. It is therefore not logical that you treat them in the same way as the mortgages in America, which have caused many problems there.

You cannot look upon the financial sector as isolated from the economy as such. What we can see today is that an important part of the financial instability in the European Union is the lack of loans and investments, because that creates a vicious circle – decreasing investment, decreasing innovations, decreasing and undermined competitiveness, lower profits and increasingly non-performing loans and instability. Those things are linked together, and that is why we need to look upon the requirements for stability from the whole economy as such, and not only from one part of the economy. The financial economy is not decoupled from the rest of the economy, and in Europe banks are dominating regarding financing of SMEs but also financing on households and housing. They do a lot of different business, and that is why it is wrong to have the same sort of leverage rate for all sorts of banks. In the US, you have the banks that are one part of the financial sector, one part of the capital markets and may be focusing more on high—level business risks, while in Europe you have the whole perspective. That is why it is important to go further on regarding stability – to have the risk based approach but also to ensure that banks can lend money in order to secure that we can have growth in the economy. That is why, when we discuss Total Loss-absorbing Capacity (TLAC) we need to include it in the banking recovery resolution directive and the discussion about the MREL, and not to invent higher capital requirements but to secure that we have more stable banks and more stable growth in the economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 100, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Jonás FERNÁNDEZ", "mepid": "125046", "text": "- Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Roberto Gualtieri, for his work on this report to define how to apply Basel, in a few days, in a few weeks before a very important meeting.

A discussion on the Basel rules would in fact presuppose a slightly greater participation here in Parliament and a greater enthusiasm for the task. If we look at the history of the Basel agreements, we can say that they have reflected the illusions that politicians at various stages have had about banking operations. During the crisis of 2007–2008, we had a bitter experience, ie. a large part of that crisis actually arose on the basis of the incorrect rules written by the Basel Committee. For that reason, it is of the utmost importance that we succeed in rewriting these rules and actually implementing them in a way that makes them work.

The first one is the comparability of internal models, and this is a precondition for proper supervision. Models must be comparable across the institutions supervised. So we must keep up the good work which is already done in this area – and it is not only about the work of the European Banking Authority (EBA) but also about the functioning of the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM), which takes us towards a common understanding of the assessment and the approval of models. I believe that the use of internal models, in which there has been huge investment in recent years, enables information to be processed better and with a higher level of granularity than a standardised approach would permit. Given that these have been introduced only relatively recently, it is no surprise that we still need to figure out how to fine tune some concepts and rules. And, in this context, transparency on the process of granting authorisation to use internal models seems a key point. The second issue is that of proportionality. I would be in favour of a wide definition of the term as a fair balance between the costs and benefits of a measure for each group of stakeholders, so that the new rules do not result in a disproportionate burden on some types of banks or some regions of the world. The last issue is that of global standards. My belief is that, if we want to avoid global fragmentation, we should adhere to these closely, in particular when we regulate an activity such as finance, which is transnational and cross-border in nature. I can understand that some would want to depart from the global standards on certain points, when they are not suited to specific situations.

Of course, financial stability and a robust banking sector with sufficient equity capital are paramount, but there are fears that the proposed rules will have serious consequences for this real economy. The agricultural sector in Europe and the Netherlands is currently in a difficult period, partly due to low milk prices and the Russian boycott. The agricultural sector, especially young farmers with a lot of equity capital in the form of land, often has to take out a new mortgage, among other things in order to comply with animal welfare, the nitrates directive and the climate agreement. Therefore they need a continuation of their mortgage. The future of many farmers depends on the provision of transitional credits. The same also applies to our construction sector, which is emerging from a deep trough. Citizens must be able to continue to obtain a mortgage to buy a house. That is why the European Commission must not remain on the sidelines. There is a possibility to use key instruments, such as the Juncker Plan, and this proposal is also made in the report by Cees Veerman of the Task Force on the future of the agricultural sector.

Such approaches give consumers transparency, supervision and affordability. It is essential that we keep that in Europe, so we need to regulate to make loans from risky banks more robust, but we also need to ensure that the system works well for the people, and that our economy is being protected so we can protect our competitiveness.

The surge of instability and unpredictability around the Union borders is a reality and a cause of concern to all European citizens. In order to defend itself and increase its security, the European Union must do more and must be consistent. Our Union is not equipped to face overwhelming defence challenges. For almost 30 years, the majority of the Member States applied cuts in their defence budgets, leading to smaller armed forces. Cooperation among Member States is occasional, and Europe continues to rely heavily on NATO capabilities and on US solidarity. Many Member States have called, over the past year, for effective and increased cooperation on defence. Let us be clear: the momentum to move towards a working European defence policy is here. Tomorrow, Parliament is voting on the European Defence Union report. As rapporteur, my main recommendations included the goal for EU countries to spend 2% of their GDP on defence, helping to finance infrastructure in Member States at the Union’s eastern border, and establishing a military Schengen area. The role of NATO has been, is and will continue to be paramount. There is also no reason to say that EU defence cooperation is weakening NATO. This is simply not true. On the contrary, for years NATO has wished to see the EU as a partner complementing it. There are several issues on which the EU could improve its security cooperation internally as well as with NATO. At the moment, movement of the allies’ defence forces personnel is troublesome, bureaucratic and time consuming. The EU must create a system to change this reality: in other words, the so-called military Schengen should be established. We can talk endlessly about increasing the efficiency of defence costs – and that is necessary – but in order to reach a certain level of quality we need also quantity. The EU Member States must set themselves the goal of spending 2% of their GDP on defence, as the NATO countries have done. This would give a clear signal of the joint positions of the EU and NATO. In order to carry out the EU defence policy we must contribute additionally from our common EU budget. The right way to do this will be through the EU’s Multiannual Financial Framework. The EU can financially support, for example, the placement of international NATO battalions in the EU Member States by backing the building of necessary infrastructure such as roads, barracks and other facilities. At the moment, most of this burden falls on a few specific Member States who, due to their geopolitical location, need an increased NATO presence. At the same time, the increased presence serves as a protection for all the EU and NATO countries. The EU must also gear up the defence research programme and start developing a common European policy on capabilities and armament. We need to strengthen the industrial and technological base of our defence sector in order to decrease dependency on third parties. The practical steps also require a political framework in order to ensure sufficient political attention. Therefore, it would be reasonable to create the position of European Commissioner for Defence and to set up regular meetings of the EU defence ministers. Furthermore, it is necessary to establish the headquarters for the EU military operations. The Member States that are ready to undertake more binding commitments could set up permanent structured cooperation arrangements so that it would be possible to establish multinational forces. An option would be to further develop the EU battle group system. And, lastly, Europe can and must enable a real defence dimension without further delay. The Union must become proactive, especially in the security field.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 118, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "- Madam President!

This is part of the wider package, together with the Commission’s European Defence Action Plan and concrete proposals for the implementation of a joint declaration on EU/NATO cooperation, signed in Warsaw. The adoption of the related Council conclusions last Monday is a major step forward for the EU, as it opens a new chapter for all the security and defence efforts in the union. A stronger Europe is what we need now more than ever, in view of the unprecedented security challenges we are facing. This is what our citizens and our partners expect from us. I would like to welcome Mr Urmas Paet’s report on the European Defence Union. Our views coincide in most of the areas, and the report addresses many critical issues that we have been working on in the security and defence implementation plan for the EU global strategy. The objective is to define our security and defence strategic priorities and to see how common security and defence policy, being part of wider EU efforts, can contribute to tackling today’s and tomorrow’s multifaceted security challenges, as European citizens demand. From this point of view, I am also grateful to Mr Paet for drawing political attention to priority policy areas and issues that need the Member States’ and the European Parliament’s support. I would like to mention in particular capacity building on security and development, permanent structured cooperation, deployability of the battle groups and the strengthening of the defence industry. Mr Paet’s report is a useful asset to our future work and to thinking ahead on how and in what direction should we move in policy issues and also in terms of structures if and when Member States decide that the time has come for a European Defence Union. The three strategic priorities drawn from global strategy are clear: responding to crisis, building capacities of partners, and protecting the Union and its citizens. It is around these three strategic priorities that the Council has defined a new, comprehensive level of ambition for the EU and identified a number of actions to be undertaken in order to implement this level of a mission. Let me mention some of them: setting military and civilian capacity deployment development priorities; deepening defence cooperation, including setting up a coordinated annual review on defence; exploring the possibility of permanent structured cooperation; adjusting European External Action Service structures to improve our planning and conduct capability for Common Security Defence Policy missions and operations; strengthening the EU rapid response toolbox; looking into financing in the area of security and defence, including revision of internal mechanism. I would like to underline a few key principles on which there was broader agreement. First, the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP) remains an important instrument for external action. Second, cooperation with our partners is essential, but the EU needs to be able to act autonomously when necessary. And third, collective defence is NATO’s task so ensure full complementarity here. Particularly appreciated is the report’s reference to improving our structures for planning, conduct and situational awareness. In the short-term we will address the gaps we have in the operational planning and conduct for non-executive military options. We will present a proposal as soon as possible on this. It is important to know that we are not creating big new structures, but addressing shortcomings or streamlining the present components. We welcome the report’s strong statements about the need for a fair functioning and transparent internal market and for the Commission’s involvement in supporting defence research. We share the report’s statement that the current fragmentation of the market represents a weakness for the competitiveness of the European defence industry. So the European Defence Action Plan will set out proposals to strengthen the internal market, support the competitiveness of Europe’s industry and foster cooperation. The Council last week encouraged the Commission to support the Member States in implementing the identified capacity priorities, notably through the Action Plan. In particular, the Action Plan will propose ways to ensure an effective implementation of the two defence directives: procurement and transfers. We also welcome the strong support the Parliament has given to launching and providing a significant budget for preparatory action for defence research to be launched next year with a view to a substantial future defence research program under the next multiannual financial framework.  We think the main message is that today’s complex security challenges can only be tackled together. Therefore, we need a shared vision, a strategic framework and common actions.

That is why I welcome Mr Urmas Paet’s report on the European Defence Union (EDU), whose establishment is indeed a matter of urgency. I strongly agree with the report that the Lisbon Treaty provides already a solid basis for the EDU. One of the remarkable examples of that is Article 42(6) on permanent structured cooperation which has never been used. Therefore, I am very glad that the report calls finally for the creation of a permanent council of defence ministers. In addition, it is important that the report brings to life Article 41(3) on creating the military start-up fund.

This can become a first crucial step in overcoming the obstacles among Member States regarding the collective procurement of defence resources which should be at level of 35%, according to the European Defence Agency benchmark.

Keith Taylor is unfortunately not here this week because he is in the hospital and asked me to present the report here for him. It is about the transport of people on inland waterways and also by sea. This report covers both ferry services and cruises, both maritime and inland waterway transport. We have succeeded in putting these issues higher on the EU transport policy agenda, and for this Mr Keith Taylor would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their good support. Of course, sustainability also plays a major role here. There are of course non-fossil renewable energy sources. For example there is a ferry, a zero-emission ferry on the Baltic Sea and many other things. After Paris and Marrakech, we have to include the ships in this objective. This applies particularly to sulfur emissions, and we are happy that the IMO has now decided that sulfur should be reduced to 0.5% worldwide. In the EU we are at 0.1% in the northern areas and that is all going in the right direction. Transport by water should of course also minimize external costs and internalize external costs, but this does not only apply to waterways, but to all modes of transport, because we have unfair competition between the different modes of transport: on the one hand, at the expense of environmentally friendly ones Types of transport, and that is the waterways and the railroad, and in favor of the climate-damaging modes of transport, that is the road and air traffic. The report also pays a lot of attention to safety: through better qualifications and education and through training of staff. All of this should be strengthened and the criteria of the IMO, these are minimum criteria that the EU should at least note, but they can also be reinforced.The quality and accessibility of ferry and cruise services must be optimized; in particular, all people with disabilities must have the opportunity to board these ships.There must be no discrimination against the disabled there.It's all very important.In conclusion, Mr Taylor would once again like to thank the shadow rapporteurs very warmly for their good support and cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 142, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "- I want to support the importance of water transport, also with regard to the specific topic of the Danube-Odra-Elbe transport link.It is one of the segments that remains fallow so far.It is the wealth of both the Czech Republic and Poland and the countries that follow this water transport route.I think that we should also assess these projects from a European point of view and motivate these countries to make this transport connection.In this way, I commented on only one part of water transport and its importance in terms of economics, but it is not only important in terms of economic results.It is also important from the point of view of our safety, because it allows a greater modality of transport connections and, secondly, it allows, for example, to bring water to those parts where they already feel the lack of these water resources.This is a very broad issue, and I thank the rapporteur and his deputy for presenting this report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 143, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR", "mepid": "96812", "text": "- Madam President, a few weeks ago I participated in the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions, which took place in the Azores Islands, and there I had the opportunity to present the importance of connectivity and accessibility for the outermost regions, which are crucial for the competitiveness, the three main axes of expression and implementation of European policy towards the outermost regions.

"text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, on behalf of the Commission and, in particular, my colleague Commissioner Bulc, I would like to welcome this initiative.  This report is indeed timely. We are convinced it will give further momentum to our maritime year 2017. The issues the report raises are very much the ones we want to work on. We want to ensure safe, secure and sustainable maritime transport that serves the internal market, connects Europe globally and keeps the EU maritime cluster competitive. Waterborne passenger transport is part of this story with the role it plays in people’s daily lives, for their leisure and for the employment it provides to many Europeans. So we welcome the fact that the report looks into passenger transport and leisure activities.  However, in some cases there are differences that should be recognised, for example, when it comes to financial assistance to transport operators linked to public service obligations, which is not generally available to cruise services. Regarding environmental aspects, limits on the sulphur content of shipping emissions were included in EU legislation in 2012 with effect from 1 January 2015. The International Maritime Organisation recently confirmed the global sulphur cap, as of 2020, in line with EU legislation. In 2013 the Commission set up the European Sustainable Shipping Forum, bringing together stakeholders to facilitate the implementation of environmental legislation in the maritime sector. In this framework a Green Shipping Guarantee Programme was developed and launched by the Commission in cooperation with the European Investment Bank this year. This programme is aimed at providing guarantees to accelerate investments in clean maritime technologies and to help the industry to go beyond the current EU environmental legislation. A first framework agreement with national financial institutions was recently signed, to be followed by others later this year. The total financial envelope of EUR 750 million approved for the Green Shipping Guarantee Programme is provided by the Connecting Europe Facility and the European Fund for Strategic Investment. Clean and sustainable shipping will be further promoted with the effective implementation of the directive on the development of alternative fuels infrastructure, ensuring the necessary standardisation and setting up of the basic fuel supply infrastructure between 2025 with EU financial support. The European Maritime Safety Agency will assist with the drafting of technical guidance to port authorities and administrations for liquefied natural gas bunkering. The TEN-T guidelines and their main financing instrument, the Connecting Europe Facility, supports the promotion of green shipping. In this context, over EUR 185 million were allocated in 2014 and 2015 for studies, pilot actions and infrastructure projects to support new technologies and innovation in processes. With regard to transport provided by ferries, integration with other means of transport, including integrated ticketing, is indeed important and, through the ITS Directive, technical and functional specifications are being developed. This will include timetables, as well as information, for passengers with reduced mobility. The Commission notes Parliament’s interest in extending passenger rights to multimodal journeys, in line with the principles enshrined in the current passenger rights regulations, among others the Waterborne Passengers’ Rights Regulation. The Commission is currently looking into possible initiatives in this field. In May 2016 the Commission submitted its report on the operation of the Waterborne Passengers’ Rights Regulation. Stakeholders and national authorities expressed their satisfaction with the regulation, but also agreed that further coordinated action, such as information campaigns to inform citizens about their rights, and cooperation between authorities to ensure the uniform application of the regulation, is needed to improve the regulation’s effectiveness.  The Commission welcomes the interest of Parliament in the question of the international governance of inland waterway transport. This issue is relevant both for passenger and freight transport and, in the context of the Commission’s NAIADES II programme, important steps of streamlining and regulatory convergence have already been taken through the creation, in the framework of the CCNR, of the European Committee for drawing up standards in the field of inland navigation. The Commission would also support the call to have more statistical data on passenger numbers, but it must be underlined that Eurostat can only collect data on the basis of legislation. Harmonised rules for accident statistics exist and a detailed report is published every year. Unfortunately this is not the case for inland waterways. Finally, the Commission fully agrees that ports play an important role in the performance of waterborne passenger transport and has already, since 2013, proposed a comprehensive ports policy. This includes measures to improve the efficiency of ports. We therefore count on your vote in favour of the Ports Regulation, which the Council and Commission expect to go to the plenary without much delay. We also count on your support in promoting good use of the EU’s instruments for finance and investments, notably the Connecting Europe Facility and EFSI.  The Commission believes that ports cannot develop in isolation from their neighbourhoods and thus encourages initiatives that improve the relationship between ports and port cities. Let me also use this opportunity to thank Parliament for its support in relation to issues on securing our external sea borders and the decisions on European coastguard cooperation.

I would emphasize that making better use of the capacity available for waterborne passenger transport can not only help reduce road congestion and CO2 emissions, but also improve air quality and provide better transport services overall. A form of transport that can also benefit tourism can be developed because it allows tourism to flourish along the waterway. In this way, it can also contribute to the economic recovery of a lesser-known region, the creation of new jobs and the creation of small businesses.

This will give us the opportunity to present our position ahead of the high-level meeting of the global partnership for effective development cooperation, to be held next week in Nairobi. This meeting is of crucial importance for the theme of development effectiveness since it is the first meeting of this type after the adoption of the Agenda 2030. For us, it is essential that the European Union adopts a strong position in Nairobi by insisting with determination on the need to build on the acquis in terms of development effectiveness and to strengthen existing cases of cooperation. The four principles of development effectiveness, namely ownership of development strategies, results orientation, inclusive partnership, transparency and reciprocal accountability are, in fact, as recognized in the draft outcome document. of Nairobi, the driving forces for the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Now is the time to act to make our development cooperation as effective as possible to achieve these ambitious goals and make the best use of public and private resources for development. Even if it is particularly suited to certain contexts, official development assistance cannot do everything, especially in the current economic context. It should complement countries' efforts to mobilize domestic resources and help catalyze private investment and additional public resources. Nevertheless, we must still insist on respecting the commitment to allocate 0.7% of GDP to development - and we are still far from it - as well as on additional efforts in terms of the quality of aid. provided. On issues like untying aid or aligning with country priorities, progress must be accelerated. Since we are talking about the mobilization of resources for development, I must in particular stress the role of the private sector. I believe that it is an important partner in achieving the SDGs and, like other development actors elsewhere, it must commit to aligning itself with the principle of development effectiveness. Beyond the private sector, the Nairobi meeting should also be an opportunity to reaffirm the importance of inclusiveness and partnerships with all actors to achieve the SDGs. We need synergies between the various development actors to achieve this and realize the full potential of these partnerships. The comprehensive partnership for effective development cooperation has an important role to play in this regard. It is essential to strengthen it, including in terms of monitoring, so that it is well positioned in the overall architecture for the implementation of Agenda 2030. The European Union, which has been one of the pioneers development aid effectiveness, must continue to play a leadership role on these issues as well as on the participation of civil society, national parliaments and other stakeholders, South-South cooperation, equality gender and women's empowerment. Responsibility for development results is certainly shared and, with Agenda 2030, we have an additional demand that results from the overall philosophy of leaving no one behind. Finally, there is a whole reflection, which we have developed in this report, which seems to me to be absent from the Nairobi draft final document. I think we have to insist on this point. Development effectiveness cannot be guaranteed without peace, respect for human rights and the rule of law. We therefore advocate for increased support for improving transparency, good governance and the rule of law in developing countries.They are as essential to achieving the SDGs as the other more technical prescriptions of the global agenda for development effectiveness.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 156, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Bogdan Brunon WENTA", "mepid": "124903", "text": "- Madam President!

It provides an important input to the second High-Level Meeting of the Global Partnership for Effective Development Cooperation (GPEDC). The development effectiveness agenda and GPEDC marked a shift from aid to development effectiveness, moving the focus from official development assistance flows to broader development partnerships and actors.  Five years after the forum held in Busan, Korea, it is a good moment to assess the implementation of commitments taken and to discuss how effective development cooperation can best contribute to implementing the 2030 Agenda on sustainable development and the Addis Ababa Action Plan on financing for development.  The EU should continue to lead and move these agendas forward. The new European consensus for development, which will guide the EU and Member States’ development policy in the years ahead will help develop effectiveness at its heart. We need to consider not just what we do, but how we do it.  Important steps have been taken to advance a more strategic and coordinated EU approach, for example by advancing a joint programming of EU and Member States development assistance; maximising our collective impact and minimising overlaps; increasing transparency of aid and mutual accountability; measuring results on the basis of our new results framework; promoting ownership of the development priorities by partner countries, and addressing conflict and fragility.  Nevertheless, in order to implement the 2030 Agenda successfully, more needs to be done at both EU and global level. The Commission believes that the Global Partnership should strengthen the political momentum behind effective development cooperation and support implementation of these principles and commitments at country level. It should promote multi-stakeholder platforms at country level and the use of available data to enhance dialogue. If strategically developed and used, the Global Partnership can indeed provide added value to other international fora in the implementation, thus contributing to the follow-up process of the 2030 Agenda.  The report rightly recognises that the specific value added of the Global Partnership is in its inclusive and multi-stakeholder character, and stresses the need for all actors to be involved in moving the effectiveness agenda forward. In order to become a true partnership of all relevant actors, the involvement of parliaments, civil society organisations, local authorities and private sector is essential. Averting situations of fragility also entails closer cooperation, notably with humanitarian actors, to build the resilience of vulnerable populations.  The private sector and providers of south-south cooperation can make a huge contribution to achieving the sustainable development goals. We need to improve our ways of working in partnership, such as through the recently proposed External Investment Plan and dialogues with southern providers. We also need to see action and commitments from these actors. We would like the outcome document of the Nairobi High-Level Meeting to include their ideas on how they will implement the principles in practice. The Global Partnership brings a special perspective by focusing on relations between development actors, but also through monitoring the progress of the implementation of principles and commitments. The recently published 2016 progress report entitled ‘Making Development Cooperation More Effective’ is a valuable source of evidence-based information to stimulate policy dialogue at country, regional and international level.

As the Hungarian authorities have not arrested this criminal, it will be up to the European authorities, Europol, to catch the circulated criminal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 191, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "László TŐKÉS", "mepid": "39726", "text": "- Madam President, as the December anniversary of the 1989 Timisoara uprising approaches, former high-ranking leaders of the former and new Romanian secret services are trying to discredit the Romanian anti-communist and anti-securitization Romanian revolution, a Soviet and Hungarian break-up of Transylvania.setting it as a subversion and coup.I would like to draw the attention of the Union and Parliament to the fact that the greatest threat to Romania's democratic transformation is still being the former Securitate, the old-new secret service, which, as a continuation of Ceausescu's National Communist policy, is using the chauvinist anti-Hungarian tool.counter-revolutionary activity.Let's defend the Romanian revolution and the Romanian-Hungarian historical solidarity!", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 192, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Victor NEGRESCU", "mepid": "88882", "text": "- Madam President, the European Union's objectives are to stimulate research at European level. But, unfortunately, through the way it implements its programs, it generates new pay discriminations between researchers from Eastern and Western Europe. Despite the fact that the funds are won through competitions at European level, in the main Horizon 2020 research and innovation program there are huge differences between the salary scales applied. I ask, therefore, the European Commission: how is it possible that a type A expert in a European project can earn about 70 euros (300 lei), while the income of the Romanian researcher in the same project is ten times higher small, being reduced to only about seven euros? Thus, I stand in solidarity with the initiative of Babeș Bolyai University in Cluj-Napoca and the Polytechnic University of Bucharest and I firmly ask the European Commission to restore a unitary salary for all European researchers. At equal work, equal pay.

He said that Brexit might deal Ireland’s economy an even heavier blow then Britain’s, even though we had no say in the referendum. Already we have seen the impact of the changes on sterling. This has had an immediate effect on small businesses, particularly those that export. Their exports are less competitive, they are more expensive on the shelves and when dealing with UK relationships. Imports from Britain are cheaper, thus putting further pressure on small businesses in Ireland. Britain takes two-fifths, or 40%, of exports from Ireland. Beef and dairy are already feeling a strong impact, as is the mushroom sector, which exports 80% of its production to Britain. Undoubtedly, the impact of Brexit on Ireland – as has been said by others and not just in our country – is going to be severe, and it needs to be ensured that this is reflected in the negotiations as we move forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 194, "date": "2016-11-21.json", "name": "Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI", "mepid": "28314", "text": "This item is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
