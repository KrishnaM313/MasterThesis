I could not believe my ears when Ms Jaakonsaari then wanted confirmation. Unsurprisingly, the confirmation came that what we heard was indeed true.  The argument runs as follows: the Russian economy is doing well – I have my doubts whether the Russian economy is doing well – therefore Russia has the right to dissolve human rights groups. Because this was the illogical consequence of the argument – that when the economy is doing well in any country in the world, it has the right to suppress human rights. I was not expecting this argument to be put forward in this Chamber, but it has been, and as some Members have said, it is good to rebut these arguments – and not just ignore them, because the moment we ignore them, the moment people make their intervention and then do not remain here to listen to the rebuttal of that argument, then that argument becomes credible. So it is a good thing that we fight this argument because what has been done to Memorial is not only damaging to Memorial itself in Russia, but to the entire civil society in Russia.  I would like to say what our High Representative has done, what the Commission has done. We have publicly expressed at the latest OSCE Permanent Council meeting last Thursday and also at the Council of Europe yesterday our firm conviction, as a Commission, that this decision is in contradiction with the very same international obligations which Russia has adhered to. It is not just the European Parliament condemning something politically, but that Russia is not adhering to its international legal obligations as regards human rights. To this end I remind this House, as this House has also publicly declared, that it has paid tribute to the courage of this organisation and awarded the 2009 Sakharov Prize to Memorial representatives, and that this was just a few months after the head of the Chechnya office, Natalya Estemirova, had been brutally murdered.  The steps taken by the justice ministry in Russia take place in the context of a shrinking space for civil society, with the Russian authorities attempting to weaken or suppress independent civil society organisations instead of empowering them. For the last two years, as this House knows, the so-called law on foreign agents has led many organisations, such as ADC Memorial and Golos, to close down completely in order to avoid further criminal prosecution of their leaders, and some activists have also fled Russia.

Even recently we have heard from the International Labour Organization estimates that around about a million Uzbek adults and children have been pressed into forced labour within the cotton harvest, as well as flagrant abuses on the part of the regime.  Now this blind eye does go back a long way, and back in 2004 Craig Murray, who was the UK Ambassador to Uzbekistan at the time, uncovered evidence of a man who had been boiled to death by the regime for a refusal to give up his faith and pledge allegiance to the regime. This was verified by Glasgow University, but instead of applauding Mr Murray’s diligence the UK hounded him from office. This does go back a long way. So if the UK and the Member States will not take the lead, the EU is in a position to do so. We have cleaner hands than most, perhaps, and I would refer the Commissioner to point 11 within the resolution stating that the EU should take the lead and table a UN Human Rights Council resolution under Item 4 establishing a dedicated country-specific mechanism for Uzbekistan.

We insist that Uzbekistan should comply with international human rights commitments but we also offer Uzbekistan, as some of you have said, our cooperation to promote reforms, to move ahead and to break away from its past authoritarian legacy.  The Commission is now pursuing this reform agenda at a very delicate juncture. Why? Because elections are approaching, the regional perception of violent radicalism is acute and a general suspicion about external interference is setting in. All this hardly creates the kind of enabling environment that would be conducive to quick and bold reforms. Moreover, there are many pending human rights issues which are of concern.  So I would like to inform the House that it must rest assured that the very issues highlighted in its resolution, such as the torture of detainees, arbitrary detention, major restrictions on the freedom of association, assembly, expression and religion, child and forced labour, are precisely those that the European Union has been raising on every occasion, including in high-level contexts and in our annual human rights dialogue.  Parliament can rest assured that the Commission will do it again in our next human rights dialogue set for this November, with the aim of achieving concrete results and in this context. Replying to the Honourable Mr Smith, the Commission will look into this issue which you address in paragraph 11 of the resolution. Rest assured that we shall really look into this issue. Today, I would like to emphasise one of the core issues at stake which were mentioned by some honourable Members, namely child and forced labour. Thanks to our insistence and facilitation efforts, constructive cooperation has now developed between Uzbekistan and the International Labour Organization and tangible results have already been achieved on child labour, while cooperation has also started on forced labour under a decent work country programme agreed with the ILO.  So we very much hope that Uzbekistan will take the same positive approach in other areas. We stand ready to cooperate with the Government of Uzbekistan in any efforts that it undertakes to ensure compliance with its international commitments and in the implementation of recommendations that it has already voluntarily accepted during the universal periodic review process at the United Nations Human Rights Council.  So, in conclusion, Madam President, our policy of constructive engagement aims to build on what has been achieved on child labour with a view to bringing about similar advances in other areas of concern.

These appalling events, and the collusion between local authorities and criminal gangs which they have brought to light, have shocked Mexican society and the international community alike. We have seen a wave of public demonstrations over the incidents, which continue to this day. The events have also drawn unparalleled attention in the local and international media. From the very beginning, the EU delegation in Mexico and the European External Action Service (EEAS) have been in contact with the Mexican authorities, closely following developments. The EU delegation, in agreement with the heads of mission of the EU Member States present in Mexico, has expressed its profound concern over the crimes committed and called for an impartial and exhaustive investigation. Mexico is a close and valued strategic partner of the EU. The EU and Mexico have a strong convergence of views on human rights issues, both in multilateral human rights forums and also bilaterally. Mexico, belonging to the same group of like-minded partners as the EU, has been a strong supporter of many EU initiatives and resolutions in Geneva and in New York. Our regular High-Level Dialogue on Human Rights has allowed for several open and frank discussions on core human rights issues, including the fight against organised crime and reform of criminal justice. The international community should join forces with Mexico to support it in facing this difficult and complex challenge: the fight against organised crime and impunity. It is in this spirit that the EU supports the efforts of the federal government. Key issues in this endeavour are: strengthening the justice system, a reform of the police, reinforcing the culture of citizen security, and the observance of human rights. Human rights priorities for the EU in Mexico include the criminal justice system – and the issues of impunity, torture and arbitrary detention – as well as gender violence and threats against human rights defenders and vulnerable groups. These priorities guide the EU human rights dialogue and cooperation in Mexico. I would like to remind the House that through the Social Cohesion Laboratory II project, with an EU contribution of EUR 11 million, the EU supports capacity building at the level of federal institutions and in the states of Oaxaca and San Luis Potosi. Under the European Instrument for Human Rights and Non-State Actors thematic programme, the EU supports around 30 projects, including in the field of criminal justice reform, for an amount of EUR 7.5 million. In conclusion, we condemn the latest events with all our energy. The Mexican Government must carry out its investigations, bring the perpetrators of crime to justice and regain control of lawless areas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2014-10-23.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Worse, while we see everywhere that the enlargement of the Union to the Eastern countries has created unfair competition between workers and caused massive relocations to these countries, the European Parliament proposes to continue this suicidal policy by extending the application of Regulation (EU) 374/2014 on the reduction or elimination of tariffs on goods originating in Ukraine, a country whose average monthly wage is just US$292!

I am particularly pleased to support the measure given that it is the result of a social partner agreement between employers and workersʼ unions. By engaging in constructive social dialogue, inland waterways employers have recognised the fact that fair working conditions and adequate rest are essential to productive operations.

Although the Commission does not provide for Parliament to be consulted on the question under Article 155(2) TFEU, the Commission has forwarded its proposal to Parliament and, at the same time, asked it to give its opinion to the Commission and the Council. Convinced that democratic participation and parliamentary sovereignty are the foundations on which the European Union project rests, I would like to encourage the Commission to consult more frequently of this kind. In addition, the nation states and the preservation of their sovereignty have always been a central concern for me.
