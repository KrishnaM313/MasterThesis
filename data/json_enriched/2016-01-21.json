Unfortunately, I am not convinced that this is true. On the contrary, judging from recent events, the terrorist threat seems to be increasing in the European Union, but also in its vicinity and further afield, as the recent attacks in Istanbul, Jakarta, Ouagadougou and Charsadda in Pakistan have shown. As the Presidency, we will do everything within our powers to improve the Union’s capacity to counter this threat and to protect our citizens. In this context, counter—terrorism will be a key topic at the informal meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers next week in Amsterdam. The Presidency also attaches great importance to the rule of law and to getting the balance right in this respect in the fight against terrorism. Obstacles to the exchange of information on foreign terrorist fighters and the way forward to clear these obstacles will be first and foremost on the agenda. Another issue that we will address is information sharing between Member States on firearms and explosive precursors. Implementation of the measures agreed is key, as indicated in the EU Internal Security Strategy 2015-2020.  The Heads of State and Government statement on counter-terrorism of 12 February 2015, after the Charlie Hebdo attacks, remains the framework the European Union needs to implement urgently, as called for by the European Council. You can be assured that the Presidency will spare no effort to promote rapid progress in its implementation. Progress has been made over the past months and was set out in a public report by the European Union Counter—Terrorism Coordinator in late November.  Information sharing and operational cooperation are top priorities identified by the Council. Progress has been made. The agreement on the European Union PNR Directive will support police and intelligence agencies in tracking down possible terrorists and criminals by accessing travel details of passengers.  On 1 January, Europol launched the European Counter—Terrorism Centre (ECTC). This is a more robust platform through which Member States can increase information sharing and operational coordination. This includes the monitoring and investigation of foreign terrorist fighters, as well as the trafficking of illegal firearms and terrorist financing. In November 2015 Member States committed to seconding counter-terrorism (CT) experts to the ECTC to form an enhanced cross-border investigation support unit. Europol is actively engaged in supporting ongoing CT investigations in several Member States. The progress of contributions to the various EU databases is being monitored and discussed in the Council.  Outside the European Union context, cooperation and information sharing among security services will be stepped up in the context of the Counter Terrorist Group (CTG), and the Commission will soon present its proposal on updating the European Criminal Records Information System for the systematic sharing of criminal records data for people connected to terrorism.  Furthermore, we have started discussing the proposal to amend to framework decision on combating terrorism. On 2 December 2015, the Commission presented a draft directive with a view to collectively implementing UN Security Council Resolution 2178 and the additional Protocol to the Council of Europe Convention. Negotiations on this directive are already under way and we hope to be in a position to achieve an agreement in June this year. Apart from enhancing the exchange of law enforcement information, countering radicalisation and recruitment remains a priority. An EU approach is needed, taking into account that over 5 000 citizens have left to fight for terrorist organisations in Iraq and Syria. Concerning integration and non-discrimination, we should create opportunities for all. We should do much more on tolerance and anti-Muslim hatred, further inter-religious dialogue and communicate our values. Education is key and we look forward to Commission initiatives in this context.  But prevention alone is not enough. The return of well—trained radicalised individuals poses a genuine security threat. At European Union level, the main tool we have for sharing best practices is the Radicalisation Awareness Network. This network has made impressive strides in recent months, facilitating the flow of best practice and expertise between Member States. We can also begin to share expertise with third countries. The immediate focus here will be the Middle East, the North Africa region and Turkey.  It is a fact that the internet is one of the primary channels for radicalisation, publishing and proliferating illegal content. The establishment of an Internet Referral Unit within Europol’s Counter—Terrorism Centre has improved our ability to obtain the removal of terrorist threats. On 3 December 2015 the EU Internet Forum was launched. The objective is to identify and remove terrorist content and to develop effective counter-narratives. In this context, cooperation with the providers is obviously important.  The discussion of the Commission’s proposal for an EU action plan against illicit trafficking in and use of firearms and explosives has begun. The Presidency aims to reach a general approach on this new proposal. Finally, I would like to mention the border police package, which is also important in the context of the fight against terrorism, as we have to strengthen controls at the EU’s external borders. Border security is not a top priority under our Presidency. On this issue one should of course be careful about mixing migration and terrorism. We cannot turn our eyes away from the threat, but let us not forget that the vast majority of migrants are fleeing situations of conflict and even fleeing from terrorism themselves. The close cooperation with key partners, such as the United States, is continuing. Furthermore, we will continue to strengthen our counter-terrorism engagement with partners in North Africa, the Middle East, Turkey and the Western Balkans.  Let me conclude by saying that I think we all share the same objectives. Among other things, this was demonstrated by your resolution of February last year on anti-terrorism and the reports adopted by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs at the end of last year. We look forward to a fruitful cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, as you all know, 2015 has been a turning point in Europe’s experience of terrorism. Terror has claimed the lives of 150 innocent people – too many lives lost, and too many lives scarred. We have to be realistic: the terrorist threat in the European Union is high. The terrorist threat is there. We are determined to respond with resolve and resilience, and at the same time to uphold our values of tolerance, democracy and respect for fundamental rights. From day one of this Commission, we stressed that combating terrorism was a common European responsibility. Our European Agenda on Security has been on the table, as you know, since last April. We have drastically accelerated its delivery with the political agreement on the EU PNR, the proposal for a directive on terrorism, the November firearms package, the action plan on firearms trafficking, the EUROPOL Regulation adopted in December, the reinforced RAN Centre of Excellence to counter radicalisation, the launch of the EU internet forum to counter harmful content online and, just this week , the proposal to exchange the criminal records of non-EU nationals.  These are all tangible measures to strengthen our security across borders, and more is coming. 2016 will be the year when we go after terrorist money. We need to deprive terrorists of their financial resources. In early February, we will put our ideas forward with a concrete timetable. Our Borders Package of last December is also a critical piece of the puzzle, because it will allow the systematic security checks of all people leaving and entering the EU. It is clear that we need to improve the management of our external borders in order to enhance internal security and safeguard Schengen. I want to be clear, once again, on a related point: refugees, who are crossing our borders because they need international protection, and who are entitled to international protection, are not terrorists. I want to reaffirm that we will never equate refugees with terrorists. We cannot, and we must not, allow fear to prevail.  Let me finally turn to information sharing: this is a sensitive, but as you will understand, a very crucial issue. As you know, it is one of the central pillars of our Security Agenda. The EU tools are there to facilitate the exchange of information between national law enforcement authorities. The Schengen Information System, Europol’s databases and the Prüm framework should be used to the maximum by the Member States. Member States need to trust each other more: they need to share more information, between themselves and also with Europol. Law enforcement authorities across Member States, including specialised law enforcement agencies, all work for the same purpose: the security of our citizens. We need to understand that, collectively, we are all safer. The threats we face are common. Our approaches to the threats need to be common too. This is not a competition. We reinforce each other if we cooperate. Information is already being exchanged at various levels – but we need more of it, not less.  Next week, we will officially launch the European Counter Terrorism Centre at Europol. It has been operational since 1 January 2016. The Centre can become the hub of our counter-terrorism operations if we make the best use of it, and if Member States share information. This centre can only succeed in its mission if we all help it to succeed. The support provided by Europol to French and Belgian investigators after the Paris attacks is the best example of the role that the European Counter Terrorism Centre could play: cross-checking data, facilitating information-sharing and providing analytical and operational assistance to the national services on the ground. One year ago, following the Charlie Hebdo attacks, we stressed that our response would not be dictated by fear or driven by hasty conclusions. The Commission proposed several concrete actions which are part of a comprehensive approach, and in this collective effort we have made progress. But recent events remind us that we still need to do much more. Now is the time to act and to strengthen our cooperation.

Mr President, today Dabiq magazine entitled 'Just terror' writes: 'Let Paris be a lesson for those nations that wish to take heed.' But the policy of terrorism cannot pass into the European Union, because the European Union is inspired by the principles and rules of the policy of democracy. Today, according to Europol's research, some six or five thousand European citizens are terrorists. Are we going to allow this to continue? How can we control it? What have the European Union and the Council done? We've taken steps, very important. Our answer to the terrorists is that fear will not prevail. But how can this phenomenon be controlled? There are structured groups, there are networks of terrorists, there are targets: human lives, marginalisation of Europe, closure of borders. The policy we are pursuing is very correct and we cannot confuse immigration with terrorism, because it has nothing to do with one phenomenon with the other, regardless of whether the uncontrolled flow of migrants often also involved terrorists. But there is no way for the European Parliament, for the European Union, for the European concept of the world, to identify these two phenomena. Ladies and gentlemen, what we must be very careful about, and indeed very seriously, is how we manage to control the phenomenon. We will check it through the Internet, we will check it through the cooperation of the Member States, we will control it through cooperation with third countries, because terrorism has a face, an extremely repugnant person, to whom the European Union's response can only be more Democracy.

Their aim is to spread fear and thus destroy freedom and democracy. That is why it is clear that we have a clear edge against terrorism, that our free societies are being defended.  What does that mean? Firstly, current terrorism is not a national phenomenon. That is why the existing European tools for identifying and exchanging information need to be made much better. Better prevention: this includes debunking terrorist propaganda on the Internet, deleting illegal content and identifying its authors; Terrorists are turning the tap on the money and, above all, countering radicalisation in Europe, through integration and comprehensive counselling and exit programmes.  Protecting people, condemning perpetrators and instigators: our Member States are called upon to make the personnel and factual equipment of the police and the judiciary adequate. There must be no lawless spaces. Investigations must be carried out in an analogous and digitally effective manner, and judicial proceedings must be commenced in a timely manner.  Effective European law enforcement needs comparable definitions of crime and penalties for terrorist acts across the EU. The Commission has, of course, put forward a proposal on this. And also: fair procedures must always be guaranteed, also so that proceedings do not fail due to inadmissible evidence. Finally, prevent, protect and track.

It is time for this hypocrisy, this policy of wide-closed eyes, to be ended.

We must adapt our legislation to better prevent and track terrorism financing. It is not expensive to conduct attacks such as those in Paris. We need tighter rules on tools like prepaid cards and stricter anti-money-laundering rules. Regarding ISIS there are some ten sources of its financing. We must strangle them all, starting with oil trafficking.  Europe cannot be insecure. We must reinforce security measures at all levels, from local to EU-wide.

Information sharing, especially when it comes to information on suspects and risks, is still not working, and it is this that we need to strengthen: not gathering loads of data on individuals who are not relevant at all for investigators, but concentrating on the quick exchange of information on persons who are suspicious and areas where there are risks.

This is because, despite the attacks in Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Madrid and London, the wrong analysis is still being made of why the West is under attack from those who have supplied it to us. Despite the many deaths that have already been killed in the name of the Islamic State, you deny that these terrorists take their inspiration from the Koran. Despite the fact that it has been established that terrorists are using the asylum invasion to enter the European Union, some here still dismiss it as hysteria. And despite the acute threat of attacks across Western Europe, the political elite here still believe in the utopia called multiculturalism. Mr President, the only correct analysis must be that Islam is the greatest danger, Islam is out for world domination. But there is another great danger in Europe: the danger of the cowardly politically correct elite, who dare not call it by name, but who, through an open-border policy, are flooding the European continent with the Islamic invasion.  It is therefore incomprehensible to me that the many victims of terror, sexual assaults and rapes are still not a reason to put an end to this invasion. In fact, only in the first few weeks of this month, thirty-one thousand asylum seekers arrived in Greece, among them surely jihadists and hordes of testosterone bombs full of contempt for women. And they make grateful use of Schengen. Without borders, there is no security and the question is not if, but when we can expect the next attack or organised mass assault. So, if you really take this heightened terror threat and the security of the people of our European countries seriously, then it is time for you to recognise that the only solution in the fight against terror is to close down national borders, to send all those so-called asylum seekers back to where they come from, and to stop the Islamisation of the European continent.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 15, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Lampros FOUNTOULIS", "mepid": "125070", "text": "  NI).

The news is not comforting these days and, all the more so, we expect to be able to say, as the European Parliament, that the action we are taking in the European Union, both on pnr data management policies and in an attempt to share a reasonable but firm defence policy on our continent, is heading in the right direction.

I agree with those who, even during this debate, have rightly decided to deny a causal link between immigration and terrorism. It is wrong to associate the two phenomena in a general way, but it is equally wrong to deny that the two phenomena may have common causes. It is wrong to think that if Islamic areas normally produce terrorist phenomena such as those that have dramatically affected our continent, it is wrong to believe that that front, where we often find men who use the Koran as a breviary to administer violence, can be left in a position to continue to do so.

Young people born in Europe who succumb to radicalisation as a result of their exclusion from society. The challenges are exceptional.  Terrorism is a threat to peace and world order, but it is important that we separate and emphasise once again: we must not connect refugees with terrorism! Most refugees are fleeing terrorism and war. People's safety is essential, but only measures to strengthen security are doomed to fail unless we adequately accompany them with social policies at home, but also outside Europe, to prevent radicalisation. We must address the causes of the crises at its origins. Europe also urgently needs a clear strategy on how to deal with returnees. Information sharing, yes, that's the key. Until it works between countries, then, unfortunately, no action will help. That is why building trust is also key. Member States should cooperate more actively in the exchange of information on crime, tracing and financing of foreign fighters, terrorist cells, arms tracking and other threats to European security. I am surprised by the Council's stance, which has not agreed to the mandatory exchange of information on potential terrorists in the new PNR Directive, despite the fact that it could prevent many tragedies. We must stand up more forcefully against radical Islamist propaganda on social media, empower parents and enforce parental permits for young people's travel, give more voice to victims, more effectively identify and rehabilitate the society of troubled, radicalised individuals.

I would ask the President of the House that when Members of the House issue insults and incite against the Heads of Government of our countries and their wives, allegedly on behalf of the people, they should be told that this is not a parliamentary way of dealing with each other. Turning now to the factual question, terrorism is one of the greatest threats. And, ladies and gentlemen, I can join you in saying that for twenty years I was accompanied by bodyguards and our family was threatened by terrorists. That's why I know pretty well how people feel who are threatened. But this blow to terrorism has another dimension. It is directed against people, all those who do not follow the crude, confused and erroneous understanding of ISIS or al-Qaeda. It is aimed at young people who visit restaurants, go dancing, visit a football stadium or celebrate in a square.  That is why it is important for me to say very clearly: dear Member States, the exchange of data really needs to improve. Legal gaps that may have arisen in well-intentioned data protection must be corrected in such a way that the data can be exchanged consistently. We must also compare Eurodac data with the data of the perpetrators, so that terrorists cannot simply mix with refugees, so that others cannot say again that the border should be closed. No, if a terrorist hides somewhere in a plane, we do not ban air traffic, but we try to prevent them from getting on planes or mingling with refugees. We also need to significantly speed up and develop the methods of mutual legal and investigative assistance and the possibilities for doing so. We must transfer the offenders and dangerous persons fully into European databases, and not only in part, so that every country knows who is a criminal and who is a danger, and that we can act accordingly and inform the police authorities.  However, we must strengthen the backs of the police officers and not distrust them, because they have to fight these serious criminals on a daily basis and they need our trust, our support and not constant information about what they are doing wrong. Because it's easier to judge things from the sofa than actually standing outside and having to act. We must make use of the new technologies, and I would ask the Presidency of the Council to adopt both PNR and Europol quickly and all the issues relating to data protection and the data protection package and directive. One point is really important: drying up financial sources is a building block and the many building blocks that we need to address.

Ευχαριστώ γι' αυτό. Mr President, I am following this debate with great interest, as you will understand, and I want to express from the very beginning my thanks for your full support for our engagement and commitment to fight terrorism. This is a topic that leaves no one indifferent or uninterested and I believe that in this room we really foster a common consciousness beyond the fact that we are committed politically to fight terrorism.  Ms Sargentini, I would like to answer your question which is of great importance, although at the beginning in my introductory remarks I was very clear on that. Terrorist attacks, even the ones that are not organised by a wider network, cost money – money for equipment, for logistics, for falsified documents. I want to assure you that we shall follow that money to help and support the prevention and investigation of terrorist attacks. Soon we shall come back in order to discuss this issue further. I do not think I need to demonstrate or prove once more our commitment, as I said at the beginning, to the fight against terrorism and for the security of our citizens. I think we can all agree that much progress has been made to deliver our European Agenda on Security, but we are of course not there yet as long as the terrorist threat is still out there.  The threat we face is tangible and we need actions that can make a difference at all levels of our societies. We need each other to achieve results – the European Union institutions, Member State governments, national and also local authorities, law enforcement authorities, intelligence services, but also civil society.  I would like to come back to what I said at the beginning. Member States need to trust each other more. They need to share more information between themselves but also with Europol. On a personal basis I can say that I am not happy with their cooperation so far. Unfortunately, most of the Member States, I am sorry to say, keep the best of the information for themselves. Now is the moment to make a step forward.  Our work is not over. The Commission will enhance and redouble its efforts in this area in 2016. Concrete actions are on the horizon, particularly as regards terrorist financing. I count on your support in these efforts. We need to move forward quickly and effectively with European solutions to the common European problem of terrorism.

Let us start by saying that terrorism is a very multifaceted monster that requires a range of answers. There is not one simple answer to the threat of terrorism. I also fully understand the range of emotions that we have in this Parliament on this issue today. Let us remember first of all the victims and their families and their children, and I take that very seriously. In their honour, let me assure you that the Council very active in ensuring that we cooperate better, I will say something about that in a second. I would also caution against using the issue of terrorism for simple political agendas, be they from one side or from the other. We must be united in the fight against terror and understand that it is a very complex phenomenon – like an octopus – where we have to work on prevention and repression, on law enforcement and sharing, on trust between countries and on fighting Islamic State. If we do not work on that together and we just make this an element of political agendas then we are not going to move forward. I heard the words ‘political elite’ from – I think – Mr Buonanno. I am here representing not the Dutch Government but the Council, which is based on governments of different political persuasions and this is very difficult for me to hear. The Members here probably make EUR 100 000 per year, I do not know exactly. With all due respect parliamentarians and ministers make money, but if Mr Buonanno is part of the political elite then I am as well, and neither he nor I has a greater right to talk on behalf of the people than anyone else. Everybody is working, so am I. We are representing our people, we might have different views, but we are not going to have this debate on the basis of simplifications. We cannot accept that, the issue of terror is much too complicated. Let me say as well that if we are cool-headed and dare to analyse what is going on and we cooperate, then together we can move forward. But if we are going to work towards division, that is exactly what the terrorists want from us, namely to see us divide into opposing camps. Terrorism is a strategy that entails inspiring fear in the population and among politicians; if divisions between us appear then we are not going in the right direction. So let us be cool-headed, let us think through what we have to do. Yes that is prevention, yes that is repression, yes that is working together and yes that is fighting Islamic State. The Commissioner was very right to say this, and this is also what the Council is trying to do. We had a conference 10 days ago in the Netherlands which was based on the anti-ISIS coalition and the global coalition against terrorist fighters. What is the issue there? The issue is that we have to combine trust, share and stop.  We have to trust each other in ensuring that an exchange of information is taking place, and ask why it does not always happen and why should it happen more often. Everybody here has said that. The Council is in agreement with the Members on this. But it is very understandable to ask why we have to share information. That means, and that was the lesson from last week, cooperation between law enforcement, between intelligence, between civil society and others. It is a working method and we have to improve and increase and strengthen it. The strongest answer our societies can provide is resilience. Resilience and belief in our values, which are based on democracy and the rule of law. I say that not just to applaud these values; they are the only way to fight terror and come up with very, very concrete answers.  Let me say few things on that, because in the end it boils down to implementation. I agree with this. We can have all these debates. The Council is working in different areas to strengthen our cooperation. It is important that we reached an agreement between Parliament and the Council last December on PNR. Like the majority of MEPs in the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, the Council is confident that an EU PNR will have a major impact on detecting terrorist suspects. The European Union has already adopted a number of measures for the collection and exchange of personal data between law enforcement authorities, and the transfer and processing of PNR data aims to complement the existing tools. Organised crime and terrorist activities involve international travel and finance. This includes the smuggling of persons or drugs, or terrorists having access to training camps outside the European Union. PNR data will allow law enforcement authorities to identify persons who were previously not suspected of being involved in organised crime. It was – I think – Ms Hohlmeier who brought up the issue of a link between the agreement on the PNR directive and on the Data Protection Directive. I am aware of these concerns. I share them, President Schulz has passed them on to us, and we have replied to him. Our two institutions agree on the need to ensure that this vitally important legislation will be adopted and enter into force as soon as possible. You can be sure that the Council has taken and will continue to take all action required to ensure that these files are adopted with all due diligence, while also ensuring that their translation and legal linguistic revision are conducted in such a manner as to render the text as clear, consistent and legally sound as possible. We will ensure that our institutions continue to work as closely as possible – you have my commitment on this – and ensure that no avoidable delay occurs in the conclusion of these crucial dossiers. We have reached agreement on both files: PNR and data protection. Let me assure you we will not backtrack on our commitments. I said already something about the need to cooperate, whether obligatory or not. In my view, that is not the issue. As we know, under Article 42 of the TEU, national security remains the sole responsibility of each Member State. There is, accordingly, no legal basis for an EU intelligence agency. This does not mean that there is not an enormous need for this element of trust, share and stop. We are in the process of working in many different Council formations that sit on this. Let me also assure those who are worried about this that we are constantly talking about balance. I say to anybody who wants to have a simple agenda between privacy and repression, between thinking that it is all about the Qur’an or it has nothing to do with fundamentalist tendencies and that the issue is Islam: ‘Go ahead, it will not solve the issue’. The Council is working on a combined effort on prevention and repression. It is important that we take very seriously the issues of rule of law and of our values because that is exactly what is being attacked. The way we fight this awful scourge has to be within the limits. That is why we constantly continue to work on this issue. Yes, that means also prevention. That is not a soft policy. That is a very hard policy. It is ensuring that people do not get radicalised, and that also has to do with economic opportunity and discrimination. I say, not as a defence, that if we want to be effective we have to look at the whole chain of radicalisation and de-radicalisation. The closing of frontiers is not an answer to that. The same person who said we have to close the frontiers said that we need more international cooperation with the rest of the world right now. Let us do that. Our meeting last week included countries that are aware of this issue. We also have to strengthen our cooperation in the intelligence field, with countries in North Africa and elsewhere. In respect of the timetable for our cooperation it is important we have these debates regularly, and this is the case. It is also necessary that we as an executive be controlled by our national parliaments but also with a debate here.  We are faced with an enemy that has a great capacity to move around, and this has nothing to do with borders as we are talking about moving within our societies and internationally. We therefore have to step up our efforts. We have to share in the trust and to make sure that the divisions we have – which are legitimate – do not simultaneously lead to a lack of effectiveness against the threat of terror.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Strong measures to combat the financing of terrorism must also be put in place. The focus must be on the responsibility of some Gulf countries in the financing of terrorism. We also need a European TFTS, a system for detecting terrorist financing circuits, modelled on the agreement we have with the United States. What we have so far lacked is political will!

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. We have heard and read in the new trade strategy that global value chains also play a central role in Asia and the Pacific region and that these regions come into the focus of many trade contexts. This is particularly clear in view of the conclusion of the US Pacific Agreement with eleven partners, the TPP. In this respect, it is right and logical that we should also set out on our relations with Australia and New Zealand. The European Parliament has also held a workshop on this issue, and we have discussed this issue intensively of a trade agreement with New Zealand and Australia. It is clear, of course, that on the one hand we have a very close community of values with Australia and New Zealand. We are characterised by similar democratic structures and we are characterised by similar economic ideas. In this respect, there is a large basket of similarities. In terms of turnover of trade, Australia ranks 21st in trade relations between the European Union and New Zealand, not quite as at the centre of economic exchanges, but also not insignificant. On the other hand, of course, there are also sensitive sectors. Particularly in the agricultural sector – we have a heated debate on milk and sugar anyway – but also in the meat sector, as regards genetically modified organisms, and also with regard to the issue of sheep and sheepmeat. The question of geographical designations of origin is also handled differently in Europe and Australia. But, of course, we are on the way to establishing global rules, and that is right and necessary in the face of a globalised world. I and the committee firmly believe that these rules are, of course, best set with countries that are like-minded, democratically structured. In this respect, I also firmly believe that when we talk to Australia and New Zealand, we have more ambition to talk to them than we did in the Trans-Pacific Agreement, the TPP, which the United States negotiated. So far we do not have an impact assessment, nor do we yet have a scoping exercise. In this respect, we need a more detailed analysis of the consequences for such a trade agreement. And, especially before the question of the capacity of the European Commission, you should perhaps also mention, Commissioner, that this year was the first time that DG TRADE's staff had been cut. In view of this situation, the major challenges in the trade sector are, of course, difficult to achieve. I firmly believe that trade policy is a central instrument of European policy, and that is why we also need the DG TRADE to be equipped sensibly. We represent the interests of citizens and we represent the interests of the EU. That is why we need transparency and clarity, and that is why we have tabled a question for an oral answer, which will be supplemented by a motion for a resolution at the February II part-session. It is precisely the question of why the negotiations should start now, what risks we have in the face of TTP, what consequences an agreement with Australia and New Zealand will have in the Asia-Pacific region, and, of course, the question of which time component plays a role – we want to know all this from the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 73, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Bernd LANGE", "mepid": "1909", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Australia and New Zealand are the European Union’s like-minded partners, partners with whom we share so much in terms of common values and approaches, and strengthening these relationships is a priority. That is why, in 2015, the European Union concluded negotiations for political framework agreements with both Australia and New Zealand, with the aim of further strengthening these partnerships on the basis of joint values and principles such as respect for democratic principles, human rights and fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and the joint promotion of international peace and security.  The European Union has healthy and mature trade and investment relations with both Australia and New Zealand. The European Union is the biggest foreign investor, the biggest service trade partner and the third largest merchandise trade partner with Australia. The European Union is New Zealand’s largest source of merchandise imports, its second-largest source of service imports and its second-largest foreign investor. Australia and New Zealand have concluded free trade agreements with China, ASEAN, Japan, Korea, the United States and, most recently, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This leaves European exporters of goods, services and investors in a comparatively less favourable situation than their competitors in those countries. For example, in practice, cars imported from the European Union will only pay import duties to Australia once.  The European Union is the largest investor in Australia and the second largest in New Zealand, but Chinese investors still have easier access to Australia and New Zealand under their free trade agreements. The European Union also has strong interests in government procurement, where we aim to top up New Zealand’s and Australia’s commitments in the World Trade Organisation’s Agreement on Government Procurement. For the European Union, there are a number of well-known sensitive agricultural products such as dairy, beef, sheepmeat and sugar. It is worth noting that countries with well-known agricultural sensitivities, for example Japan and Korea, have managed to conclude free trade agreements with Australia and New Zealand, signalling that such sensitive issues can be managed. It is also worth noting that Australia and New Zealand already benefit from preferential access to the European Union for these sensitive products as a result of various tariff-rate quotas. As regards geographical indications, the European Union’s approach differs from New Zealand and Australia. New Zealand has announced that it will bring into force its Geographical Indications for Wine and Spirits Registration Act. In the case of Australia, we already have a wine agreement covering wine geographical indications. We want to see full protection of geographical indications beyond wines and spirits, including food products as well. The Free Trade Agreement negotiations would provide the opportunity to find solutions.  In recent meetings between the Presidents of the Commission and the Council and the Prime Minister of New Zealand in October last year, and separately with the Prime Minister of Australia in November last year, there was agreement to begin work towards the launch of negotiations on the respective free trade agreements. The Commission will carry out its impact assessment, including a public consultation. In parallel, the bilateral scoping exercise will be carried out. Both elements need to be finalised before the Commission requests authorisation from the Council to start negotiations.  The Commission will keep the European Parliament, notably through the Committee on International Trade (INTA) and INTA’s monitoring group for Australia and New Zealand, closely informed of developments as we take this important process forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Daniel CASPARY", "mepid": "28219", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has I am very grateful that today we have the opportunity to discuss the issue of Australia and New Zealand – the two free trade agreements. We have a situation where there are very, very few WTO Member States with which we are not yet negotiating trade agreements, or with which we have not concluded trade agreements – there are just six in number. If you look at the position of Australia and New Zealand, and bearing in mind that we share many of their values and beliefs, that is an argument why we should urgently start these negotiations.  Secondly, we have a situation where we have concluded or are in progress with many countries in the region. If we look at our trade agreement with South Korea, that is in force. If we look at our free trade agreements with Japan and other countries in the region that we are negotiating. We are negotiating an investment protection agreement with China.

The EU has actually been negotiating free trade agreements with many third countries for many years, creating stable economic relations which make economic growth possible and leave us less vulnerable in cases of instability. But we are still lagging behind in this field. The EU is the only big trading bloc which has not negotiated an FTA with one of the most important global economies, Australia. This is all the more surprising as the EU has long traditions with both Australia and New Zealand, cooperating closely in many fields, and we share the same fundamental values. Moreover, we should not be left behind and out of the circle which is starting to build up around Australia, New Zealand, Asia and North America. By deepening and strengthening cooperation and good relations with these countries, we could set international standards and promote fair and sustainable values for trade. So I have to ask the following question: why has the EU not yet started negotiations with Australia and New Zealand?

We need our own trade agreements with these countries to give our companies the means to export. Moreover, this is in a position to become one of the best free trade agreements we can have, and I expect the Commission to be very ambitious in terms of both regulatory harmonisation and, not least, data flows. These are probably two of the countries in the world closest to us and if we are to start working on building global standards, Europe will lead that process together with them closest to us. There are some accident ravens, I heard some here today, warning of agricultural products. Australia and New Zealand are major agricultural exporters, but I would remind you that they have a gigantic and growing regional market. And we're on the other side of the world. I don't think we need to think we're going to be the big market for Australia and New Zealand, no matter what the trade agreement delivers. I have two expectations of the Commission. The first is that these agreements are being used to make a new gold standard for European free trade agreements, that this will be the most ambitious that we have. The second expectation I have for the Commission is that it will not get bogged down in endless negotiations. This can be delivered quickly if you lie on it, and I expect the Commission to do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 82, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "David MARTIN", "mepid": "1403", "text": "   – Mr President, I also warmly welcome the Commission’s intention to open negotiations on these two free trade agreements.

Since the publication of the Commission’s new trade and investment strategy in which the strengthening of these relationships is considered a priority, there has been a positive drive towards the real start of the negotiations.  Having said that, one must wonder why it took us so long to engage in this direction. The EU has negotiated or started to negotiate agreements with all key trade partners but these two and this despite the fact that Australia and New Zealand are, except for geographically, our very close allies not only in bilateral trade, but also in multilateral trade agenda. The EU is Australia’s number one trade partner and key source of foreign investments too.

While it is essential to help strengthen the links between the Union and these two partner countries, the agricultural aspect of such agreements is very sensitive, and the European Union must not sell its agriculture on the altar of diplomacy. At a time when our livestock sectors, which produce meat and dairy products, are going through an unprecedented crisis, opening up the European market to such direct competitors would be dangerous.  Let me give you a few figures: New Zealand is the world's largest exporter of dairy products and the second largest exporter of milk powder. It is the world's fifth largest exporter of beef. Australia is the world's second largest exporter of milk and the third largest exporter of beef. Other sectors are also affected, such as large crops and sugar.

The proximity of values, for example in the field of data exchange, complementarity, which is particularly strong in the agricultural field due to the different seasons, and the low volume of trade guarantee a low level of risk for the European production sector.

I have been involved in the work of the Committee on Petitions since 2004, so I have been following its activities for more than a decade and watching how the results of this committee's work directly or indirectly affect EU legislation. At the legal level, citizens' complaints to the Committee on Petitions are a test of the implementation of Community law in the Member States. The number of petitions is still high, indicating that there is still a lack of proper compliance with the law or poor implementation of the law. The number of petitions, on the other hand, also shows the growing awareness of the citizens of the European Union and that they know that they can effectively assert their rights in the European Parliament.  In 2013, after an earlier annual steady increase in the number of petitions, we recorded a peak level of complaints received. In the 2014 report, there was a slight decrease. Statistics show that 2714 petitions were received by the European Parliament during the period in question, 6% less than in 2013. In addition, 1,877 petitions were closed in 2014, a nearly 10% increase over 2013 figures.  However, the duration of the petition is still not satisfactory. We must strive to ensure that each petition is able to be identified as soon as possible and, at the same time, that it is dealt with in an effective and effective manner.  I hope that with the use of advanced information technologies, our contacts with citizens will be more efficient and problems will be solved more quickly. A new web portal launched in November 2014 has already streamlined an earlier website-based system. Citizens submit petitions electronically through the new portal, have all the necessary information on Parliament's powers, can register, submit a petition, download supporting documents, get information on the stage of processing their petitions, and receive notifications in the form of automatically generated emails about changes in the status of petitions. Complainants are increasingly using the internet. 80% of petitions received in 2014 were emailed. In 2013, this percentage was 5% lower.  At the end of my speech, I would like to thank all the Members involved in the work on the report. Thanks to your commitment, we have been able to produce a report that better reflects the specificity of the work of the Committee on Petitions, and now I will be happy to hear your views.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 103, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Lidia Joanna GERINGER DE OEDENBERG", "mepid": "28377", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission generally welcomes Ms Geringer de Oedenberg’s report, which recognises the Commission’s role in assisting the Committee on Petitions with cases raised by petitioners. In 2014, of the 790 admissible and followed—up petitions, 688 were forwarded to the Commission.  The Commission shares the report’s opinion that there is a good working relationship between the Committee on Petitions and the Commission. It welcomes the more careful screening that has been put in place by the committee on which institution or body is the best place to respond to a given petition. The Commission does not, however, agree with the report’s observations that the Commission imposed restrictions on procedural grounds to inhibit inquiries into the substance of petitions or suggested closing files without waiting for the outcome of the examination of the issues they raise.  Indeed, the Commission would like to assure the honourable Members that it responds to all the requests of the Committee on Petitions which fall within its competence and endeavours to assist the committee as best it can. No procedural restrictions have ever been imposed concerning the handling of petitions. However, there may well be cases where the Commission cannot provide any detailed response to the committee as it has no competence in the matter. In such cases, the Commission informs the committee of the matter accordingly. Any decision to close a petition rests with the committee itself.  The report calls on the Commission to be represented in committee debates by an official with the highest possible rank. On this point, the Commission would like to reassure the committee that it always sends its most competent officials for the issues concerned to the PETI meetings, and has indeed not received any indications to date from PETI members or from the PETI secretariat that it was represented at an inappropriate level. Regarding the report’s call for the transposition of EU law, the Commission would like to recall that it actively remedies instances of incorrect transposition of EU law through the EU Pilot and infringement procedures. As part of the Better Regulation Agenda, the Commission has reinforced its preventive action to support Member States in the implementation process of Union legislation.  Turning to the issue of making information on the developments in infringement proceedings directly linked to petitions available to the committee, I would like to clarify that such information is already available. The Commission reports on its work in the annual report on monitoring the application of EU law, where it explains how it exercises its powers as guardian of the Treaties, including a follow-up to petitions received from Parliament.  The Commission also shares infringement-related information with Parliament, in line with the current framework agreement, and discloses information on infringement procedures in the form of press releases, in particular at the stages of reasoned opinion and referral to the court. In addition, the decisions on infringement proceedings can be consulted on the Commission’s searchable database available on europarl.eu. Moreover, the Commission is currently examining ways to improve the traceability of files on which petitions from Parliament are sent to the Commission. Turning to the Commission’s interpretation of Article 51 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it would like to recall that it is in line with the standing jurisprudence of the Court of Justice.  Regarding the report’s remarks on the European Citizens’ Initiative, the Commission remains fully committed to assisting the European Citizens’ Initiative’s work, so that it reaches its full potential. The Commission has already implemented – and will continue to implement – important measures to improve the functioning of the instrument under the current framework, in close cooperation with Parliament, the Member States and other EU bodies and stakeholders. The Commission provided Parliament with more detailed information in relation to these aspects in the plenary debate of 26 October 2015.  The Commission is considering further new actions to be implemented in several of the key areas highlighted in the Parliament Resolution on the European Citizens’ Initiative. However, as only three years have passed since the regulation’s effective entry into application, it is still too early to launch a legislative revision. The Commission will, however, continue to work in 2016 to further assess the possible need for such a revision at a later stage.  Turning to the calls on the Commission to implement the Ombudsman’s recommendations and to take into account the PETI Committee opinion on the TTIP negotiations, the Commission is committed to maximising transparency wherever this can be done without undermining their core elements of confidentiality, considered essential for the negotiations. Many of the Ombudsman’s recommendations have already been implemented or are in the process of being implemented. The Commission examined the citizens’ initiative on TTIP in the context of Article 11 of the Treaty of European Union, but it did not register it because the conditions laid down in Regulation No 211 of 2011 were not met.  The Commission welcomes the report’s observations on the importance of the European Year of Citizens and it will continue to provide information and sustained participation in European democracy in the future, including by means of citizens’ dialogue in the Member States. To this end, the Commission consistently deploys the Europe for Citizens’ programme, in the application of which projects strengthening and facilitating the participation and involvement of European citizens in the European decision-making process are being funded. Finally the Commission thanks the committee for its support for SOLVIT. The Commission agrees that SOLVIT should be further developed, and is currently working together with the Member States to develop SOLVIT to its full potential. In conclusion, I would like to reassure Parliament of the Commission’s continued and strong commitment to cooperating closely with it on petitions, which are a cornerstone of EU citizenship and a fundamental right under the Treaty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 104, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Heinz K.

I would like to ask a few questions about this report. Should the so-called wave reform for thousands of petitions, in the interests of the citizens, guarantee a rapid response and transparent processing of thousands of petitions associated with the General Secretariat of the European Parliament? Is the function of internal committee rapporteurs intended to ensure the greater efficiency of committee work? Should the importance and essential role of the European Court of Justice be explicitly emphasised? Should the Commission's role as guardian of the Treaties and the correct management of the EU institutions be highlighted? And is it to prevent fact-finding missions for political propaganda from being misused, especially before elections? I think you are more likely to say 'yes' to this spontaneously. It is therefore completely incomprehensible to me that the rapporteur has not shown cooperation, has not even sought to talk to me as the PPE's shadow rapporteur.

Thus, for the first time, Germany is called upon to place itself in public, in a European semi-judicial body such as the Committee on Petitions, on the issues of war reparations, forced occupation, compensation for the relatives of the thousands of Greek citizens executed by German occupying troops and those murdered in Nazi concentration camps.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 107, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Beatriz BECERRA BASTERRECHEA", "mepid": "125040", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to begin my speech by highlighting the special value and significance of the Committee on Petitions for Participatory Democracy and for this Parliament. It's the real window open to citizens. That more than 500 million Europeans, like those who accompany us here today, can directly move their demands to the House and set the political agenda, has a unique value. The figures reveal that the main concerns and complaints concern justice, the environment, the internal market and fundamental rights. As legislators, we have to take good note of that. It is striking and we should be concerned that countries like mine, Spain, are always at the forefront of the number of petitions , especially infringements – sharing a podium with Greece and Italy. I would like to ask your governments to implement these countries. I would like to stress the need for greater coordination and cooperation between the Commission and other institutions and bodies of the European Union, as well as with the national parliaments and with The Committees of this Parliament themselves.  The main challenge is to live up to citizens' expectations and be effective tools for asserting and defending their rights. Paragraph 21 is of particular significance to me, where we regret that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has not yet been adopted by all Member States and that its implementation is confusing.  Finally, I would like to stress that the strict interpretation of Article 51 of the Charter, under which the European Commission repeatedly declares it incapable of acting in the field of fundamental rights, is a challenge and a joint commitment which we must and will address immediately in this committee to adopt a new approach.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 108, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Marina ALBIOL GUZMÁN", "mepid": "125048", "text": "  GUE/NGL Group. – Madam President, that the European Union was built with its backs on citizens and thinking only of the interests of financial capital is a reality.

In times where many are calling the European project into question, the work of the Petitions Committee is more important than ever. The treatment that petitioners receive may shape their attitude towards the European Union for ever. Responsiveness to citizens is important, but not at the expense of the quality of our work. We need to finally address the ever-larger backlog of petitions by increasing the resources available to the committee. We must design the petition process with the petitioner in mind. That means simple, clear and transparent rules on admissibility of petitions. We have made some progress towards usability by introducing the petitions portal, but it still has fundamental flaws that need to be fixed for this portal to really provide an added value to people.  The most important task is to strengthen the quality of our follow-up. We need greater involvement of the other committees in the House in petitions that fall into their area of expertise. We need the Commission to step up its game and to take the inquiries more seriously. As the guardian of the Treaty, it is not the Commission’s role to repeat whatever Member State authorities say. After all, the right to petition is a fundamental right and it must be treated as such.  Unfortunately, the lack of commitment from the Commission is also apparent in its treatment of European Citizens’ Initiatives. The best way to frustrate people and to put them off civic engagement is introducing new participation instruments with huge entry barriers and then ignoring even those initiatives that have passed the hurdles. This treatment of ECIs has been repeatedly criticised by the European Ombudsman, whom I would like to thank on this occasion for her outstanding work in making the European Union more accountable and working with the Petitions Committee.

Madam President, the activity of the Committee on Petitions slowed down in 2014, with 2,714 petitions received, a decrease of 6% compared to 2013. Despite this, the Oedenberg report proposes to give additional resources to the Committee on Petitions. More means, but for what?  In 2014, 1,070 petitions received were declared inadmissible, 760 admissible and 817 closed. Many petitions are inadmissible, because the scope of the European Union's competences is not well known to citizens. Similarly, the criteria for processing petitions are not always legal or technical, but are also political; it can also discourage citizens.  But the main substantive issue in the report is participatory democracy, with European citizens' initiatives. It is clear that on this subject it is a failure. On the one hand, because these initiatives do not repeal legislation or stop preparatory work, but, on the other hand, because these initiatives are trampled on by the European Commission when they do not go its way. We saw this with the rejection of the European Citizens' Initiative against the transatlantic treaty: despite more than 3 million signatures collected, the European Commission refused to register it. To justify itself, it claimed that the negotiation of the treaty was not only its responsibility, but also that of the European Council. However, a precedent exists: in 2013, the \"Swiss-out\" initiative on the free trade agreement between Switzerland and the European Union was registered by the Commission. It is clear that the Commission's technical arguments conceal political biases. Similarly, when the Commission registers initiatives, nothing happens. We have seen this with vivisection and the right to water. So, for lack of results, Europeans are becoming discouraged and increasingly turning away from citizen initiatives, as they are turning away from petitions.

But, of course, there are still reserves. I would like to emphasise three, in addition to the things that Mr Becker has already mentioned.  Firstly, it is important that we distinguish more clearly and more quickly between admissible and inadmissible petitions and petitions where we do not have competence. This simply saves time to deal more intensively with the petitions for which we are quite simply responsible. Secondly, we should pay more attention to compliance with the time regime, which means the so-called wave reform or the life circle of petitions. For me, this means that nine months after the petition has been submitted, the petition must be submitted to the committee for an initial consultation or a first decision.  Thirdly, there are petitions in which the members of the committee believe that existing laws need to be amended or improved. We need to improve cooperation with the specialist committees more clearly here. This also applies to cooperation with the petitions committees of the national parliaments, because I think we still have the greatest reserves here. I also want to do not forget to get rid of a thank you to the staff of the Committee on Petitions, who do not always have it easy with us as members of the Committee on Petitions. But we always argue and fight for the cause or in the matter. I think that the Committee on Petitions is, for me, a democracy in the European Union. Citizens can contact the European Union directly, which means that the Committee on Petitions is, for me, the seismographer. We, the members of the Committee on Petitions, feel directly, we know exactly what is going on in Europe.

It does not only give the full view of what has been done in 2014, but it also represents a possible change for the future in the way we handle the petitions in our committee. The proper treatment of EU citizens who exercise their right to petition is very important: it influences trust in the Petitions Committee, and it also gives a certain credibility to EU institutions. I support the idea that petitions are the major instrument for our citizens to be more effectively involved in the democratic process of the EU and at EU level.  In this regard, I believe that the EPP plenary amendments are crucial to this report, because they clearly indicate the obligation to comply with the administrative procedure. This is very important, because we tend to fail to realise that the administrative procedure is very important in our work. These rules are guiding principles in the whole lifecycle of the petition, and this makes the whole mechanism more focused on real results. Whatever we do, we have to make sure that we don’t give false hopes to the petitioners. We have to handle the petitions in a more transparent way, we have to make sure that citizens are properly addressed and that their issues are properly addressed in our committee, and we have to reduce the likelihood of politicisation of our agenda.  There is still a lot to be done in in our committee, but I am certain that we can win this battle to find a proper definition of the admissibility of petitions.

Thanks to the work of the Committee on Petitions, problems can be removed in the process of implementing EU law. These tasks and objectives make the process of improving the functioning of the Committee on Petitions ongoing. Members of the EPP Group committees are actively involved in this process.  One of the amendments proposed by our group, which the rapporteur does not take into account, is to motivate Member States to regulate by law the obligation to set up a committee on petitions in national parliaments. This issue was discussed in 2015 with members of the Committee on Petitions. Not all parliaments of the Member States have such committees in their structures, and such a solution would significantly affect the effectiveness of the Committee on Petitions' cooperation with national parliaments. This would allow national parliaments to be transferred to matters which are not part of the Union's activities.  Another amendment not included also concerns childcare. After all, children are cared for not only by parents who are formally married, but also by couples living in free relationships. Not taking this into account can have serious consequences in childcare disputes.  An important amendment concerns the length of the work on petitions. As a member of the working group on petitions on children, I am opposed to artificially keeping open petitions on which we lack competence. Such a state only increases the bad hopes for a positive outcome. I therefore call for its adoption.

The petition is a gateway to the European Union in the eyes of citizens, and it is helping us members and the other EU institutions to do our job. However, the report states that the number of petitions received is modest in relation to the total population of the Union. I can confirm that from my own experience. As a Hungarian-spoke citizen and representative in southern Slovakia, I have received numerous requests. I am not saying that every single problem can be the subject of a petition, but I am saying that a lot of it would probably be in line with a petition. In the areas of fundamental rights, discrimination, free movement and environmental protection referred to in the 2014 Activity Report, there are problems and legitimate grievances in the EU civil law that would indeed be investigated by the Committee on Petitions. I would therefore like to continue to draw particular attention to information. The vast majority of citizens either do not know or know little about the right to petition. In the statistics of the previous year, the number of petitions in Hungarian or even Slovak is very high. I therefore see my role as Vice-President of PETI primarily in bringing our work and the right to petition closer to central Europeans.

With regard to EU exports, I believe, in agreement with the rapporteur, that transitional periods for the gradual reduction of customs duties on industrial, agricultural, processed agricultural and fishery products and wine and spirits for Kosovo will be essential for the smooth establishment of the FTA for the planned 10 years, given that the EU's external trade surplus with Kosovo is significant and has increased slightly over the last few years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 202, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Francisco de Paula GAMBUS MILLET", "mepid": "125006", "text": "  in writing.

But it is essential that they move forward in a way that ensures adequate protection of the environment and public health and not the protection of the interests of multinationals – against populations and the environment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 408, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Harald VILIMSKY", "mepid": "125001", "text": "  Writing.

Finally, Parliament stresses the importance of raising public awareness and visibility of the benefits of the Association Agreement, including through regular contacts with civil society organisations, and to simplify and promote objective, independent and impartial information on this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 437, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Andrea BOCSKOR", "mepid": "124712", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine have come a long way to engage in Democratic Reforms with a European spirit, breaking with the post-Russian operating system.

In its resolution on the evaluation of the implementation of trade and association agreements with Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova, the European Parliament called on the European Commission to continue to support countries in the implementation of the agreements, both in technical and financial form. He also called for the results of structural and social reforms carried out in the above-mentioned countries to be presented. However, it is also important to pay attention to the external aspect of these agreements and, in particular, to Russia's actions towards the countries of the former Eastern Bloc, which have undertaken closer cooperation with the European Union. An example would be Ukraine, which has been benefiting from a trade agreement with the Community since the beginning of the year. Russia, convinced that the agreement would hit its interests, decided to introduce tariffs and an embargo on Ukrainian products, which will have a very negative impact on the weakened Ukrainian economy.

Terrorism has no borders, so there must be full exchange of information, full cooperation between the security services and a common fight against terrorism; the causes of terrorism must be eliminated.

The French President pointed out that France refers to Article 42(7) and not to the so-called solidarity clause, article 222 of the Treaty on European Union. While the latter paves the way for greater EU involvement, the former operates in an intergovernmental formula, allowing Paris to play a greater role.

However, it is important to remember that these terrorist attacks were not only an attack on France or Parisians, but rather were intended as aggression against the entire European Union and the ideals of liberal democracy; so all those who identify with European culture and civilization were the indirect targets of terrorists. It is therefore absolutely essential to respond with a single European voice. This proposal is also important because it will set a precedent for the EU's future common foreign and security policy. One of the reasons for the success of these terrorist attacks was that European intelligence and security services were unable to cooperate and coordinate effectively.

Parliament is also concerned about constitutional revisions that allow for changes to the maximum number of presidential terms and condemns the continued use of harassment and detention of human rights defenders and opposition figures by government forces in a number of third countries. It reaffirms the EU's zero tolerance for the death penalty and torture, recalls the fundamental right of free elections by universal suffrage and emphasizes respect for economic and social rights that have been undermined, notably by rising poverty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 766, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Brando BENIFEI", "mepid": "124867", "text": "  in writing. \\u2012 Today I supported the motion for a resolution on the EU's priorities for the 2016 sessions of the UN Human Rights Council.

In addition, it is deeply concerned about the extreme increase in poverty, which threatens the full enjoyment of all human rights, and it is therefore essential to give economic, social and cultural rights the same meaning and priority as civil and political rights, to recognise the right to social protection, to implement fiscal policies specifically aimed at reducing inequalities, to give new impetus and importance to the right to equality and to raise resources as a key issue in the debate on human rights.

Universal human rights, advocated by both the UN and the EU, are an important segment that needs to be paid a great deal of attention, as human rights violations are becoming more and more severe.  The EU's role in the protection of human rights within the UN is therefore of paramount importance, but there are a number of shortcomings that make it difficult to act effectively. Indeed, the EU cannot act as a single entity within the UN, as the UN's action is directed at individual countries and not so much interstate organisations such as the EU.  The EU itself also has problems with a patchy foreign policy, which is why it does not play the most important role in international relations. The interests of individual Member States play a significantly greater role here, and the interest of the EU as a whole is often sidelined, as it is often difficult to identify, let alone defend.

What needs to be highlighted is the universality of human rights and their indivisible character.

As such, the report challenges the Commission's refusal to accept the European Citizens' Initiative against the transatlantic agreement, even though it has received more than 3 million signatures.  But under the guise of giving more powers to citizens through petitions, in reality it is a matter of strengthening the control of the European Commission, a democratically illegitimate body, over the Member States and speeding up the implementation of the 'internal market law'. In view of the economic, social and political context, real democratic improvements are not to be sought in improving on the margins of a right to petition that has so far not proven its effectiveness against austerity.

All EU citizens can raise their concerns about EU legislation to the EP through the right of petition.

In my view, three things are problematic: firstly, at 40%, we still have too many petitions which do not fall within the competence of our committee. This shows the still great lack of understanding among the population of how the EU works and what institutions it has. On the other hand, we are dealing with a massive politicisation of the Committee on Petitions. For example, petitions are often only allowed out of tactical calculation, for example in an election. We therefore need clear legal criteria in the Rules of Procedure of the Committee on the Treatment of Petitions. Thirdly, we must limit the sometimes very long length of proceedings.

We also welcome how the report highlights and gives voice to the large number of requests on issues of great importance such as: citizen rejection of TTE and its opacity; rejection of fracking and oil exploration; reporting the problems and rights of persons with disabilities; the fight for children's rights; and all the problems of migration, hot returns, refugees, etc. Therefore, although the inclusion of participation in the European institutions is insufficient, I vote in favour of a report which seeks to give voice and improve this type of participation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 1060, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Ramon TREMOSA i BALCELLS", "mepid": "97203", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I welcome this report, and particularly the good practices of the Scottish Parliament in its visit to the European Parliament in order to understand better the petition mechanism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1061, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "István UJHELYI", "mepid": "124705", "text": "  Writing. ‒2,714 petitions were received in 2014, a 6% decrease from 2013.

Better late than never. And I hope that our decision will provide support both to the European External Action Service and to the governments of the Member States so that this incident is to be put to an end. The Greens were the only ones who did not start to link the Seaman Guard Ohio case to the Case of the Italian Marines, convinced that ultimately linking different cases would not help anyone, rather creates additional problems. I am pleased that Estonian ambassadors from the EPP and ALDE groups finally understood this fact. And I would like to thank my colleagues from Italy – Lara Comi, Massimo Castaldo and Mr Panzer , who understood and took into account the views of the Greens. I can assure you that, in turn, they can count on my support if the problem of Italian marines comes before Parliament. And I would also like to thank the Head of the Indian Delegation, Geoffrey van Orden, who has been actively looking for a solution to the problem in relation to his profession, and Nirj Dva for his help in obtaining information from India.  For the reasons set out above, the Greens did not join the compromise resolution, but also asked to leave to the vote their own text, which is free from unnecessary praise for the specificity of the Indian judicial system (unfortunately, such phrases are found in the joint resolution). We in This Parliament are not in diplomatic service, where, in some cases, polite phrases and flatterment are appropriate, our resolutions must state the facts, otherwise they will have no desired effect.  As far as the joint resolution is concerned, point two is just funny. India is a country with a population of 1.2 billion, with 1.2 million inhabitants in Estonia.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would also like to thank my group, which has today supported a resolution in this House aimed at supporting a major national issue in my country, Italy. Freedom for the two Navy riflemen, one of whom is still detained, imprisoned in India and both still sub judice, pending the results of an arbitration procedure, with results not very close, which however see the solution to their story still a long way off, is thought even beyond 2018. The President-in-Office of the Council of our country says that Italy is a great country, quite right! I also pay tribute to this statement. But a large country defends its soldiers, especially if they are prisoners abroad and I do not think it can be said objectively that more has been done, if not a weak and in some cases cumbersome and bungled defence. In this whole delicate affair, however, there is a power which, if possible, appears even weaker and more disastified, european power. In the case of the two maròs, too, the question arises: 'but where is this Europe?' It should defend us against Isis and it seems that it is unable to defend two soldiers, who are, among other things, engaged in the fight, which involves us all, against the crime of international piracy. And I would say that you should also defend another very important point, that of their military honour, because these accusations violate their military honour. There is a doubt that this is precisely what can be the reason for the lack of commitment, perhaps because the military honour of its citizens is of little interest to the European Union. This aspect must also be considered. On such a long-winded affair that only now, laboriously, has it taken the path that perhaps could have been the main route of international arbitration. The voice of Europe, dear High Commissioner Mogherini, seems feeble, in any case very ineffective, given the results, when it might be, the fate of those who, like our marò, defend a fundamental principle of freedom on the seas, should be very important. Well, I believe that the Commission must reassess all EU-India relations, starting with the suspension of all ongoing negotiations with India, first and foremost the free trade agreement.

The motor vessel Seaman Guard Ohio was just such a floating armoury and on 11 October 2013 it was apparently in Indian territorial waters when it was intercepted by the Indian Coastguard and escorted to the port of Tuticorin. Subsequently all 35 members of the crew, including 14 Estonians and six Britons, were charged, and they are the subject of this resolution. After some legal arguments and to our great consternation they were eventually brought to trial and given the maximum sentence of five years’ imprisonment. Throughout this period of over two years they have been held in custody in India.  I have to say we respect India’s sovereignty over its territory and waters and the fact that it has a fine legal tradition. We know also that India has suffered from atrocious terrorist attacks, some mounted from the sea. We therefore understand very well Indian sensitivities.

Most of our Italian colleagues have insisted that their case should be separated from today’s discussion, but our sympathy and solidarity go to our Italian colleagues as well.

What is interesting is that they were not accused of robbery, armed attacks or illegal trade. Twenty EU citizens have been accused of entering Indian waters, having arms on board – which is natural for men engaged in anti-piracy operations – and buying gasoline from an unofficial source. That is all. I think it would be fair to assume that clearing up such accusations could have taken a few months. Instead, our co-citizens have waited nearly two and a half years, having been cleared from accusations by one Indian court and due to be sentenced this month by another court to five years’ imprisonment. We are not here today to question India’s sovereignty or legal system, but this is a gesture of goodwill, in an atmosphere of mutual friendship and sympathy, to relieve the desperate situation of 20 men who have spent nearly two and a half years away from their families.

We like to call India the largest democracy state in the world, but we must not forget that the mere existence of democratic procedures alone does not guarantee that human rights will be respected, nor, alas, guarantee a fair trial. I do not want to make an assessment of the correctness of the application of these local laws to the Indian court, but I would point out that, under international law, the procedure has been too long. At the same time, the living conditions of estonian and other seafarers were very difficult. Not being entitled to work, at the same time, sailors were practically in debt, and this situation put their families in a very serious state of financial gain.

I recognise the Indian Government has legitimate concerns over illegally held weapons and I understand their reasonably held worries since the events in Mumbai in 2008, but as far as I can see the British citizens involved – including Nick Dunn from my constituency in Ashington – also had a reasonable belief: they believed that they were acting in accordance with the law. They believed that they were fighting against piracy, working for an American company. They did not believe they were doing anything contrary to the law or to the best interests of India, nor did they even necessarily know that the weapons were illegally held. In such a case, I really wonder whether their continued imprisonment really serves any public interest.

We share the concerns raised by many of you. Two years of uncertainty have contributed to the agony of all involved. We have followed closely the situation of the Estonian and UK security guards, liaising with the Estonian and UK authorities, as it pertains to the protection of EU citizens.  This case has been raised by the EU with Indian interlocutors several times over the last few months. This case has a negative bearing on the global fight against piracy at a time when we, the international community, should foster cooperation and focus on countering new threats.  We have recently learned that a Tamil Nadu court has sentenced the guards to five years in prison and a fine, reversing the lower court’s acquittal. We understand that they are now considering an appeal to the court’s decision; this came as unexpected news. Allow me to fully subscribe to what the Estonian Foreign Minister, Ms Marina Kaljurand, has said: ‘From a human standpoint, I was undoubtedly hoping for a positive outcome, but regardless of the verdict we will continue to act in the name of returning the men home’.  A solution must be found at the earliest. We will continue to liaise with Estonian and UK authorities in the coming weeks, during the next phases of the judicial process. As regards the case of the two Italian marines, while fully respecting the content and scope of the European Parliament resolution to be voted on today, I wish to reiterate that a solution must be found at the earliest. The European Union has been regularly raising this issue for the past four years at all levels with Indian interlocutors, always with the same message, advocating a rapid and consensual solution in respect with international law. Respect of international law means not only full compliance with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), but also with the UN conventions on human rights. The decision to initiate an international arbitration in the framework of UNCLOS is consistent with international law and a step in the right direction.

It is true that this is a long and complex resolution, and that is inevitable when we talk about Ethiopia. There is a very clear starting point, which is what we want to denounce here: the government crackdown on peaceful demonstrations by farmers and herders protesting the attempt to expand the municipality of Addis Ababa, an attempt that fundamentally affected their way of life and exposed them to leave them in the open. These demonstrations were savagely suppressed and, according to the testimonies of human rights defenders, caused at least one hundred and forty dead. That's the urgent point that brings us here today. But it was inevitable, too, and that is why the extension of this Resolution, to contextualize, to talk about what is going on, in general, in Ethiopia. And what is Ethiopia right now? A country with a failed democracy, hijacked by a single party regime. A country where repression of various ethnic groups, such as the oromo or the Ogadén, is systematically practiced. A country full of displaced people, refugees, many of whom flee to our Europe. A country where counter-terrorism laws are applied that coerce freedom of expression, where arbitrary arrests are made, where members of NGOs are persecuted and where citizens of the European Union are also imprisoned. It is true that it plays a key role in the region, but that should not serve as an excuse for our position, the position of the European Union, which must demand attention and compliance with all the human rights provisions that are in Ethiopia's own Constitution. Ethiopia is also one of the poorest countries in the world. Those of us who have been there have seen levels of misery that I don't think can be overcome.

We are discussing the issue of human rights in this state, in Ethiopia, again here in plenary after a few months. This action has triggered what has happened in Ethiopia over the last two months, which has been mentioned here by my colleagues. In short, at the end of last year, over one hundred and forty people were brutally killed in peaceful demonstrations in Addis Ababa. These people, members of the Orom ethnic group, peacefully protested against the change of Addis Ababa's zoning plan, so that they would lose their pastures and be expelled from their territory. It is clear that the human rights situation in Ethiopia is constantly deteriorating, which is why we have this point here and we need to discuss it, say, as an institution that deals with the human rights situation in the world. It is quite clear that, at the moment, the European Union must protest against the ethiopian government's handling of the political opposition, how it imprisons political leaders, how the Ethiopian Government handles independent media, where the state and the right to free expression are clearly suppressed. Ethiopia is among the 10 countries where journalists' rights in the world are most suppressed. In this way, we could talk about the non-profit sector, about ordinary, say, activists who are also imprisoned, and the legislation in this country is that you can more or less not carry out a non-profit, non-state activity here.  On the other hand, there are 700 000 refugees in this country, there is a huge climate problem and this country needs help. It needs help from us, from the European Union, but we must, and this is my call to the Commission, link this assistance to the human rights situation and the state of democracy in this country.

The repression against the Oromo community, which is revolting because it is threatened with expulsion from its territory, the most fertile in this country, under the guise of major industrial and urban projects, is symptomatic of this drift. In addition, Ethiopia is preparing for the largest drought in 50 years due to climate change. A humanitarian catastrophe is looming. Ten to fifteen million people are reported to be in need of food aid this year, including five million children. The country is also home to more than 800,000 refugees. It is representative of the migratory evolution of the countries of the African continent, all of which become more or less countries of origin, reception and transit.  The European Union wants to make it, through the Khartoum process, one of the key partners in the new migration policies. I have, at the very least, concerns that development aid will be diverted to the European obsession with sending back migrants, with Ethiopia serving to receive the rejected from the European Union from other countries in the Horn of Africa.

Our consistent message is that economic and social development must go together with political and human rights to make it sustainable.  A strong civil society and freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly are crucial for creating a more prosperous, secure and more economically successful country. In that context, the European Union is following recent unrest in Oromia, triggered by the urban expansion plans for Addis Ababa city, closely and with concern. There were also ethnic clashes in the Amhara region, which received less attention from the media but which also resulted in casualties.  On 23 December 2015, the European External Action Service spokesperson called for a peaceful resolution of the disputes. These events show the importance of constructive dialogue to address grievances. We called for clarity on all acts of violence and abuses perpetrated against protesters, as well as accountability for such violations. We have raised these concerns with the Ethiopian authorities in Addis, and most recently in Brussels when the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Tedros Adhanom came to visit High Representative/Vice-President Mogherini on 13 January. He recognised the situation and informed us that the Addis Ababa expansion master plan had been discarded.  Ethiopia is facing many other challenges, where we are also working with the government. The population has grown dramatically in recent decades, now reaching over 100 million people. This is a challenge in terms of job creation, service delivery and poverty reduction. The effects of two consecutive droughts and of El Niño have left 10.2 million people in need of food assistance, in addition to eight million already benefiting from government programmes.  This endangers the social and economic development of the country. In this context the European Union provides, and will continue to provide, political and financial support for improving the human rights situation in Ethiopia, but also for supporting, in parallel, efforts by the government in terms of poverty reduction, economic and social development and humanitarian issues.  Ethiopia is the biggest beneficiary of the 11th European Development Fund’s bilateral development envelope of EUR 745 million, complemented by regional and thematic programmes and Emergency Trust Fund operations for stability and addressing root causes of irregular migration and displaced persons in Africa.  Despite these immense needs, Ethiopia has an open door policy and is the largest refugee-hosting country in Africa, with over 700 000 refugees. In the EU, we shall provide support on this issue through the Regional Development and Protection Programme for the Horn of Africa, as well as through the recently signed Common Agenda on Migration and Mobility.  Ethiopia is an important partner for the European Union in many areas – migration, climate change, regional peace and stability to name but a few. We enjoy a constructive engagement on all these aspects that are important to Europe, to Ethiopia and to the region. In the same vein, the European Union will resolutely continue to stress the importance of human rights in Ethiopia and support the country in respect of the fundamental freedoms of its citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1111, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.

What does exist is an armistice signed some 63 years ago, and the entire construct of the Republic of Korea and the DPRK is built on an armistice.

I want to keep our relationship with North Korea open even though they are playing some a dangerous game, which is not of any value as I see it, either to themselves, or to global peace.

Mr President, this debate on North Korea is very important for a number of reasons. First of all, it is part of the condemnation movement after the recent nuclear test that North Korea has boasted about. This test was conducted in violation of all UN Security Council resolutions and represents a very serious threat to the stability of the Korean peninsula.  The second main reason is that this year there was a Korean candidate for the Sakharov Prize. Reverend Hyeon, who has devoted his entire life to defending human rights in North Korea, has unfortunately not been formally nominated for lack of support. Awarding the Sakharov Prize to a North Korean human rights defender would be an essential step in the fight for respect for human rights.  The impact of the Sakharov Prize on the countries concerned has yet to be proven, it has in the past revived the debate on the issue of human rights and encouraged civil society to become more involved. That is why I would like to take this opportunity to invite our colleagues who really want to help North Korea support such an approach this year. No one from North Korea has ever been at least an official candidate for the nomination and that is absurd, because it is one of the last totalitarian countries. The award has been given to important people, I think we must also take this step towards North Korea. It is important that Parliament sends a strong message to Korea, and that these human rights situations remain a priority for foreign policy. In this sense, we call in our resolution, Mrs Mogherini, to closely monitor the situation in this country and to maintain constant pressure on this regime. I wanted to put North Korea back on the agenda of our resolutions, because I refuse to associate myself with the pessimism about North Korea's capacity for change. The people of North Korea deserve a constant commitment from us, the regime will not undertake any reform on its own initiative.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which There are conflicts and developments in the world where one wonders why the political reason of the world community does not manage to bring it to a political solution. For me, the conflict on the Korean peninsula is one of them. We know its roots, its historical course, its participants and their rhetorical templates. We know the rituals by which the conflict is organized: this eternal pendulum between pushing forward and rowing back, confrontation and dialogue, opening up and walling in. The overall situation is reminiscent of the time when the block confrontation had clearly reached its limits and yet everything was somehow in a balance, in a kind of balance, where the war was not a real political option, but always a rhetorical one. This is exactly how the situation is today. Even after North Korea's latest nuclear test, everyone is already back to their routines, everyone is talking about destabilizing effects, but no one is really acting. Even the UN Security Council, with its unanimous resolution 2094 of March 2013, has virtually been working on a stockpile of sanctions for the latest nuclear test. I wonder if there is speculation that the social system in North Korea has fallen out of time in such a way that it will have to collapse. This would be a serious mistake, because the CVR, despite all sanctions, has high economic growth, is on the verge of self-sufficiency in food, and is far from excluded from international world economic processes. Let's see: The apps on our i-Phones are produced in North Korea. Where you simply shoot political opponents from your own family, you cannot talk about human rights. Where political power can be inherited, there is no democracy. Where work is brutally expropriated by the state, pathos may be centrally organized, but never preserved social participation and legitimacy.

Unfortunately, nothing has changed in that time, as the UN Commission of Inquiry notes in 2014. It is very sad that people in North Korea continue to suffer from hunger, while their government finances research and production of nuclear weapons and security services to monitor and persecution their own citizens. Negotiations on disarmament, nuclear disarmament and respect for human rights are blocked by North Korea. At the same time, I must say that this is a beautiful country with natural riches and gifted people, and it could be as rich, as developed as South Korea, which is not giving up hope of joining. For mr. Scholz: the solution is not on South Korea's side, the solution is in the hands of north Korea's authoritarian government. South Korea is closely monitoring North Korea's development and also has the best understanding of how its development can be influenced. That is why I recommend, and the European Parliament resolution also mentions this, so that the European Commission should use the expertise to produce the European Union's strategy precisely by South Korea, which has these expertise.

Basically, we could talk about North Korea at every point of human rights violations in our plenary session, and so for years, which shows that this is an extremely complex problem, of course, above all for the people of North Korea itself, but the signs show that this threat is also increasing for the countries around us. Unfortunately, you can learn from recent years how the world has missed a number of problems – in the sense that if intervention had been made in time, there would have been no greater trouble. I fear that it may be the same as the discussed, the talk, but those who could exert real pressure on North Korea are modest. I am thinking, above all, of China, to a certain extent also of Russia.

The situation calls for urgent systematic and structural changes in North Korea. This is a moral and legal imperative, but also a very practical necessity.  The situation as it stands is a recipe for long-term regional instability. I would like to recall that some of the findings of the Commission of Inquiry even point to possible crimes against humanity. For that reason, the European Union has supported the recommendation that the UN Security Council refers the situation in North Korea to the International Criminal Court. The European Union has been and will remain at the forefront of keeping this dire state of affairs at the centre of attention of the international community. Our work at the UN is clear testimony of that. But the EU’s goal is not securing headlines or condemnation; our prime objective is achieving concrete improvements on the ground. That is what matters the most. The European Union is already financing a number of food security, health, water and sanitation projects in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea that are of direct benefit to some of the most vulnerable people in the country, including some children in care institutions, the elderly, people with impairments and vulnerable farming communities.  The European Union is ready to do more and to cooperate further with North Korea, but only if it starts to address credibly and substantially its major and serious human rights deficiencies. If North Korea decides to follow the path of real engagement on human rights, starting with full cooperation with the UN Human rights mechanisms, then it will manage to secure a real, effective security in ways that illegal nuclear weapons will never provide. But recent actions by North Korea – the illegal nuclear test that it conducted on 6 January – show that we are not yet on a positive path and our ability to cooperate remains severely limited as a result. North Korea should focus on the much-needed human rights reforms that its citizens require, not on destabilisation and illegal actions that create an insecure and threatening environment to the detriment of all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1139, "date": "2016-01-21.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   I close the debate.
