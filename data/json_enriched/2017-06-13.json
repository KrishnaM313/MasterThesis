In fact, this regulation brings within the European regulations some concepts relating to the energy efficiency of electrical equipment and their potential dynamic interaction with electrical networks. I was learning these notions ten years ago, when I was practicing dentistry and, out of pure popular passion, I translated essays on environmental sustainability into Italian. I could never have imagined being here one day to represent millions of citizens and to have the honor of translating into European legislation what were at the time some experimental proposals by Lester Brown and others. Smart appliances are appliances, such as dishwashers and washing machines, that can be programmed by the user, so that they come into operation when electricity is available in more abundant and cheaper quantities. The widespread use of smart appliances will be able not only to save users money, but also to provide a not insignificant contribution to the balancing of an electricity system powered by renewable sources in an ever increasing extent. Imagine a citizen producing wind or photovoltaic energy. Some equipment in his house will be able to come into operation and carry out their activity when self-production is more abundant. Imagine the old and antiquated electric water heater, which by its nature is not particularly efficient in purely thermodynamic terms, but if the water heater will heat the water when the electricity is cheaper and more abundant, the accumulated heat will be a form of energy source. low price. Smart appliances mark a new milestone in energy efficiency not only in quantity but also in quality, not only in terms of how much energy is consumed, but also when it is used. That is why I am excited, because behind this text there is a small piece of utopia that is turning into reality for 500 million citizens. The demonstration that one can believe in an idea, however distant it may seem, and piece by piece, with perseverance and determination, get to realize it. This regulation, for the first time, gives manufacturers the possibility to indicate on the label the ability of a device to be energy smart. This little thing allows the new labeling regulation to be in step with the times and to enter fully into the new dynamic, decentralized and renewable energy model, which we want to pursue with the Energy Union. An Energy Union that has among its declared objectives also that of having the citizen at its center. Well, together with the new labels, an open data database will be created to which it will be possible to connect directly through a mobile phone, a QR Code, a link or the like, present on the paper label, and will be able to provide buyers, in the 24 languages ​​of the Union, with only a series of information impossible to cram onto a piece of paper, but it will also allow the development of smartphone applications that will allow citizens and businesses to make immediate comparisons between different models and to choose the one that offers the best result in terms of initial investment and savings over time, not compared to a generic average but in relation to personal usage habits. I have listed two things that I have fought for and that I am proud of, there would be others as well. However, if I have to be intellectually honest, as is my habit, I also feel the duty to share a concern with you. At the beginning of this process, I made a promise that I would be guided by three keywords: smart, paperless and trust. Without a doubt we are facing to a smart regulation in which the use and importance of paper support is reduced in favor of a more fruitful use of digital document technologies and online databases. It is true that this regulation undoubtedly strengthens national market surveillance authorities, but we would have liked more. We would have liked to have provided compensation from the manufacturers in case it is discovered one day that the energy performance of a product is lower than that declared. Parliament wanted it tightly, but unfortunately we found a wall in front of it, the wall of the Council that prevented it. It prevented EU citizens from having the same right as, for example, US citizens defrauded by Volkswagen, who were reimbursed. However, we have obtained from the European Commission, which I thank, a written commitment annexed to this regulation, to study the possibilities of eliminating this absurd legislative gap, which we believe is a real scandal.

The energy label is a European success story. It is present in every household and is known to most consumers in the EU. Over 80% of citizens are familiar with the energy label and use it when they buy a new device. Electrical appliances such as washing machines, refrigerators or dishwashers have become more and more efficient in recent years due to technological progress, so that most of them now have the best, i.e. the A +++ class. In the case of washing machines, that's 73% of all models in this class, so that it is hardly possible to differentiate between the best devices. In addition, we now have an inconsistent classification of the efficiency classes. For vacuum cleaners, A is the best, for washing machines it is the worst efficiency class. And that is totally misleading for consumers. Therefore a reform of the energy label was necessary to end the big mess in the market with misleading energy labels. The new energy label with a uniform scale from A to G for all product groups will enable consumers again to actually save electricity and money. With a meaningful energy label, every household can save up to EUR 500 in energy costs each year, and thanks to the energy label, 19 terawatt hours of electricity can be saved throughout Europe every year. That corresponds roughly to the output of four nuclear power plants. In addition, the regulation also contains measures for stronger market surveillance in the Member States. On the one hand, there will be a publicly accessible information page for consumers in the future. On this website, consumers can find information, compare devices with one another, or look up what the symbols on the energy label are actually actually mean. On the other hand, the regulation also facilitates market surveillance in the Member States. Today it is the case that national market surveillance authorities always have to request technical documents from manufacturers before they can receive them. In the future, all the documents they need to carry out their control tasks, which are so important, will be immediately available on a protected platform. For us Social Democrats, consumer protection was very important. During the negotiations, we also advocated that consumers should actually be compensated for buying electrical appliances with the wrong efficiency class. Unfortunately, however, the Member States have not shown themselves capable of compromising at all. I think that - as my colleague Tamburrano has just mentioned - is very, very unfortunate with regard to the emissions scandals.

We have now negotiated for a long time to reverse a mistake made ten years ago. Remember, under pressure from the Conservatives, here in this house ten years ago we pissed off the industry. At the time, the industry said that instead of having A, B, C - that is, simple energy classes that are easy to understand for the public - move on to A +, A ++, A +++. At the time, we as Greens warned that this would lead to a weakening of information for citizens. And we were right! We were now at a time when the last refrigerator that was still approved was in class A. In other words, the whole labeling regime no longer had any effect. We are improving that today, and that is also the good news. That means, dear citizens out there all over Europe: From now on clear signals again - buy A-devices from refrigerators, freezers and so on. And we have introduced a transparency platform. That means that we will also manage to carry out effective controls at the border of Europe if any junk goods try to get into Europe in order to actually protect the high-class products, which often come from Europe, from inferior quality comes from outside. The whole thing still has one weak point, and that is the question: How do we deal with oil and gas heating in the future? I can see that colleague Reul has just joined us. Herbert fought very successfully to ensure that oil and gas remain in the market forever. I think that if we take climate protection seriously, the moment must come at some point when people in new houses say: We can no longer afford to use fossil fuels in the heating sector.

The proposal for the system from \"A to G\", in combination with the proposal for reclassification of products on the scale based on stricter criteria, in our view will also contribute significantly to the promotion of innovation to increase energy efficiency. Equally important is the decision to create the new digital product database, to which consumers will have free access. This basis should provide as much information as possible about products, but also about consumer rights, in order to enhance transparency and finally put an end to the notoriety and misleading of consumers by large companies. Consumers have a right to have clearer indications of the energy efficiency of a product. Unfortunately, with the schedules set, the positive proposals included in the final agreement will not be promoted in the near future, but after 8-10 years. This is very disappointing and is an important reason to reconsider the agreement. Finally, I would like to emphasize that we demand immediate compensation for consumers who have been deceived into buying products with the wrong energy label. Although this proposal was not included in the final agreement, it needs to be promoted immediately.

We have on our table today a key file from the consumer perspective: the energy label is known and used by over 85% of consumers in Europe when they consider buying new household goods. Energy labelling brings concrete monetary and energy savings. As a result of different measures taken in the context of the European Union’s ecodesign and energy labelling policy, European households can save up to EUR 500 per year on their energy bills. Whilst these measures bring benefits at the level of individual households, they also do so at macroeconomic level by reducing Europe’s energy bill through energy savings and by contributing to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. In this way, they represent a direct contribution to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  Furthermore, our industries are encouraged to develop increasingly energy efficient products strengthening Europe’s competitiveness and our leading role in driving product energy performance standards at global level. Focusing on energy efficiency first – whether it is for buildings, products or in industry – is more important than ever in order to ensure security of supply and a successful energy transition while promoting investment, growth and jobs. The revision of the framework legislation on energy efficiency for products was one of the first legislative initiatives of the Juncker Commission in the field of energy, adopted already in July 2015.  The agreement reached on the Energy Labelling Regulation represents a good balance between the interests of different parties. Let me briefly highlight what I consider are the key aspects of our agreement.  A pragmatic approach prevailed regarding the use of delegated acts for laying down product-specific labelling requirements. We now have a clear process for re-scaling the existing labels and returning to the more effective A-to-G scale, providing far better information to the consumer. There will be a product registration database that will facilitate the work of national market surveillance authorities and will make it easier for consumers to compare the energy performance of many household appliances. Moreover, we have also succeeded in future-proofing the legislation by introducing provisions on software updates and smart appliances, and explicitly banning the use of defeat devices.  Finally, the label will be able to show information about, for example, durability or reparability, thereby further helping consumers to save money and at the same time contributing to the objectives of the circular economy. With regard to the issue of consumer refunds in the case of non-compliant labels, and in response to the Oral Question tabled by Ms Werner, Ms Rivasi, Mr Tamburrano and Mr Sylikiotis, the Commission fully supports the principle of providing for financial compensation to consumers in the event of wrongly labelled energy-related products.  The Commission made a statement to that effect at the last trilogue in March which will be attached to the Minutes of today’s vote. In this context, it has to be clear that the liability for a non-compliant label, and thus for providing compensation, lies with manufacturers – which are responsible for providing the correct label with their products – and not with retailers.  Therefore, horizontal consumer protection legislation may not provide the right legal framework, given that it generally does not address producers and covers the interaction of customers with their contractual partners. However, the Commission is currently developing legal proposals to strengthen enforcement of European Union harmonisation legislation for products. In this context, possible provisions on consumer compensation should the products they bought not comply with European Union harmonisation legislation, including energy labelling, are under close examination. The Commission aims to come forward with a final legal proposal on this before the end of the year. Now, let me conclude by saying that, in the Commission’s view, today’s agreement will strengthen and future-proof the iconic European energy label. With the newly agreed rules for labelling, this framework will continue to deliver towards our 2030 energy efficiency objectives. On the basis of all these elements, I am confident that the vote in plenary later today will give a strong backing to this important agreement that we have achieved together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Herbert REUL", "mepid": "28225", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen! It was a painstaking piece of work that we did there, and the project and what the Commission proposed changed quite a bit along the way - Mr Turmes has pointed this out - and I think that was good so that we have also corrected some places. We all want to save energy, and the way to do this by informing citizens that consumers can allow themselves to judge and then decide to buy the device that uses less energy is a very smart and correct way to go . The story has been a success story so far. It wasn't a question of yes or no either. The question was: What should the labeling look like? Do we have to bet on a new picture? Or can we continue to work in the previous picture? We then agreed to make a change, to make it easier, to make it more accessible, because the prevailing view was that the citizens understand this better than these ++ regulations. The second was that we also want to increase the effectiveness and that the citizens, but also the industry and retailers, can deal with it in the implementation, and therefore there have been different timelines. I think that is a wise decision - it is appropriate. We have tried to keep the effort for those who have to relabel and who have to adapt to new situations within a manageable framework. I think that's a pragmatic solution - it's usually a good thing to make such pragmatic suggestions. But in the long term, this will be the right path. When it comes to heating, dear Claude, it makes no sense at all to change this immediately after you've just done such a label. So it's nonsense in the matter, a decision Which device has which efficiency to hit today and to hit again tomorrow, the next day - so you can't handle it that way. The most critical point for me remains the database. I'm not entirely satisfied with that yet. It is a compromise, so I accept it. The point is that data is accessible to consumers, but that data is not accessible to business competitors. Therefore: data protection also applies there, and not only when it suits us, but also for companies that manufacture such products. They have a right to keep their industrial data secret. Thirdly, to this day I have not understood why the Commission needs this data - it does not need it at all!

We have a clearer system now, we do not have the pluses anymore. We have a common database so that we can really check the improvements; so that we know, for sure, that not all the appliances later on will only have ‘A’, meaning there is no real choice for the consumer.

These costs that are poured into the company and production today it is obvious that they will determine a further direction of travel and relocation of our companies.

Therefore, the agreement on the new energy labeling scheme is a good step in the right direction, and it is even one of the low-hanging fruit we have on our entire agenda. The next step is that in the revision of the Building Directive, we ensure that our homes and our workplaces follow suit in the effort for more energy efficiency, in order to have a more energy efficient Europe.

This is one area where a lot can be done in a very easy fashion. Firstly, I am becoming more and more convinced that consumers in general want to reduce their carbon emissions, and all they need is help to do so. This is one area where consumers will embrace what we are trying to do. Simplifying the labelling is absolutely crucial. How could anybody come up with a scheme of A, A+, A++? If you are going to buy an appliance and you see it marked ‘A’, well, you cannot get better than ‘A’ so it does not really make a whole lot of difference whether it is A+ or A++.  But there is a big difference, psychologically, between A and C, and A and G, and also the seven different colours will help consumers. This is the way the European Union needs to move in everything. Make it easier for consumers to understand what it is about and they will comply. One area I have a slight difficulty in understanding is the reference this morning to erroneous labelling. Erroneous labelling would not be possible if there were proper surveillance and proper penalties, because those who would engage in it would actually be put out of business. So I think that that is very important and I think the product database will help to ensure that that does not happen because it will mean proper compatibility of products, proper market surveillance, and will mean that suppliers will try and outbid one another to become more efficient and smarter in the appliances.

Proof of this is the 2014-2020 multiannual financial framework, in which 20% of the total budget of the Union is allocated to actions to combat climate change. It was alongside the 2015 summer package that the Commission proposed a labeling review, mainly because with the development of new technologies it was necessary to update the labeling legislation to make it understandable. Mr Eickhout said it: Can anyone tell what the difference is between an A ++ efficiency appliance or an A +++ efficiency appliance? This is what we are talking about. We must clarify the standard so that consumers can, according to their criteria, acquire the products that interest them the most and point out that, thanks to this clarification in the labeling, together with the development of the eco-design package, we can achieve a saving of 500 euros in every European household. And not only that: we can also make our industry more competitive, bringing it a profit of 65 billion euros, according to data from the Commission itself, and savings in energy consumption equivalent to the annual figure for Italy and all the Baltic countries combined. We therefore managed to return to a clarification of the labeling - from \"A\" to \"G\", from dark green to deep red - we also introduced a product registration database to ensure that the competent authorities can exercise their supervisory role and we empower citizens, through a public database containing all energy labels, so that they can compare the differences in efficiency between household equipment.

This Regulation also contributes to the moderation of energy demand and the achievement of the Union’s energy efficiency targets, so there are macroeconomic savings and advantages with this solution. It establishes deadlines to replace the current A++ classes with an A to G scale. It also sets out a procedure for rescaling labels based on technological development, thus also providing incentives for innovation and pushing less efficient products out of the market. This will make energy labels more understandable for consumers and help them make better informed purchasing choices. The proposal also contains clearer rules on promotional campaigns and national incentives to promote higher classes of efficiency, and aims to improve enforcement mechanisms and transparency for customers by creating a platform with a database of products covered by energy labelling requirements.

Allow me to make three remarks. The first is to say that we have the same labelling requirements for imports. It is not only local manufacturers; imports have to be labelled in the same way as products manufactured in the European Union. Many of you expressed concerns about the data, but the best way to ensure data protection is for the Commission to manage the database and also, with the data, we will be able to adjust the labels more efficiently. On heaters, I saw different positions in the House, but I will say that the Commission proposal did not contain a definite requirement to re-scale. We think that it is an improvement that the agreed version contains a timetable and a final date by which the A and B label will only be available for heat pumps, renewables and CHP. We also think that the timetable makes sense and is reasonable because it will provide time and incentives to bring down the cost of these heaters to the benefit of our industry and our consumers.  Finally, I will recall that the energy union is one of the ten priorities of the Juncker Commission and that ‘energy efficiency first’ is one of its leading principles. In this respect, reaching an agreement on one of the key proposals for delivering real energy and monetary savings to European consumers and business is an important step towards the realisation of any union which aims to provide European Union consumers with secure, sustainable, competitive and affordable energy.  This shows that, when there is political commitment and shared objectives, we are able to offer a concrete response to the needs of business and European citizens.

There are actually some things that could be done better and label rescaling, particularly for boilers and boilers, is another gripe. It could have been anticipated, but I trust in the Clean Energy Package and we will fight to create an environment at European level so that gas boilers are somehow progressively put out of the market, especially in the new regulations regarding energy efficiency in buildings and active and intelligent buildings.

It deals with almost two-thirds of all greenhouse gases emitted across the EU. This law will translate the Paris Agreement into concrete action by the Member States.  However, last week President Trump announced that he would withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change agreement. Even though we know that many US states, cities and businesses are continuing or even scaling-up climate action and green investment. This is sending a dreadful signal to the rest of the world. But, thankfully, China has restated their strong commitment to the Paris Agreement and President Macron has announced that France will do more compared to earlier commitments. So, with or without Trump, climate action and green investment under the Paris Agreement must move ahead.  I applaud that the groups here in the European Parliament have decided to unanimously give a strong signal to the international community that it will support this report in plenary tomorrow. I am also grateful for the strong support the report received in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) and for the further work done ahead of the plenary to build an even stronger compromise.  As a result of this work, ALDE, the EPP and ECR groups agreed to table a set of joint amendments that will do three things: firstly, maintain the strength and emissions trajectory adopted by the ENVI Committee. The trajectory will secure the delivery of our 2030 target under the Paris Agreement.  Secondly, it will increase the optional use of forest credits from 119 million to 280 million tons, which will help build the business case for forest-based climate measures. In the long term, our forests are crucial to build the zero-carbon economy. At the same time, we must maintain a strong driver for energy efficient and clean transport.  Thirdly, we will give better support to lower—income Member States that have reduced their emissions significantly in earlier years. There are 17 Member States that will benefit from these measures. Farming is also covered in this regulation, and we will include special support for climate—efficient farmers. We must recognise the specific situation of the farming sector and ensure that they can continue to produce but protect at the same time.  The compromises reached will represent a balance between delivering on the EU’s commitments on the one hand, and providing fairness for all Member States and regulating the regulated sectors on the other. Because of the politically balanced agreement reached and the strong signal the climate action regulation will give to the international community, I urge you all therefore to back the report in full, which includes the compromise package negotiated ahead of the plenary vote.

This is an important initiative to accelerate the low-carbon transition of key sectors of the economy in Europe, representing around 60% of European Union total emissions. The latest greenhouse gas emissions statistics, which the European Environment Agency released only two weeks ago, clearly point to the challenges. Emissions, in this sector, outside emissions trading, are increasing again, notably in the transport sector.  This debate, and the vote tomorrow, show that the European Union is serious about international climate commitment under the Paris Agreement and that it wants to progress without delay with domestic implementation. At the same time, Parliament is also making swift progress on one of the key legislative priorities of the European Union, and in the joint declaration on the European Union’s legislative priorities for 2017 the three institutions have agreed that the 2030 climate action proposals shall be given priority treatment in 2017.  I very much appreciate the hard work of your rapporteur, Mr Gerbrandy. He would have been happy to be here today but unfortunately he cannot be with us. On this proposal, I want to thank him for the excellent cooperation and I also want to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their efforts in ensuring that Parliament’s report could be presented to the plenary before the summer. Many of the key elements of what you are proposing for the vote in this House tomorrow are in line with the Commission proposals, notably on the national targets and connection between sectors with the use of the flexibilities. This is encouraging for us. As in the Commission proposals, this maintains a careful balance of three central objectives: fairness, cost-efficiency and environmental integrity.  I also note your efforts to better reward early action, which is also a central issue in the discussions in the Council. The LULUCF flexibility proposed by the Commission is of high importance and its extent should be sufficient enough to recognise the lower mitigation potential of agriculture and incentivise actions promoting carbon sequestration in agricultural soils and afforestation. Let me offer a few comments on two key aspects of the rapporteur’s final proposals. Firstly, the report adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) includes a requirement for Member States to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in effort-sharing sectors by 80% by 2050 compared to 2005. It is true that consistent and long-term emission reductions are a cornerstone of European Union climate policy. However, I think it is too early to set national targets and emission trajectories for 2050 now already, without any thorough impact assessments and even before the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has provided its special report.  We must also consider the balance with the ETS and with a policy related to land use, land-use change and forestry. We should not set in stone now partial long-term legislation only covering 60% of total European Union emissions. The Commission will address the long-term issues in the context of developing the European Union mid-century strategy, which, in accordance with the G7 Commission, is to be delivered well ahead of the 2020 deadline. Secondly, I note the proposal for a biennial compliance check instead of every five years. This would significantly increase the misery burden of implementation and would not constitute a good example of better regulation.  The Commission fully supports the efforts of Parliament and the Council to agree on the ETS and non-ETS proposal this year. On the ETS file, we are in trilogue negotiations and I welcome the renewed efforts to make progress there. I look forward to continuing to work with you on the effort-sharing proposal and bringing it to a successful conclusion with your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 4, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 38, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Merja KYLLÖNEN", "mepid": "124736", "text": "Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Transport and Tourism. - (FI) Mr President, Commission, ladies and gentlemen, thank you all very much for your very constructive and constructive cooperation.

However, some changes are needed to better promote the long-term predictability, ensure consistency with other policies, in particular the energy efficiency target, as well as ensure sufficient flexibility and solidarity between Member States. Effort sharing can in fact be an important driver to favor the decarbonisation of the economy and to fulfill the Paris agreement. The agricultural sector is responsible for 10% of greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union and must therefore necessarily play its part. Agriculture is the sector that will suffer the most from the impacts of climate change, but at the same time there are also agricultural practices that can lead to a reduction in emissions and offer additional environmental benefits and additional income for farmers. Flexibility in the LULUCF sectors, in particular the significant mitigation and uptake potential from forests, is key to reducing compliance costs and to ensure additional support for agriculture that must contribute to climate action.

The country targets have been negotiated by the Commission and the Council, and Parliament has respected them and has not wanted to touch them. Our debate has been and has focused - which has not been easy at all, by the way - fundamentally on the date of the beginning of the trajectory and on the flexibilities. The agreements embodied in the compromise amendments that we will vote on tomorrow are acceptable. They are manageable and they are balanced. What my political group likes the least is the start of the trajectory in 2018, but it is a negotiation and we have all had to give in. We are, however, reasonably satisfied with a LULUCF flexibility of 280 million tons of carbon. We would have liked it to have been a floor and not a ceiling, as we have agreed in the end, but it is what we have agreed. An early fulfillment reserve of 90 million tons is very satisfactory, because it can alleviate the effort of some countries that have been less favored in sharing the effort.

Unfortunately, for a long time, we had people who considered climate change to be a fictitious thing – this is happening today as well: if you pretend that it is not real, it will literally disappear. We know today that climate change is affecting every country in every continent. What we face today is a difficult task but an achievable one. The task before us goes beyond the choices that individuals privately make. This is about industries and it is about governments making the right choices and taking concrete measures. This is our moment for action. We had the opportunity to make serious policies with the emissions trading scheme and this is our opportunity now with this regulation. We need to end once and for all the free ride that polluters have been given. This is not a technical debate but I believe that this is a human rights debate because our citizens and our children have a right to a cleaner world. As Socialists and Democrats, we believe that it is our duty to respond properly to our planet’s greatest challenge with determination and honesty. I am proud that this political group was part of a group that stopped the attempts to water down this legislation. This is what we worked hard to achieve in the effort sharing regulation. There are no excuses: our economy will die if our ecosystems collapse. The climate action legislation sets a clear trajectory to 2030, and a longer-term objective up to 2050, to reduce emissions in important sectors including transport, agriculture, buildings and waste. I would say to the Commissioner that we need to think now if we want to ensure our future and we need to have a long-term perspective. This Parliament must have a progressive and ambitious stand on these measures, closing loopholes and making sure that Member States reduce their emissions; ensuring also that all sectors contribute to a proper reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.  We pushed for more compliance checks, yes; every two years. Unlike the Commissioner, we know that this can be done and we want to be ambitious and we want to have something that really works. We aligned the review cycle with the global stocktake of the implementation of the Paris Agreement as well. We believe that we have the means to stop this devastation but we need to have the political will to do so. This is our opportunity to really show that we are ready to stand up to the occasion.

It is a pity, however, that my proposal to increase the flexibility mechanism to 425 million tonnes, so that we promote the development of forests and proper forest management practices, which is in line with the spirit of the Paris Agreement, has not been understood. Good action in the forestry sector offset emissions significantly. Moreover, I find it unfair to allocate units to promote richer countries. Setting a benchmark for 2016-2018 is detrimental to poorer countries. In order to maintain policy continuity, it is necessary to set an emission level starting at the end of the current trading period.

We have a lot of political imbalances, we have a lot of environmental imbalances and we have a lot of economic imbalances, and they all act together. Sometimes in a happy way, usually in a less than happy way. The question about these three files – effort-sharing, emissions trading, and land use, land-use change and forestry – is in the same way a triangle and a very difficult one. It could turn out to be a Bermuda Triangle in which money, hope and environment are those things, or it could show itself to be a functional but very precarious triangle where all the three parts are deeply interconnected. If we are not able to keep up the emissions trading part of it, then things will fall down under effort-sharing and ultimately in the sinks in the forests. So, we need to have a very strong political approach to the problems we are seeing here.  If we do not manage this, if we give in to bad information, bad tweets from the Tweet House – formerly it was called the White House but it has got a new name: the Tweet House – if you do not do this properly, we are doomed. Therefore, the question of how we manage effort-sharing is of utmost importance and I think that Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy has done a terrific job to be able to put the pieces together and be slightly ahead of the curve, because we know that the closer we come to 2040-2050, the harder it will be.

However, we are here today and on the agenda of the plenary session we have the second flagship document for combating climate and greenhouse gas emissions in the EU, which also involves previously much pointlessly neglected sectors such as transport, buildings and, above all, agriculture. In recent years, we have only heard from these sectors how nothing is going on. The Effort Sharing Regulation is the link between the EU ETS and LULUCF documents and other policies. Today, more than ever, in the light of the backward and utterly meaningless steps taken by the current US administration, it is important that we approve this regulation in an ambitious and strong version, passed by the ENVI Committee, before the Environment Council itself. We need to demonstrate our continued commitment to combating climate change. The negotiations have been difficult and I cannot say that I am completely satisfied with everything that has gone through. I am not particularly satisfied with the next newly established allowance reserve or with other interventions in the not yet functioning MSR. However, I believe that we have managed to adopt a sufficiently ambitious document. I am pleased, for example, that we have succeeded in adopting an amendment involving the remaining maritime transport, which we do not address in the ETS amendment.

I very much regret this because he really put a lot of effort into this file and it is a pity that he cannot be here. Our thoughts are certainly with him. Secondly, I would like to say that it is a bit strange that tomorrow we are going to discuss Trump withdrawing from the Paris Agreement and today we are going to discuss our own actions. I can tell you that the Greens tried to link those two discussions. A strange idea, is it not: that we link criticism of Trump together with what we ourselves are doing within the EU?  But the big parties, especially the Christian Democrats, did not want to link them and we know why: because it is much easier to criticise Trump, for free, while at the same time knowing that in our own actions we are not doing enough to implement the Paris Agreement at all. But of course we are happy to have that debate on another day.  That is really my main criticism, too, in this Parliament. When you criticise Trump tomorrow, remind yourselves at the same time of what we are doing ourselves. First of all – and we really know all this – the current target on the table that the EU is willing to take of minus 40% by 2030 is not enough for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Stop saying that the EU is implementing the Paris Agreement. We are not on track. Secondly, if you look at the two pieces of legislation on the table, we are watering it down. We are creating loopholes – loopholes in the legislation – so that this minus 40% is not even really minus 40%. That is not at all good. The Commission’s proposal had too many loopholes. We improved the Commission’s proposal. Unfortunately there are a couple of amendments on the table again – in order to get the Christian Democrats on board – to go back to the size of the Commission’s loophole, so we are going backwards again, watering the proposal down again, but okay, that is what the Christian Democrats wanted and I hope that they will acknowledge this tomorrow when they criticise Trump.  But it is an improvement compared to the Commission’s proposal and the big fight will be with the Member States, because they are also criticising Trump but at the same time watering down the proposal even further. So please, ladies and gentlemen, let us vote for this and then we will have our proposal on the table.

However, in this instance, the project is one of the biggest threats to European industry and competitiveness. Once again, we are expanding and strengthening its remit. This time the European Commission proposal, Climate Action Regulation implementing the Paris Agreement, covers all sectors that currently fall outside the EU emission trading system, with particular regard to transport, waste, environment and agriculture. The aim of this proposal is to deliver, in the relevant sectors, 30% emissions reductions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement sets out the goal to keep global temperature increases well below 2 °C and to strive for no more than 1.5 °C temperature increase. Consistent with these goals, the Paris Agreement also requires that zero net emissions must be achieved in the second half of this century. In addition, in 2009, the EU adopted its objective of 80—95% greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2050.  The EU’s climate and energy policies keep perpetuating the same misguided path, continuing to be the solo leader in the futile battle against climate change, whereas the USA and others are acting in favour of progress and prosperity. The sole effect that this huge burden of climate regulation is going to have is to exacerbate the crisis already being experienced by European Union industries that are forced to move offshore, taking their emissions and their jobs with them.

It is now up to the Member States to come up with a model in which farmers and horticulturists are actually rewarded for capturing greenhouse gases. This can be done, for example, with a CO2 trading system or by giving more business space. In addition, Dutch agriculture and horticulture are already at the forefront of innovations that lead to increasingly lower emissions of greenhouse gases per kilogram of food. Unfortunately, European legislation blocks innovations to turn the surplus of animal manure into fertilizer substitutes. According to calculations, this allows us to reduce the consumption of fertilizer by 15%, and thus also the emission of greenhouse gas.

I know, Commissioner, that you are fully familiar with our problems in Ireland, because we have a strong and large agricultural sector. We are doing a lot of work on climate—smart agriculture, but there is only so far we can go.  I am all for ambition, and, Mr Eickhout, I hope you appreciate that. However, ambition with targets that are unachievable can be distracting, and our 2020 target was unachievable. We know that we have to do more, but what I would ask colleagues to understand is the situation where we do not have heavy industry, we have a large agricultural sector and we need much more flexibility on this issue, because farmers are concerned that the cost of this at the moment – if we look at the calculations – would be over EUR 1.7 billion in terms of purchasing carbon.  I do not want an opt-out here, because we all have duties and responsibilities, but I want an understanding that we are major producers of food – we export it to Europe and beyond – and we need an acknowledgment of that fact in the work, and I hope that in the negotiations it will be acknowledged.

After the Paris Agreement we try to put it into practice with the relevant regulation. Of course, Trump, with a certainly myopic vision, gave a different line, but there is no denying that American states, big cities and large companies tend to say every day, more and more, that instead on the line of Paris Agreement must continue to operate. Europe must be a leader in this, it must be a leader internationally and globally. The proposal that has been put on the table is an interesting proposal. Parliament has certainly improved it and corrected some errors that there were, Commissioner, because the early movers, i.e. the countries that had already made a great effort and had already moved forward, had difficulties in implementing the proposal and you recognized, from the very first presentation, that there was something to correct. Parliament has today implemented the corrective measures. With the reserve of 90 million tonnes proposed by my colleague Gerbrandy, I believe that we are heading in the right direction. Italy will be able to implement this proposal, which at the beginning was certainly very adverse to our country. On the other hand, Parliament's ambition, that we as EPP have agreed to anticipate the downward curve in the application of the agreements, is in the right direction.

These sectors account for almost 60% of total emissions in the EU in 2014 and the definition of national targets was made through an equity process.

I am encouraged by the Members’ engagement with the issues, and I appreciate the commitment to maintain the European Union’s role as a path-breaker in the area of international climate action.  On the two non-ETS proposals, the discussions have progressed well in the Council, the technical work is nearly finalised, and I would like to thank the Members for taking this important step in Parliament, which provides crucial political momentum for this proposal. I am convinced that the Council, under the leadership of the incoming Estonian presidency, will be able to move forward swiftly before the next climate conference in Bonn in November. The European Union, as a driving force behind the high-ambition coalition, cannot come to Bonn empty handed.  I would like to give answers on some other points raised, because it was hinted by someone that the European Union was not implementing the Paris Agreement. We should be clear on two things. The first is that we really are implementing the Paris Agreement. Out of the 140 nationally determined contributions, the European Union has the most ambitious one, namely a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 40%. This is the biggest, most ambitious target. But we have something that makes us different from the rest – in fact, two things. We have launched all the legislation needed to achieve our targets, and I can assure Mr Eickhout that, in all the legislation the Commission is launching, nothing is being watered down, and incidentally that goes for the decarbonisation study too. We will get there –taking into account also that Paris is not an agreement which stops in 2030, it is a dynamic agreement with a five-year ambition cycle, and I am sure we will work in such a way in the coming years that we will bring on board our international partners, including even the USA. This is one president, but there will come other presidents and other administrations, and we also have to understand that we have seen a movement in the USA in response to Mr Trump’s withdrawal: a massive one from states, big cities and major businesses who have announced that they will do their part to help fulfil the original US commitment of reducing emissions by between 26% and 28% in 2025 as against 2005. So, we are implementing the Paris Agreement. We are serious in the legislation we are introducing, and what we are discussing today is of the utmost importance. Establishing binding targets for Member States was not easy in the discussions with them. Establishing such targets in agriculture, in transport and in the building sector will be a difficult exercise, and this Parliament has improved our proposals. With regard to the agricultural sector, as many of you – Mr Lynch, Mr Caputo, Mr Flanagan, Ms McGuinness and others – have pointed out, agriculture and forestry are part of the solution, and not of the problem. In the discussions, we will have to look further at future reform of the common agricultural policy, to see how we will ensure it contributes to the solution and to maintaining a dynamic and prosperous European agricultural sector. So, my message today is one of optimism because I have just come from Bologna and, with the Environment Ministers of Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom, the European Commissioners are reaffirming their strong commitment to the swift and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, which remains the global instrument for activity in tackling climate change and adapting to its effects. We are committed to its implementation, our partners are committed to its implementation, the European Parliament is supporting the Commission in having the most ambitious legislation possible. I would like to thank all of you who took part in this debate, and particularly to thank Mr Gerbrandy, whom I am missing today, for the work he has done and for the good work I am pretty sure we will do in the trilogues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 75, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Catherine BEARDER", "mepid": "96955", "text": "  deputising for the rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to thank all the speakers for their good wishes to my good friend and colleague, Gerben—Jan Gerbrandy, who is the rapporteur on this report, and who despite doing all the heavy work on this is unable to be with us today because he has a family crisis. I am sure I speak for all this House in wishing Gerben—Jan and his family all the best.  I would like to thank the Commission for its commitment to driving down CO2 emissions. I heard earlier that there are concerns about how we can get to 2050. Well, nobody has ever said that tackling climate change is going to be easy, but it has to be done. Even the Paris Agreement still only brings us back to a level where we know we were emitting too much. The damage continues to be done to the whole planet. Every tonne of CO2 that is emitted today will remain in the atmosphere for over a hundred years.  But there is good news. We can have a green economy. We can drive the innovation and business that can address that. It is tough for farmers to change their farming practices. We understand that. We have been as firm as we can but as amenable as possible to their difficulties in making sure that farmers can associate themselves with this message and this regulation. We have heard from the deniers from – I am ashamed to say – the UK. They deny climate change, they even deny their existence as an effective political party in the UK, and have nearly been wiped out. I think everybody here agrees that climate change is a real issue and one on which action must be effected. A strong vote from this Parliament tomorrow will send a message to businesses, to farmers, to industry, to consumers, and to voters and the young people of Europe that we are serious about climate change. It is a compromise, sure, but it is one that we have to make and the political groups here are committed to it.

In 2009, the EU adopted its target of reducing these emissions by 80-95% by 2050. The effort sharing regulation or \"climate action in implementation of the Paris Agreement\" in question today covers 60% of emissions EU greenhouse gas emissions and covers sectors outside the emissions trading scheme, including transport, waste, construction and agriculture. The overall target at European level for reducing carbon emissions by 40% by 2030 becomes mandatory for these sectors at national level. I support the establishment of a trajectory to achieve emissions reductions of at least 80% by 2050, in order to ensure the long-term predictability of policies and the necessary investments.

Since its inception in 1987, more than 9 million people have studied, worked or volunteered abroad under the programme. Erasmus has thus proved to be a key tool for international mobility and intercultural exchange. It gives real meaning to the idea of European citizenship. Thirty years means that we can already celebrate three generations of Erasmus students. I am very pleased to note that, amongst decision makers, including within the EU institutions, many colleagues have their own personal experience of having participated in the Erasmus exchange.  We are now midway through the current programme, Erasmus Plus. Our focus now needs to be turned towards the next programming period and we should already start reflecting on the ways in which we can further improve and develop the programme beyond 2020.

Three minutes is short. So I will have only one message for the future, while we are going to celebrate the 9 millionth young Erasmus: let's be together at least 9 times more ambitious, because Erasmus is a good answer to the stupidity of national egoisms and withdrawal on oneself. Erasmus is a Europe with great promise, a confident, united Europe, resolutely turned towards the future. I am therefore counting on you to ensure that the European budget matches the talent of our young people. (Applause) Several members of the Commission participated in the Erasmus program. My neighbor Tibor Navracsics, when he was a young student in Hungary, could not participate in the program, but today he is the responsible commissioner.

Happy coincidence this between the recent 30 years of Portugal in the European Union and the 30 years of Erasmus in Portugal and in Europe. Coincidence between one of the happiest chapters in Portuguese recent history and one of the happiest programs of European identity. I am only a humble example of this happy coincidence. Middle class, from a small rural village in the north of Portugal, I left home very early to move to the city, to the big city, to study in secondary school. I later moved to one of the oldest Portuguese universities and then I had the opportunity to head to Europe. With a backpack on my back, full, certainly, of uncertainty, I felt that I conquered Madrid as if it were my small village. It was 10 eternal and wonderful months where I became an apprentice scientist and where I became, already there, a full European. But, before heading to Europe, I had already felt Europe in a very special way, with all the Erasmus students who visited my university and stayed there for a semester or an entire year. It was these “Erasmus” that preceded me that first taught me what it was like to be truly European. I wanted to tell you, I wanted to tell you, Europe, that you are right when you have the ambition to make Erasmus a lifelong partner for all your citizens. You will certainly have Europe, a more extended existence because you will certainly be more Europe, because we, those who have had the experience and all Europeans, will be more citizens. The speaker is an active ambassador for the Erasmus and Europe program. Regarding the months I spent there, I will say little, because we all know that what happens in Erasmus stays in Erasmus.

I have learned a lot that I can still benefit from today, be it the independence to find my way in a foreign country despite major linguistic, but also despite minor cultural differences. I have put aside my fears of communicating in a foreign language, because at some point I learned that it is not so important to speak flawlessly, but that communication is effortless even with small mistakes. I also learned a lot of cultural things about the country and about everyday working life in Spain. As an example, I think of my first day at the company, where when I arrived I would have expected a small welcoming committee, just as I am used to from my German homeland. But nobody was really prepared for it, which was not a problem at all. The right people were brought together in a very short time, and shortly afterwards I was on a company tour, which also involved minor linguistic complications. But you worked a lot with hands and feet and drawings, so it wasn't a problem. In summary, it can be said that the internship was a huge success for me. I got to know great people, also saw beautiful places, I found an excellent organization from Erasmus + and I learned many lessons for my future life.

Although the current state of stateless persons can be attributed to inefficient administration, serious problems arise where a group of people is marginalized for political purposes. Systematic discrimination against minorities, such as Myanmar, is a serious violation of human rights and the Union must do everything possible to improve the situation of vulnerable groups in the region, including the recognition of these persons as nationals of their home country.

The Five Presidents’ reports and the Rome Declaration underline that the Union should promote convergence and that we need to work towards completing the economic and monetary union. I would like to thank Parliament for its valuable input in several own initiative reports, namely Brok, Bresso, Verhofstadt and Berès.  The euro is one of Europe’s most significant achievements. It is the currency of 340 million people in 19 countries and the second most used currency in the world. It has brought price stability and has made it easier to do business and to travel. The euro quickly became the symbol of prosperity for our citizens and it should remain so. The financial and economic crisis underlines the weaknesses in the way the euro is set up. The determined policy response has made EMU stronger but not filled all the gaps. There is still a lack of convergence and questions remain about the long—term resilience of the euro area.  We cannot wait for another crisis to act. The reflection paper presents a toolbox on the way forward. It is more targeted at what can be done over the next two years to 2019 and more open about what might come afterwards up to 2025. Key guiding principles for any advances are: a balanced approach in which responsibility and solidarity, risk reduction and risk sharing go hand in hand; the openness of the euro deepening process for all EU countries; and keeping the unity of the single market, transparency and democratic accountability. Our ideas on the way forward are structured in three building blocks: financial union, economic and fiscal union, and governance and accountability. On financial union, we are aiming at renewed financial integration, safer financial institutions that can finance the real economy and more risk sharing via private channels. The capital markets union is key to broadening financial options, so I am glad of the recent agreements reached by the co—legislators on venture capital and securitisation and look forward to working with you on the initiatives on the mid—term review. We should further reduce risks in our banking sector based on the package of November 2016. We are also working on Member States with a European strategy to reduce the stocks of non-performing loans. The EU framework for bank resolution will not be fully effective without a fiscal backstop to the single resolution fund, and without a European deposit insurance scheme depositors will not be protected to the same extent across the euro area. We need to further weaken the link between banks and sovereigns. In this context we are following the ongoing work in the European Systemic Risk Board on so-called sovereign bond backed securities. They can deliver tangible benefits by increasing the diversification of banks’ balance sheets and by fostering private risk sharing. They do not involve debt neutralisation among Member States or changes in the regulatory treatment of government bonds. For the longer term, we need a debate about the zero risk rates of certain banks under current banking rules and a possible new European safe asset. So there are both complex and sensitive issues. Our reflection paper frames them with strong caveats, notably in terms of preventing unwarranted consequences for financial stability and for moral hazard.  In the area of economic and fiscal union, the aim is to see convergence between Member States towards more resilient economic structures. With the bulk of economic and social policies under national responsibilities, there is no doubt that we need to have a continued commitment to structural reforms. The European Semester will continue to be the main platform for policy coordination and we will continue to seek improvements. The capacity of macroeconomic stabilisation in the euro area could also be reinforced. We are presenting three options for such functions to assist countries hit by economic shocks too large to cope with on their own.  One option is the European investment protection scheme. In times of strain, public investment is the first item to be cut from the national budget and this can harm future growth. The investment protection scheme could take the form of a financial instrument and I believe could be set within the existing legal framework. Other options include the European unemployment reinsurance scheme and a rainy day fund. In any case, it should not lead to permanent transfers among countries nor undermine incentives for sound fiscal policy—making at national level. Finally, we need greater democratic accountability and higher transparency, integrating intergovernmental agreements into EU law and ensuring proper democratic oversight. Pierre Moscovici will be elaborating on this in more detail. I would like to underline that the White Paper and reflection paper process is not an intellectual exercise for the Commission. We hope to reach a constructive debate across Europe in the coming months and to see a broad agreement emerging on the way forward.

It was clear from the start of this reflection process that when it came to our Economic and Monetary Union, there was no question of whether we really needed to move forward. There could not, this time, be a question of having several scenarios, one of which would have been the status quo, because we are convinced in the Commission, and I am delighted, that it progress must be made to complete Economic and Monetary Union. Why? For three reasons: first, because we have an economic recovery in the euro zone which is there, but which remains too fragile and too uneven. We must relaunch it and promote convergence. Secondly, because there is a real risk which is that of a two-speed euro zone. These consequences would be serious because, yes, it is true that populism has lost a few political battles in Europe - I rejoice as a European, as a Commissioner and as a Frenchman - but it did not lose the war. It still feeds on economic dissatisfaction and inequality. Finally, because it seems to me that there is a political \"window of opportunity\" that is opening up in Europe. There is now a pro-European wind blowing and now is the time, I believe, to seize it. I want to stress that what we are proposing today is necessary and desirable for Member States. When I say 'for the Member States', I mean all the current Member States and I also mean the possible future membership of others. It's not about forcing anyone to join, of course, but it is true that after Brexit, the only country with a formal opt-out clause will be Denmark. All the others are intended to join the euro once the conditions are met. Our aim is not to make this accession process binding, it is to make it attractive, to make everyone want to join the euro. What are our concrete ideas? Valdis Dombrovkis has already told you about financial union. This is the aspect on which we must articulate the principles of solidarity and responsibility most precisely. There are several concrete proposals on the table which should make it possible to combine risk reduction and sharing, especially for non-performing loans. There are also other sites where work is less advanced, but which are no less important. This is the case, for example, with the idea of ​​setting up a new risk-free asset for the euro zone, which could take several forms, but which should not be confused with what were called “euro- obligations\". What I would like to emphasize above all is the creation of a true economic and budgetary union, which we must pursue if we want a sustainable and upward convergence of our economies. What does this imply? First, in the short term, we will explore the possibilities to strengthen the \"euro area\" dimension of the European Semester and create convergence criteria with financial incentives to achieve them. There are also other possible ways to strengthen the existing capacities in the European budget to help stabilize our economies. But we are convinced that in the medium term we will have to be more ambitious in creating a macroeconomic stabilization function for the euro area. In our view, an instrument of this type would have many advantages: it would support the action of national fiscal stabilizers in the event of a crisis and it would allow better aggregate fiscal policy at the level of the euro area as a whole, in particular when monetary policy reaches its limits. We know that this instrument should not be a permanent transfer mechanism, that it should not encourage moral hazard, but we believe that it should be put in place. Of course, we have to debate its form, use, financing and possible links with the European budget or with a reformed European Stability Mechanism. Then again, I said, there aren't multiple scenarios, but there are very clearly multiple options on our ambitious scheme. We also need to discuss the precise form it can take. It could be a system for protecting public investments in the event of a recession, a European unemployment reinsurance scheme or even a rainy day fund - a reserve fund for hard times. The most ambitious interpretation of this idea would be that of a real euro zone budget. This has been debated several times in your assembly. Each idea has its own merits. The only one we rule out - if I may say so - is that of doing nothing. So let's start the debate. Finally, and this is not the least important thing, today we want to launch a deep debate on strengthening the governance of the euro area and on its democratic capacity. We believe that a strengthened Economic and Monetary Union depends on our Member States agreeing to share more responsibilities, to take more decisions together on matters of common interest with a legal framework that is also common. We must therefore go further in the political integration of the euro area. We must proceed gradually, then, in parallel, perhaps launch new projects. A first step could be - should be, in our opinion - the formalization, by the end of next year, of the already very regular dialogue between the Commission and the European Parliament on economic policy. We have arrangements. I think they could be extended to other institutions, starting with the Eurogroup whose members, of course - the finance ministers - will remain primarily accountable to their national parliaments. This could lead to an arrangement on the democratic accountability of the euro area, signed by all the players, with a view to the election of the next European Parliament, in June 2019. Then, in the longer term, I think such agreement, if it were to see the light of day, could be incorporated into European treaties. It should be added that the integration of the \"fiscal pact\" into European law was already decided by the participating Member States when they signed the treaty. It should therefore be implemented quickly. Another path could also be explored, which would be the integration of the European Stability Mechanism into the European scheme. This would of course be linked to the development of this European stability mechanism: some people speak of a European Monetary Fund. What, it seems to me, is decisive in ensuring that our decisions are taken more in the direction of the general interest, is democracy. This is the reason why, in my opinion and in our opinion, a new balance must be created between the Commission and the Eurogroup with - it is possible - the merger of the roles of commissioner in charge of the euro and President of the Eurogroup. We can and must also move forward. We have already made proposals in this regard for a unified external representation of the euro area. This takes up what we already said during phase 1 of the EMU debate. We can go even further with the creation of a Eurozone Treasury, which could take over the tasks of budgetary surveillance, coordination and management of the stabilization function that I mentioned earlier. This Treasury could in a way bring together existing responsibilities and services, including the European stability, once it becomes an integral part of the institutional framework of the euro area. This Treasury could ultimately be placed under the responsibility of a euro area finance minister. It is not, moreover, a question of focusing on the nomination or the name - Mrs Mogherini, who chairs the RELEX working group and who is vice-president of the Commission, is not the Minister for Foreign Affairs of the 'Union -, it is not a question of supervising the ministers, but it could be a question of a personality who, precisely, could exercise these functions of president of the ad hoc council, of the Eurogroup and of commissioner at the same time . Finally, the idea of ​​a European Monetary Fund, which would naturally be built from the European Stability Mechanism, deserves more debate. Here are quickly gathered the ideas that we can find. They have different degrees of ambition and precision. There are a lot of options, but we wanted to build a package that is balanced. The euro is already seen as a symbol and as a guarantee of stability by Europeans. Our ambition is to make it, beyond that, a vehicle for prosperity. As Jacques Delors said, \"the euro protects but does not boost\". We must complete it in this direction and we believe that it is only by reducing economic and social differences in the euro zone that we can sustainably beat populism, which is always dangerous in our countries. Basically, our ambition and our intention is to say that it is now time to complete this course that we started to build at the time of the Maastricht Treaty to move towards a real and complete Economic and Monetary Union with real institutions and with a dimension that is missing: when we are in the Eurogroup, our fellow citizens are shocked and frustrated at not knowing what is going on there, within four walls. We sometimes decide the fate of peoples without anyone, starting with you, ladies and gentlemen, is informed.We need democracy, because there is no political union without democracy.I believe that we have provided serious work here, which is subject to your debate, and it is this debate that we are of course quite prepared to conduct with you and, even more than that, eager to do so..", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 137, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Françoise GROSSETÊTE", "mepid": "2025", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, Commissioner, is Europe sick of its currency? We are at his bedside today. The euro - you said it - has been a great success. The euro has protected us, certainly, but today our currency area is torn by too large macroeconomic divergences, and these divergences increase inequalities and fuel Euroscepticism. The euro is therefore at a crossroads. I congratulate the Commission, because its proposals are ambitious and constitute a useful basis for reflection to strengthen Economic and Monetary Union. The euro is no longer a taboo: everything must be put on the table. There are three keys to our success: trust, responsibility and solidarity. Trust, first of all, is a prerequisite; however, this confidence has been weakened by promises too often aborted. Many states are on the path to reforms, I hope that it will be the same for France, but everyone's efforts are essential to restore confidence and thus complete the banking union, in particular with a European deposit guarantee - you mentioned it - which is still sorely lacking. The corollary of this trust is responsibility. Responsible management of public finances, according to the rules, for example, of a convergence code, would pave the way for the creation of a common fiscal capacity and a strengthening of the governance of the euro area. Solidarity, finally: if we want to share the same currency, we must set up solidarity mechanisms. It is not, of course, to create a transfer union, but to be able to stick together when the going gets tough. To this end, I plead for the establishment of a European monetary fund.

We need more investment, we need greater coordination of our economic policy, we need responsible institutions, and we need a process in which the modernization of our economy and the modernization of our societies are advanced - economic modernization, ecological modernization and social modernization.

The reflection paper says: The euro is more than a currency. Yes that's right. But it is also correct that a wrongly constructed monetary union harms and divides Europe. You say it yourself. Your foreword says: “The European Monetary Union is not yet sufficiently capable of stopping and reversing the social and economic drifting apart of the euro countries resulting from the crisis.” That is a crucial sentence. Why is that? We have an incorrect relative exchange rate within the euro zone. The euro is valued too low for Germany and too high for the countries of the south. In Germany we go from record to record. In the countries of the south, unemployment remains at a sadly high level. Now Draghi has tried to hold that together with a zero interest rate policy. But at some point it has to move to normal rates and then it falls apart. And what are you going to do now? The next phase of communalization. I tell you: you cannot get rid of different development skills and different competitiveness by pooling risks - that's just the way it is.

For the first time in a while we are feeling more optimistic about the future of our project; that is great news. But before we rush into asking for more new instruments, maybe we should use all our energies to make sure that the current ones work properly. Implementation and enforcement are fundamental for our future. A good application of EU law is basic in order to regain the support of our citizens and increase the efficiency of our monetary union.  For the future of the euro we need to ensure that all Member States comply with the relevant EU economic legislation. Take the Late Payments Directive, for example. As you well know, more than one million jobs have been lost in the south of Europe in recent years due to the bad practices on payments by central banks and big enterprises, forcing thousands of solvent SMEs to close. A business is only made when it is cashed. This is the basis of our model. We need to ensure this before talking about more integration.  So, in my opinion it is better to concentrate our political capital on the outstanding projects that we have initiated, before beginning new ones. For instance, we have to implement the bail-in legislation in a consistent manner in all Member States and all Member States already have to implement correctly the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive.  Moreover, we have to rethink our current economic governance framework. Implementation of the deficit rules is still not satisfactory and many recommendations in the European Semester are never implemented by Member States. I hope that in the coming years we will do all this and leap forward in our euro integration, but before we think about eurobonds or an economic treasury, a European treasury, we have to ensure that this is properly done. Finally, I think that the best way to achieve economic convergence in the eurozone is not through massive fiscal transfer between Member States, but by sharing and extending economic and financial best practices among us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 143, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Miguel VIEGAS", "mepid": "125100", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - At a time of stalemate where the profound crisis of this model of European Union integration is all too evident, this reflection document represents a true flight forward.

To put it simply, without a full banking union, without a social, fiscal and democratic union, the euro is doomed to disappear. This evidence, the reflection document tabled by the Commission two weeks ago, recognizes it, but only in the background. It is added to those proposed in 2012 by Barroso, on the one hand, and by Van Rompuy, on the other, and to the famous report of the five presidents tabled in 2015. We have therefore been beating around the bush for five years, because it lacks the vision and the political will to act. Yes, we need to complete the banking union by adding to common supervision and common crisis management a common deposit guarantee backed by a common fiscal public safety net. Yes, we need a euro zone budget to invest in particular in the energy transition, because, deployed counter-cyclically, it will cushion macroeconomic shocks, but it will also improve the strength of the European economy. Yes, we need to deepen the solidarity between our social protection systems, for example with a common unemployment reinsurance system. Finally, if we are to tackle excessive deficits, whether they be trade balance deficits or budget deficits, we must tackle excessive surpluses with equal force, because they are just as harmful as the former. Likewise, we must stop the excessive growth of both public and private debts, because their increase is a sign of danger. None of this can happen without strong democratic control. The European Parliament and national parliaments must be closely involved in this device. Dear colleagues, to share a currency is to share a common good. This presupposes both strong solidarity and an equally strong sense of shared responsibility. All this is only possible with common rules, for example for the financial sector. On that note, let me tell you that what we've been witnessing over the past year is more of a quiet unraveling of the few progress we've made rather than the simplification and tightening of the rules that we need. . We certainly have budgetary rules, but experience shows us that they are inapplicable, quite simply because they are procyclical, that is to say that they worsen the situation when it is already serious and that , combined with the neoliberal doxa which continues to dominate this assembly, the Commission and the Council, they mean that it is the weakest shoulders which find themselves carrying the heaviest part of the burden. Rather than freeing ourselves from the rules, we must have the courage to transform them, both financially and in terms of the budget, so that they regain their meaning, that is to say that of defending the general interest. I will end, Madam, if I may, by saying that Europe is a symbol. Some would like to make it a symbol of financial oppression.

We have a currency that has created clear imbalances because it has been placed in a non-optimal currency context. These imbalances are not successes, because it was the citizens who saved the euro, devaluing wages in the peripheral countries and creating the conditions of competitiveness that the Commission strongly demands, driven by the neoliberal policies that are required by globalists and the market. With this situation and this analysis, perhaps we can identify what the problems are. In a functioning monetary economic union there are contributions from countries in surplus and enjoying the benefits linked to the single currency towards depressed areas. Perhaps with this intellectual honesty we could try to find a solution. But I don't see the Nordic countries that enjoy these surpluses wanting to do this kind of political action and therefore it is very difficult to be pro-European at the moment, when there is no intellectual honesty on the part of those who put \"Germany first\" - so to speak - for several years within the European Union. Even on banks, I'm sorry to say, the solutions that are applied adopt wrong weights and measures because, if we analyze the situation from 2011 to 2013, which led European countries to take action on banks, we see how there is a distorted competitive situation , where banking systems like the German one have received almost 250 billion and have created aid situations, which today are not allowed in Italy, for example, when the banking system needs to give a hand to what the system is credit, in turn put under pressure from the neoliberal market and the Basel rules.By putting these principles under the magnifying glass, perhaps solutions could be found but, since I do not see this in the Commission proposal, I think it is more appropriate to speak of a position of disintegration of the currency union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 146, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Barbara KAPPEL", "mepid": "125024", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - Madam President, Commissioner! In addition to a sustainable solution to the refugee problem and a realignment of defense policy, the reform of the Economic and Monetary Union is certainly a very important topic and a very important step for the future of Europe and the euro zone. This reflection paper reflects the Commission's opinion on this. I agree with one thing you said today, Commissioner Moscovici: this House should be included in the dialogue to a greater extent, because this is the only way to ensure democratic legitimacy. But the Member States are also very active now. As you know, a working paper between Germany and France on reforming the eurozone is expected by July. A common budget for the euro zone including euro finance ministers, common taxes and secured debt options, a mutualisation of unemployment insurance and deposit insurance are, in my view, not effective answers to the problems of monetary union. What the monetary union needs is not more redistribution and more transfer, but more personal responsibility, more competitiveness and compliance with the current deficit and debt rules. The euro crisis in particular has shown that hardly any member state adheres to the Maastricht criteria. Why also? Anyway, no real consequences are foreseen. The economic and monetary union does not need any further communitisation of debts in the form of Eurobonds or ESBies.

We can only do this if we strengthen the credibility in the system. That means that we have to deliver based on the instruments currently available to us. That is certainly the starting point, and the Commission rightly recognizes that. The European Economic and Monetary Union has its very own architecture. The EU Commission is right when it says that we should not copy a national or international model. We would like to build on our existing system by strengthening the application of rules, achieving a better link between national reforms and European controls and means, striving for economic convergence and thus greater competitiveness, and strengthening decision-making processes in the Union and, above all, making them more transparent. The completion of economic and monetary union must remain open to all EU member states. Membership in the euro should not become a symbol of separation, but a symbol of prosperity and competitiveness.

First of all: from our point of view, the Commission has put forward good proposals - they point in the right direction. We need more of a common economic and financial policy in the eurozone - there is no getting around it if we want to keep the whole thing together. That now also means: The ball is now in the playing field of the member countries. The member states must now finally - after years of non-functioning cooperation behind closed doors in the Eurogroup - find their way back to the ground of European democracy and submit their own strong proposals on how we can get ahead. The proposals that you have put forward must now produce results. The European Central Bank can no longer be solely responsible for holding the euro area together. The damage this creates is always greater and irresponsible. The answer to that means, however, that we have to come to a common economic and financial policy in Europe instead of insulting Mario Draghi. Incidentally, I also think it is correct that you have not submitted any joint state insolvency proceedings, moreover - as Mr Balz suggested - without allowing any transfers at the same time. Why? That would drive the eurozone apart again, because of course the weaker states would have to bear correspondingly higher burdens for their national debt. So we're driving the euro apart - instead of making sure that it sticks together. The point now must be that these reforms are not implemented intergovernmentally - i.e. around a deepening of the European stability mechanism, as Mr Schäuble would like - but within the framework of the European treaties: a common budget, a euro finance minister, i.e. an EU commissioner , who also chairs the Eurogroup, also has more social responsibility and investments.We can do all of this within the framework of the contracts.Let's do it!", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 156, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Patrick O'FLYNN", "mepid": "124940", "text": "   – Madam President, eurozone leaders remain mired in denial.

Tell that to Italians, whose economy is not much bigger than it was at the turn of the century! Tell it to Greeks, whose death rates have soared amid the collapse of the healthcare system! Mr Dombrovskis says recovery is firmly under way, after having incorrectly anticipated it for several years, but this so-called eurozone recovery is akin to a drunk managing to stagger three consecutive paces in a straight line. We know it is going to lurch face first into a brick wall at any moment, because this is a flawed political construct. To trap Greece and other southern economies in the same currency as Germany is simply folly. These economies need their own currencies that can depreciate to protect their activity levels in the face of Germany’s superior productivity path. They do not have Germany’s scale, brands, R&amp;D budgets, communications infrastructure, technical education system, export networks, harmonious industrial relations or work ethic. Even their climates dictate a daily pause in activity. But instead of navigating back toward sensible economics, the EU keeps using the ideology of integration as its lodestar. Even Romania and Bulgaria are expected to join the euro, lining them up for the same fate as has been visited upon Greece.

How we will make the Euro more stable by the year 2025? This is the key topic of the reflection paper put forward by the Commission which we are discussing this afternoon. A more stable euro and a more stable Economic and Monetary Union will undoubtedly lead to more growth, more investment and more jobs. The stability of the euro and the job creation process in the European Union is one of the main concerns of the citizens of the European Union, and this is why we have to address this.  How should we achieve this? Firstly: by respecting existing rules. More than 20 Member States of the Union, over the course of the recent years, have been in excessive deficit procedures. We still have six excessive deficit procedures open right now. We should not start now by questioning the rules which we have given to ourselves, but we should start by applying these rules, because, as we know, unsustainable debt leads to loss of trust, loss of credibility and is also a big burden for the economy. Besides respecting the rules, what should we do? Firstly, we should encourage and support the Member States of the Union to reform, to improve their competitiveness and to strengthen their economies. If this economic reality leads to the conclusion that we should adjust our institutional framework through the creation of a treasury and a finance minister, then we should be ready to think about this and to discuss it, but we should not start the debate about improving our economy by new changes in our institutional set—up in Brussels.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 158, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Pervenche BERÈS", "mepid": "1985", "text": "- Madam President, Mr Vice-President, Commissioner, thank you for this diagnosis. This is a useful line of thought in defending the common good that is the euro. For both political and economic reasons, we must preserve it. You will enlighten us on its weaknesses: it is useful to highlight the need to complete the Economic and Monetary Union, as has already been done in the report of the four presidents, in the report of the five presidents and in many resolutions of this Parliament, including the last on a budget for the euro zone. This analysis can be completed, because it is also necessary to point out the flaws in the conception of Economic and Monetary Union in its current state and in its development, which lead to the existence of rules that are too complex, too opaque, sometimes totally unsuitable and which induce a bias contrary to the investment necessary for the functioning of the euro zone itself. In the diagnosis, it seems to us perhaps that a sense of urgency is relatively lacking, because we are at a time when the strategic interest of the euro area needs to be reaffirmed, including in the context of Brexit . I would like to focus more on the solutions you are proposing, many of which are in line with what we are supporting and what we are working for, starting, as Commissioner Moscovici has indicated, with an arrangement that allows a more democratic functioning of the euro zone itself.

I know we shouldn't make the boat too heavy, but all the same, we cannot divide our resources. You are proposing macroeconomic stabilization mechanisms: we welcome it, this is an essential avenue.

This raises a question that is often asked with a view to Germany, namely: Can we create more convergence by weakening the stronger members of the monetary union? I think this is the wrong way to go. We have to ensure that the weaker members can catch up, and that requires resolute reform policies. I am optimistic about France. I'm not that optimistic about Italy; I'm very worried about that. Second point: stabilization. There can be no-fault shocks, asymmetrical shocks. That is why it is right to upgrade the European Stability Mechanism.

If we want to take steps towards perfecting the eurozone, we will have to work mainly on restoring confidence, and you do that through concrete measures. Yes, also through a European insurance system for deposits, but a system based on responsibilities where they belong: in the Member States and in Europe. It is not the case that you can shift your responsibility to the European level and then as a member state can say: save it.

It is an ambitious and realistic document, at the same time, which in many points reflects the proposals put forward by this Parliament and which must now be transformed into a concrete roadmap. As for the financial union, the measures necessary for its completion are clear: guarantees and deposits, backstops just waiting to be concluded. With regard to the Economic and Fiscal Union, it is instead necessary to exit quickly from the stage of possible scenarios and undertake with courage and determination the one indicated by Parliament, and also present in the paper, namely the realization of an exchange between reinforced and binding mechanisms convergence of economic policies and the construction of a budgetary capacity of the euro area, to be placed in the Union budget and to be used for stabilization functions, of which the most effective is undoubtedly that of a European unemployment benefit. In this sense, it is useful to point out that this allowance does not require a prior harmonization of labor market rules, but on the contrary can contribute, together with other instruments, to create the conditions for greater convergence in this area. It is also important to clarify that, as Parliament has shown, both the Convergence Guidelines and the Fiscal Capacity can be implemented under constant treaties, without resorting to intergovernmental solutions, and on the basis of the Community method, which is the only one that can allow a appropriate democratic control. In this sense, I welcome the Commissioner's invitation to formalize the dialogue between Parliament and the Commission on the Semester, which for us is not an arrangement but an interinstitutional agreement. As far as the safe asset issue is concerned, this is a very important issue and positive, which of course needs to be addressed carefully to avoid risks to financial stability.Finally, as regards the integration of the Fiscal Compact, the lesson of recent years is that there is recovery and confidence, also because the rigid austerity policy has been overcome.So integration of the Fiscal Compact if there is its reform.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 164, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Peter van DALEN", "mepid": "96809", "text": "- The same mistake is often made in the European Union.When a problem is difficult, the big leap forward is made.Clear exit criteria for the euro are still lacking, but instead of establishing them, the Commission is now taking a giant leap forward.Unfortunately, no thought is given to how to solve the existing problems.What are those problems?France and a number of southern member states are not reforming the labor market and are not reforming financial-economic relations as the Netherlands and Germany have already done.The result is that debts remain and that unemployment grows.What has to happen?The instruments of the Stability and Growth Pact need to be used and perhaps slightly tightened.We should not incur joint debts.Countries themselves must implement reforms and reduce debt.Such a big step forward with a total EMU is really not necessary for that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Matt CARTHY", "mepid": "124986", "text": "   – Madam President, in typical Commission fashion, a European unemployment insurance scheme is dangled like a carrot to gain public support, while the trade-off is the harmonisation of labour relations and anti-worker reforms.

These are the steps the Commission can think of to do this. But that is curing the symptoms, it is not addressing the causes. The reason for this is that productivity developments are different in different countries. We cannot simply wish that they experience the same productivity developments everywhere, but we must acknowledge that they are different and that either wages will then develop very differently, which will lead to the EU or at least the euro zone becoming stronger Tensions are exposed, or that we have to abolish the euro so that the devaluations that previously led to convergence in the euro zone can take hold again.

In my opinion, instability was structurally ingrained in the euro concept. And now, as the failure becomes more apparent, we see that it is precisely this instability that you are using to push through your further European integration, your political integration. It is that instability of the currency that is used to smooth out the differences, and in that reflection paper that you are coming up with now, you come up with a political project in a pretty impudent way. A political project not only of the Banking Union and of the Capital Markets Union and of the Resolution Fund, but also of a fundamental continuation of the convergence standards and of a European Finance Minister and a European Parliament, and of course of European debt securities. You want to continue to smooth out the differences, which is precisely the un-European aspect of this entire project. The differences that have made Europe great, the differences in competition that have brought Europe to well-being and prosperity, are further smoothed out and we believe that this is a serious, fundamental mistake. It is the mistake that the European Union always makes: if there is a problem, there must be more European Union, the flight ahead. In our opinion, pushing through a political straightjacket to political unity is un-European. This is particularly the case with the monetary policy of your ECB.

This creates huge social hardship which, when unfairly distributed, undermines the legitimacy of EMU. As in the Five Presidents’ report, the Commission paper lists the tools that could, if properly used, help to counteract these two major flaws. However, experience has shown that tools lined up to address the problems of European integration – unless they are properly structured through political agreement – correct symptoms while leaving underlying problems to fester. This has been the case with the application of the two—pack and six—pack process, so we have budgetary balances while public investment remains in decline. Any new structural change in the eurozone’s structure would need a prior political agreement between eurozone members regarding how such change would operate. Leaving it to be guided by free market forces or making it subservient to the dogma that there can be no transfer union would again simply give greater impetus to divergences while allowing social unfairness resulting from internal devaluation to grow.

Obviously, as you can imagine, the Commission feels closer to those who want to give the euro area greater strength and greater ambition than to those who believe in ideas, in my view quite regressive, that it is good. to undo it and come back to some sort of previous situation, for which we must not keep nostalgia. I would just like to make two points in this conclusion. The first is that I am convinced that it is time to make the euro a tool for shared growth and not just stability. That’s what it is about. The crucial question is that of convergence and the reduction of territorial, social and economic inequalities within the euro zone to assume the cohesion of the euro and to fight against Euroscepticism which in turn feeds populism. . From this point of view, there is a notion that I retain from your debate, which is that we must strike a balance between the tools of solidarity, which are essential, and the principle of solidarity as well as the rules without which there is no euro zone that holds. But, at the same time, all this must be integrated in all fields: financial, economic and monetary. Finally, my last remark cuts across all the speeches that have been made here, and that is that we need more democracy in the euro zone but not more technocracy. We need to be accountable, we need transparency. There are, in fact, situations which cannot last indefinitely and which do not concern - you were right to say this, Mr Papadimoulis - only Greece, but which concern us all. A euro zone budget must be voted on and must be controlled. For this it is very clear that even though parliaments national governments play an important role, in my opinion, it is the European Parliament which must play the leading role and which must be at the heart of this democratic construction.This debate is only just beginning.It is to be continued and we will continue it with you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 192, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking the honourable Members for this debate.

The carcinogenity and the genotoxicity of the substance are confirmed by certain studies but denied by others. The fact is, that it is undeniable that there are serious doubts as to the substance’s safety. The Commission keeps on insisting that it arrives to its decisions based on two things: scientific evidence and the rule of law. The issue we are dealing with today goes further. It is about the lack of transparency; it is about questionable scientific reliability and scientific independence. It is about losing public trust and about corporate giants overstepping their authority – and yes, transparency matters. The glyphosate hazard classification process of the European Commission and its two agencies, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), appears to be a good example of how lack of transparency regarding the scientific evidence that underlies important public health decisions can end up eroding public trust and raise serious concerns. Independent analysis indicates serious flaws in the EFSA and ECHA safety assessments – namely, eight instances where increases in tumours as a response following glyphosate exposure were not included in the assessment by either agency. In March 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which forms part of the World Health Organisation, said that glyphosate was ‘probably carcinogenic to humans’. On the other hand, the Commission is claiming that ECHA and EFSA concluded that the available scientific evidence did not meet the criteria to classify glyphosate as a carcinogen, as a mutagen or as toxic for reproduction. No wonder that questions and doubts still exist. Is it too extreme to imagine that there could be an expert panel, financed by corporate giants, who would conclude that available data will not support the conclusion that that glyphosate is a ‘probable human carcinogen’? How can we be sure of the validity of the conclusions about the safety or otherwise of glyphosate when there is lack of transparency, and when it has been publicly revealed by the latest US court cases that the scientific data provided by the company experts was falsified? We have to take a strong stand on this issue. Until we know for certain that glyphosate is safe for our citizens and the environment, we cannot allow this substance to be freely sold in the EU market. And this is why we are presenting this Oral Question: we want to understand what steps the Commission is taking to make sure that the decision on the renewal of glyphosate is based on credible and independent scientific findings. We want the Commission to recommend ECHA and EFSA to critically revise the validity of the current studies, and not to propose the approval of glyphosate as long as the scientific uncertainties have not been clarified. We also require the Commission to rapidly ensure an independent review of the classification of glyphosate in relation to hormone disruption, genotoxicity and carcinogenity. Finally, we want the Commission to promote and support the agricultural sector so that our farmers can move towards glyphosate-free agriculture, and towards alternative sustainable and cost-efficient solutions for pest management. We asked precise questions on behalf of the Environment Committee to the Commission, and we are looking forward to precise detailed answers.

I hope that you will allow me a bit of time to insist on this point as it was repeatedly requested by various Members of this House who asked for the debate today, and of course I had slightly different questions compared to those which I received in writing. I believe that it is of the utmost importance to reply as precisely as possible to the specific questions raised by honourable Members. On the chronology of events: as you know, glyphosate is the most frequently used active substance in herbicide products in Europe as it is has already been on the national markets since 1970s. It was previously subject to national approval processes. Since 1 July 2002, this substance has been approved for use at European Union level after a review assessment. It is currently under evaluation as regards a possible renewal of its approval. This evaluation is done following the procedures laid down in the EU legislation concerning pesticides. This is a very strict legislation which you wisely contributed to put it in place. In April 2015, in accordance with the legislation, a comprehensive assessment of all available data was carried out by the Rapporteur Member State, Germany. This assessment included both studies that industry legally has to submit and independent peer—reviewed scientific literature. This assessment was then also peer reviewed by all other European Union Member State bodies and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) – a lot of bodies together, as you can see. An agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), also carried out an assessment and concluded, in March 2015, that glyphosate is ‘probably carcinogenic’ to humans (Classification Group 2a). This is why, taking into account public concern, I asked EFSA to ensure that the IARC assessment was fully considered in the EU peer review of glyphosate.  In November 2015, EFSA concluded, in contrast to IARC, that glyphosate is unlikely to pose a carcinogenic hazard to humans. But the same conclusion was also reached by all – except one – of the regulatory agencies in the European Member States: 27 agencies. In 2016-2017, the same conclusions were also reached by agencies in Japan, New Zealand, Canada and Australia – a lot of agencies worldwide. In May 2016, the Joint Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and WHO Meeting on Pesticide Residues also reached their conclusions, taking into account the work of IARC, which was only a first step in the WHO assessment. I would like to draw your attention to the fact that, even without mentioning tobacco, solar radiation or processed meat – alcoholic beverages are, for instance, classified by IARC in Group 1 as ‘carcinogenic to humans’, contrary to glyphosate. But only glyphosate is high on the agenda in public debates. Does this mean that I should label processed meat or alcoholic beverages as carcinogens, or even ban them? That is an open question.  In 2016, the Commission discussed a possible renewal of the approval of glyphosate with the Member States. Following the divergent opinions between, as I mentioned, IARC and EFSA – and also between different Member States – on the carcinogenic potential of glyphosate, the Commission took a cautious approach, also in light of legitimate public concern. We also used the precautionary approach and therefore made a proposal to extend the expiry date of glyphosate until 31 December 2017 (at the latest!) to enable the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) to deliver its opinion on the hazardous properties of glyphosate based on the proposal from the Rapporteur Member State, namely Germany. In parallel, in April 2016, your House adopted a resolution asking to renew glyphosate for seven years. As always, the Commission was very attentive to this expression of Parliament’s position. We took good note of your support for a renewal of the approval based on scientific assessment conducted in the EU. Lastly, on 15 March 2017, ECHA’s Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) concluded that glyphosate should not be classified as carcinogenic, mutagenic or toxic for reproduction. In recent weeks various sources have reported on the so—called ‘Monsanto papers’. First, the facts. According to media reports and correspondence sent to the Commission, a US Court ordered the release of documents following a freedom of access to documents request, which you mentioned in your speech. I will now turn to your first question. You rightly pointed to a very important aspect: ‘in light of public concern, to ensure credible and independent scientific findings’. In this field, as in others, I heard and listened to public concerns and many questions are legitimate and I am happy to provide you once again with answers. From 2014 when I took office, I have indeed received a lot of letters, messages and emails concerning glyphosate, together with a European Citizens’ Initiative registered in January this year, a request for a urine sample last year, and even a citizens’ Monsanto Tribunal. This shows a real picture of different opinions and concerns. We are working on this. For some people, glyphosate is a symbol of intensive agriculture and strongly linked to GMOs. This debate is broader than glyphosate, but this is why the need to maintain a strong scientific assessment in this context is crucial. We will also always take public concern very much into account. This is why we asked EFSA and ECHA to indicate what impact the allegations, if confirmed, would have on the Agencies’ overall assessment and conclusions on glyphosate.  Both ECHA and EFSA reached the same conclusion. EFSA confirmed that: ‘even if the allegations regarding ghost-writing proved to be true, there would be no impact on the overall assessment as presented in the EFSA Conclusion on glyphosate’. ECHA confirmed that: ‘the information contained in the so—called “Monsanto papers” did not have an impact on the overall assessment as presented in the draft opinion of the Committee for Risk Assessment (RAC) on 15 March 2017’. This is because ‘EU experts had access to the raw data and to the original study reports’ and they produced their own independent conclusions based on the original data and not on another interpretation of it.  In contrast, the articles mentioned were study reviews summarising or substantiating the industry position on glyphosate that had been presented elsewhere. These study reviews were known by all assessing bodies and are not new as they were mentioned in the Declarations of Interests of the participating experts.  In other words, the study reviews have limited weight in the overall scientific assessment of glyphosate and, I quote, ‘would not normally on their own be sufficient for a conclusion to be reached on a harmonised classification’. This answer is from scientific bodies. The statements of both agencies have been available online since last week. Overall, there is thus broad convergence between the European and international community of scientists on the fact that glyphosate is not carcinogenic, keeping an eye on public opinion and different views around the world. All agencies – in Japan, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, the EU – came to the same conclusion and only one agency, IARC, had a different opinion. It was little strange to see that so many scientific bodies agreed but we will ask once again how to move forward, keeping an eye on scientific based arguments.  While individual persons may continue to disagree with this overwhelming convergence of scientific opinions, this cannot call into question the robustness of our system and we should proceed with the renewal of the approval of glyphosate as there is no reason to doubt the evidence-based arguments about the safety of the substance. Therefore the Commission decided, in light of public concern, to propose a renewal for ten years. In parallel, three very clear recommendations to Member States were adopted last year: first, to ban the co—formulant Tallowamine from glyphosate-based products; second, to minimise use in public parks, public playgrounds and gardens; and, third, to be attentive to the pre-harvest use of glyphosate. Let me also recall that, even if glyphosate is approved at EU level, it is within the responsibility of Member States to authorise plant protection products containing glyphosate at national level and decide on the conditions of use. They of course have the right to ban it because it concerns co-formulants. The Commission is therefore not the only one to decide when it comes to pesticides.  On your second sub-question, on investigation, let me stress that, in the case you refer to, the Commission does not have any proof that the allegations are correct. I am not a lawyer but I know that we have a very thorough assessment. Let me turn now to your second question. I can confirm that the way in which data and information is provided to the regulatory authorities and shared with the public for consideration of the approval of substances will be examined in the context of the REFIT evaluation of the European Union pesticides legislation. Indeed the Commission is specifically asking the external contractor that will conduct an external study on the preparation of the REFIT evaluation to look into this issue. This is actually reflected in the terms of reference which are publicly available, as is everything we do.  As the REFIT evaluation of the EU pesticide legislation and the fitness check of the General Food Law are still ongoing, it is a little bit too early to make assumptions or consider a different course of action at this stage. However, I would like to stress that the outcome of the fitness check of the General Food Law will also be publicly available, once completed, and the outcome of the REFIT evaluation of the EU pesticide legislation will be presented to this Parliament.  In the meantime, I am aware that Parliament is preparing an own—initiative report on the implementation of the Plant Protection Products Regulation. The Commission will of course carefully examine this report and its conclusions once it is finalised and will consider this during the preparation of the REFIT evaluation.  I will now turn to your third question. Let me start by first highlighting that the process of examining the claims made by companies to exclude the public release of certain information is, of course, directly managed by EFSA and Member States. Such claims are considered in conjunction with the rules outlined in the Plant Protection Products Regulation and the relevant rulings of the Court of Justice.  In this context, the Court of Justice rulings of November 2016 in relation to the implementation of the Aarhus Convention in the EU concern two important issues: first, access to confidential information related to the manufacturing and detailed composition of substances, in this case concerning the original approval of glyphosate; and, second, disclosure of studies on substances and formulated products submitted to Member States in the context of product authorisation. In the first ruling the Court of Justice referred the case back to the General Court and the proceedings before the Court are still pending. As regards the protection of confidentiality and access to information at issue in this case, the Commission is awaiting the outcome. I can assure you that I welcome the initiative to have more clarity in this field. There is no doubt that we need more clarity.  In the second case, the Court of Justice defined information on emissions into the environment with regard to studies submitted for active substances in plant protection and biocidal products. The Commission and the Member States are currently assessing the consequences of this judgment.  I would like to emphasise the following: first, at my request, the companies applying for renewal of the approval of glyphosate made available to Members of Parliament and stakeholders the key studies underlying the assessment of glyphosate in a reading room; and, second, in addition EFSA provided Members of Parliament and stakeholders with access to raw data from a number of key studies, following a request for access to documents. This access is on top of the extensive documentation that had already been made available as part of the standard procedures by EFSA during the peer review of glyphosate.  Therefore, one can only conclude that there has been a particularly high level of transparency in the specific case of glyphosate in the light of public concern. I understand that this might not be enough for some of you in this House and I am also aware that a complaint is about to be lodged with the Court of Justice. Once again, I can only welcome the increased clarity that the Court would give on this matter.  Let me now turn to your fourth and last question. I would like to stress that the Commission, through its research and innovation programmes – such as the Seventh Framework Programme and Horizon 2020 – supports a broad body of research in plant protection to identify new low—risk products and biological control techniques. This is what I highlighted again last week in a very interesting conference in Parliament on biological low—risk pesticides.  Let me stress again that in the Seventh Framework Programme over EUR 100 million was invested by the European Union in cooperative research projects and coordination support actions in the areas of plant protection, plant health, integrated pest management, and risk assessment and diagnostics.  Furthermore, specifically in relation to alternatives to chemical herbicides, a Horizon 2020 initiative, supported by an EU contribution of EUR 7 million, is currently looking at strategies, tools and technologies for sustainable weed management. So, as you will notice, a lot of money has already been invested already in terms of research and development.  With regard to sustainable plant protection more specifically, the need to find alternatives to traditional chemical solutions is also reflected in the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive, which aims at reducing the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and the environment, and at promoting the use of integrated pest management and of alternative approaches or techniques such as non-chemical alternatives to pesticides.  The Commission audits Member States to monitor implementation of the Directive and also encourages Member States to share best practice, identify challenges and ensure harmonisation. The Commission is also undertaking several actions to increase the availability of low-risk products. These actions include prioritisation of the assessment for the renewal of potentially low-risk substances and amendment of the low-risk criteria to facilitate their identification.

You also said it, you referred to the \"Monsanto Papers\" and we both know the revelations that are made there. At the time when the American justice and the Californian court take up this situation, it appears, to our knowledge, that Monsanto would have known since 1999 that this molecule was potentially carcinogenic. Today, it is in this context that the debate has been rekindled, here, through this oral question. In any case and as far as I am concerned, I cannot take responsibility for it and I will not participate in what can or could potentially amount to a criminal act, as long as it is true that, if it were revealed It is true that glyphosate was potentially carcinogenic, we should collectively take great responsibility.

While some recent studies have noted successive cases of carcinogenic correlations of glyphosate, so that some Members even suspect European agencies of manipulating scientific data, it is in line with the above that I very openly call on the European Commission to, firstly, closely monitor and closely cooperate with the European Food Safety Authority and European Chemicals Agency and others. These agencies should also absolutely cooperate with the US Environmental Protection Agency to jointly develop some appropriate system, firstly for collecting and analyzing scientific data, but also working out a specific modus operandi to resolve ambiguities about glyphosate in the health context.

The ball is once again here at home in the European Parliament, fourteen months to the day after the vote on our resolution which already called for its ban in specific uses. From study to study, from agency to agency, from expert to second-expert, opinions follow one another and are not alike and there is no clarity, to put it mildly. Last March, it was the \"Monsanto Papers\" that set public opinion on fire in the United States. Declassified documents have spoken. Monsanto had serious concerns as early as 1999 about the mutagenic nature of glyphosate. A cover-up of evidence if there is, but the investigation will have to say so. The ALDE Group, which I represent, continues to trust and want to trust the work of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and the European Chemicals Agency (ECHA), which has its headquarters in Helsinki. We also know very well - and the Commissioner reminded them - that, on this dossier, as on GMOs, for example, the Member States hide their divisions and do not take their responsibilities. However, there is no more time to waste: the Commission’s roadmap should be based on a few principles. The Commission must ensure that its final decision is based on independent scientific studies and not on biased work and documents provided by Monsanto or other firms. In this transitional phase, before December, it is imperative for the Commission to change its model and finally move to a logic of progressive ban of the substance, rather than re-registration and derogation. We must also give the European agencies the means to achieve their ambitions. I find it quite shocking - I say this in passing - that EFSA's budget is almost four times that of the European Medicines Agency, when food is the third item of expenditure for European households.This is what you should do, Commissioner, but which you are most likely not going to do, given what you have just answered us this afternoon.Basically, all the elements are known, I quote you, there is nothing to declare, worse still, the \"Monsanto Papers\" will not change anything, circulate.It is a staggering end of inadmissibility, which I find regrettable, and I still use a euphemism, because, the main thing - and sometimes the obvious facts must be hammered out - is that your principle of actionpublic, it must be the precautionary principle, Commissioner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 206, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Kateřina KONEČNÁ", "mepid": "23699", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - What has been happening in recent years at the European Commission and EFSA regarding the authorization of glyphosate is outrageous.

In the meantime, one scandal after another is leaking over Monsanto and their already proven direct influence on the scientific studies of glyphosate. The study, which can reasonably be assumed, is also used by EFSA to support its position on the safety of glyphosate. At the same time, even after years of pressure, no one has seen these studies. They are still not even available to the International Agency for Research on Cancer, which has identified glyphosate as possibly carcinogenic. According to the leaked communication, it is clear that Monsanto did not even shy away from practices such as writing his own studies, which only some scientists eventually signed for them and subsequently pretending to be independent. In addition, for 17 years, the company has suspected that their flagship product is carcinogenic and is trying to cover it up to prevent it. And EFSA and the Commission are still silent. That is why it remains with the European Parliament again. Unless the European Commission urgently investigates how these Monsanto practices have affected EFSA's assessment of glyphosate, I would be in favor of setting up a committee of inquiry to examine the matter.

Although I agree that the release of recent confidential documents disclosed to the public in the US are reason for concern, we take the position that glyphosate is one of the few herbicides that our farmers have at their disposal, and compared to earlier products is safer. Glyphosate is the world’s most widely used herbicide, and such products are also used in public and private gardens, as well as in agriculture.

I would like to point out that, after intensive discussion, this Parliament took a position on glyphosate and adopted this position with a large majority. This is in contrast to the Council, where many Member States, including the one I come from, have ducked away. For political reasons there was no position. And I think we should build on that, and the Commission should better than before to listen to what Parliament has said on this matter. Glyphosate is a problematic substance. If, at the beginning of the debate on the Commission proposal, some Commission representatives said: 'You can drink it like water', then that was certainly wrong. You have to be very careful with it. But if it is used carefully and if it only happens in certain areas, then the use of glyphosate is acceptable for a limited time. That was decided by the European Parliament, and it certainly played a role in the fact that there are currently few alternatives. That is why I agree with Ms. Delahaye, who says: We have to do research, we have to bring new alternatives onto the market. But that takes time, and we cannot convert Europe completely to organic farming within a short period of time. Therefore: for a limited time, but that doesn't mean fifteen years, that doesn't mean ten years. Parliament says: a maximum of seven years. And we are in favor of many restrictions - more than the Commission has proposed. For me it is particularly important that the pre-harvest treatment stop. There is still the practice that the crop is killed with glyphosate before harvesting to facilitate the harvesting work. That is certainly not what we can represent with a clear conscience in front of our citizens.

This is a little different from what the Commissioner has said here. I filed the objection myself, so I remember it very well. I filed it against the Commission's proposal to authorize glyphosate for 15 years.

In my opinion, politicians would be well advised to focus less on emotions and more on scientific findings. But I also believe that it is right to intensify research here in order to ultimately have alternatives.

But when two agencies say it is safe, then I think to actually go against them, and especially to ask for a ban, does not make much sense to me. I have spoken to many farmers, horticulturists, etc. about this, and they are deeply concerned. Before you talk about any ban, you should have an impact assessment on what the effects are going to be. Are we going to allow the weeds to destroy the village farmers’ crops? The same for the horticulturists, the same for our gardens when glyphosate has been used for many decades and, to all intents and purposes, seems to be safe. We have, of course, to take public concerns into consideration. We have to allay people’s fears. But we can do so in a practical and logical manner. As the Commissioner pointed out, it is not just European agencies, agencies around the world have said similarly. So I think that this is an overreaction. We certainly have to be careful, we certainly have to be prudent and we have to allay, as I said, people’s fears. But in relation to Monsanto, they do not own the rights any more.

The precautionary principle must be strictly enforced, in particular, after the \"Monsanto papers\" which show that glyphosate is a potentially carcinogenic substance. Monsanto, as you know, will merge with Bayern at the end of the year.

However, may I draw your attention to this WHO report which I have here in my hand, because many of you quote the WHO’s International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Here is the IARC report too. I have both reports: from IARC and the WHO joint meeting on pesticide residues.  Two agencies – one and the other – which then decided – because this is the final decision – that glyphosate is unlikely to be carcinogenic. When you speak about the WHO, please read all the documents together, otherwise you will repeat the working group and the very active Professor Portier, who was a chair of the working group. I met him and we discussed this together. I was in Lyons, where we had a lot of discussions. I have visited all the agencies – IARC, EFSA – because I am not responsible to judge on science, colleagues, and I do not think all of you can judge on science.  It must be understood that we have our framework of actions and the framework is law. You mentioned the Monsanto papers but it is enshrined in law that Monsanto is obliged to present a study review, because this is enshrined in law. This law was adopted here in this House together with the Council.  I am responsible for following the law because the rule of law is my basic area in which to act and I would like to say to you, very openly, that we have a very precautionary approach, but do not mix up precautionary approach and precautionary principles. We do the same: we have a precautionary approach and then we use the precautionary principle: we ask EFSA, we ask the ECHA for an analysis. And then nowadays we have all the agencies at EU level. The 28 EU Member State agencies did the same. ECHA did the same, EFSA did the same. That is all, colleagues. Please, then, do not ask me to present another scientific review. I would like to present you with a scientific view that goes into a very detailed explanation but IARC and WHO are not European Union agencies, they are global agencies, but we take those outcomes into account too. Please tell me: how can I act in this situation? My answer is very simple. I would like to follow only plant protection product legislation. Otherwise I will be in a dangerous situation.  OK, I can show you all the materials I have. I have a lot of meetings with my colleagues from the S&amp;D Group. I have a lot of meetings with the Greens. I know very well that you have your own approach. Here is the Monsanto Tribunal paper. Here you can see the urine test. Here you can see seven reasons why we can ban glyphosate.  Colleagues, this is about politics, it is not about science. But I read it very carefully because some write, quite rightly, that it would be good to ban glyphosate because this would give a very good momentum to promoting organic farming. I am not against promoting organic farming but sorry, it is not about science! It is about your political platform! OK, I respect your political platform but I would like to follow the instruments which are in our hands. I know that scientists have a slightly different approach.  Professor Portier has one approach. John Little sent me a letter today and a lot of their working group people are very active discussing this. OK, we will continue those scientific discussions. I welcome those discussions. It would be good to organise scientific debates and move forward, but we must follow our legal obligations, and I would like to say very openly that I am ready to fulfil my legal obligations.  When I started in 2014 I had doubts because I listened to you and I had doubts about our European Union system. Today I would like to say very openly – let me reiterate this – that I firmly believe that the European Union system concerning the approval of active substances to be used in plant protection products is robust, trustworthy and ensures the highest safety standards for human and animal health and the environment. And this is true, colleagues. I spent two and a half years but I would like to say that today I am a big believer in our European Union safety system. Please follow me. I would like to invite you to organise debates and once again address those issues in a more detailed way.  I don’t know who is repeating that I said I can drink glyphosate as a glass of water. Sorry, I never, never, told you such a thing. I would like to mention that glyphosate is, as you know, labelled – this is a hazard classification –as corrosive, causing serious eye damage, hazardous to the environment and toxic to aquatic life, with long-lasting effects. This is on the label. OK, we need to move forward and to see how to manage the situation and how to keep our instruments to guarantee levels – hazard approach, risk approach – and then to fulfil our obligations and of course also finalise our decision. Otherwise it will be very difficult.  Please look, research the consequences of ignoring science and EFSA conclusions in the field of plant health. We now have an entire region infected by Xylella in Puglia. Can you imagine the disaster in Puglia? There is no treatment for this, the only possibility is to remove the trees. Those people who attacked the EFSA proposal to remove those trees did not listen to me – and what is happening today in Puglia? But the scientific advice was clear.  With regard to conclusions about glyphosate, we have today conclusions built by ECHA. Then I have legal obligations, colleagues; six months or until the end of this year. I know that it is only me who will follow the rule of law but I would like to fulfil my obligations.  With regard to the idea to have an inquiry committee, please do it; I will be more than happy to look at your inquiry compared to the Monsanto Papers. Please do it because it will be very good to cooperate with you, and from the Commission side we have no grounds to start with the inquiry procedure but maybe parliamentarians have a bit more space for manoeuvre. Please do it. I will be more than happy to communicate, to coordinate our common knowledge and to present to you the whole picture.  Sorry, friends, but I would like to say that the Commission approach is very clear, based on science, based on precautionary principles. I am a medical doctor, colleagues, and I know how difficult it is to encourage my patients to use medicines in the proper way. You always know how difficult it is to manage medicines but without medicine you have no chance of moving forward.  I know some of you have it in mind to propose glyphosate-free agriculture in the EU. Yes, please do this, please organise a pilot project, encourage farmers to do it; but it is not up to me, it is not up to science. Friends, I am very happy to listen to you very carefully but, sorry, I do not touch all the questions about transparency because I have answers about transparency. I have discussed those issues in a very detailed manner together with EFSA, together with ECHA, together with IARC, together with those working groups and I think we will see possibilities after REFIT. Move forward, but we will do it together. You know, you are also responsible in regard to risk management and risk communication because those messages which are being disseminated today create distrust.  We live in a very difficult society where distrust in science creates a lot of problems. It does not matter what – medicines, vaccinations or plant protection products. Blaming each other is very dangerous. I would be happy to be the scapegoat, the bad guy, but I count on my teams, I count on DG SANTE, I count on our specialists, I count on our scientists around the world – a lot of scientific communities which presented a common picture. And only a few create a lot of problems. Sorry, friends, I would be more than happy to move forward together with you in responding to your questions, but I trust in science.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 253, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "Commissioner Andriukaitis!Especially your last speech convinced us that you listened to 32 opinions and statements.It was a real debate.I do not know if you have convinced them all, but undoubtedly everyone is satisfied that they participated in a decent exchange of views.I close the debate.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 254, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Beata GOSIEWSKA", "mepid": "124900", "text": "in writing. - Glyphosate has been widely used for years as an ingredient or as a stand-alone plant protection product and has been discussed for years as it is an extremely controversial substance.

Unfortunately, another attempt has been made to renew the authorization for its use, even though recent studies report further cases of carcinogenic effects of glyphosate, and the German environmental agency documented serious negative effects of glyphosate on biodiversity.

Regarding the United Nations, I share the deep regret of this House at the assassination of the two members of the United Nations group of experts and their Congolese colleagues in Kasai in March this year. I express my sincere condolences to their families, friends and colleagues.

The Catholic Bishops’ Conference provided leadership in facilitating this agreement and they deserve our particular recognition. But for that agreement to succeed, actors on all sides of the political spectrum have to act in the national interest. This is the only way to deliver elections before the end of 2017, and it is the only way to restore full constitutional legitimacy to DRC. Regrettably, it is clear that the inclusivity required for a successful transition has not yet been achieved – this is the reality – in particular as regards the composition of the current government and on the leadership of the National Council for the Monitoring of the Agreement.  The intimidation and arbitrary arrests of opponents and activists, and politically motivated prosecutions, do not contribute to such an environment. I agree with the call made in the resolution for the need to ensure that investigations of violence and killings take place quickly and that they are demonstrably independent and transparent. This is an issue that we will be pursuing bilaterally with DRC, but also at multilateral level, and particularly in the current session of the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva.  Freedom of expression, including for the independent media, and freedom of association and assembly, must be guaranteed by the authorities. Now, unfortunately, we see too many restrictions.  As you know, my own responsibility covers humanitarian affairs. We cannot ignore the human impact of the outbreaks of violence in all three Kasai provinces, and the ongoing threats in other parts of the country where armed groups are active. The violence affecting civilian populations has already resulted in over 3.7 million refugees and internally displaced people, including 1.1 million in the Kasai region. We are in constant contact with the humanitarian actors on the ground, MSF and the Red Cross. ECHO Flight, the EU’s humanitarian air services, stands ready to intervene and provide them both with support when needed. We are also in contact with other donors to coordinate the next steps of the response to the growing needs in Kasai. This comes on top of our presence in the rest of the country, where we mobilise EUR 23 million this year for a wide range of humanitarian activities.  In responding to the political crisis and the violence and human rights abuses that it has generated, on 29 May the EU adopted individual restrictive measures against nine individuals. I want to be very clear about the use and context of these sanctions. They are not intended to replace justice – they are a tool intended to encourage a change in policy or in behaviour. Sanctions are reversible – we would be open to lifting them if those concerned were to demonstrate that they had turned away from violence. And sanctions are adaptable: the European Union would consider further listings for those – at any level, including the political level – who would obstruct the way to a peaceful and consensual end of the crisis.  I would like to end on a positive note. We believe there is potential for an African-led solution, in line with UN Security Council Resolution 2348. We are encouraged by the interest shown by the African Union, and by regional organisations such as the Southern African Development Community. We will support them as we also continue to definitely support MONUSCO, insisting on an energetic execution of its mandate. Resolution 2348 must be implemented in full and the DRC authorities should allow MONUSCO to fulfil its entire mandate with the necessary resources. This includes the protection of civilians in the areas most affected by violence. We must also not forget the risks presented to DRC’s neighbours and the need for contingency planning.  We will also maintain support to DRC and its people through projects and programmes. And we are, of course, if requested, ready to support the preparation of elections if progress is achieved, such as the successful completion of the voter roll, and a realistic calendar and budget.  Once again, please remain assured that despite the difficult situation, the European Union is ready and willing to take part in political and policy dialogue to the benefit of the rights and aspirations of all Congolese citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 258, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner very much for his statement, and I can say for my Group that we share his viewpoints and demands. The situation in the DRC is indeed terrible and it has been this way for quite a while, and I am deeply concerned about the handling of the current issue with regard to the Kasai province. You have rightly said that we have got 3.7 million internally displaced people, including the ones in the province of Kasai. Just three weeks ago, I had the privilege to speak as chair of the Delegation for Relations with the Pan—African Parliament (DPAP) in the Pan—African Parliament in Midrand, and I referred specifically to the situation in Kasai. After me, there were two other speakers from the DRC, and not a single one had the feeling that they would have to address this burning issue. That shows, in my mind, the attitude of those who are in charge there. As we speak, we’ve had a minister from the DRC, Liyota Ndjoli, who was contacting different MEPs here today, and I’m sure we have all given him the same message: fulfil the agreement of 31 December; prepare the elections properly. There is no way out, and if he says ‘well, perhaps a month or two later’, I will not accept; I think we should not accept anything unless there’s really a broad consensus with all political stakeholders. When it’s about one month more at the end I wouldn’t bother, but I have the feeling rather that Mr Kabila does not, in real terms, have a true intention to leave his office and his position, where he still sits, so we must keep up our pressure and also apply the sanctions that have been referred to and make it very clear that there is no alternative to fulfilling what has been agreed.

Today, no progress has been made in implementing the terms of that agreement and the general security situation has actually worsened. This is particularly the case in the Kasai province, where security forces and members of the Kamuina Nsapu militia continue to clash regularly. Reports suggest that in the last five months, 500 people have been killed in the fighting and a further 1.3 million people have fled the area. In North Kivu province, meanwhile, concerns remain about the activities of rebel groups including the March 23rd Movement and the Islamist militia known as Allied Democratic Forces.

Seven kilometers from Goma, women are raped when they leave the refugee camp to fetch water, because the Monusco soldiers, although they have the mandate to neutralize the rebels and the armed forces, are tourists-soldiers - who patrol the main axes and they are cantoned - because their national commanders forbid them to intervene.

In Kasai, which was once peaceful, violence and repression are raging. Since August 2016, summary executions, the murders of children, the recruitment of child soldiers and sexual violence have hit civilians. This violence, which involves militiamen, soldiers and police, has left more than 400 dead. More than 40 mass graves have been discovered, 400,000 children are at risk of famine, more than a million and a half Congolese have fled the region. This crisis in Kasai is playing out against the backdrop of what should be a political transition provided for by the agreement of 31 December 2016 and which is struggling to see the light of day. Even if the enrollment of voters seems to be accelerating, the adoption of electoral laws and the establishment of the National Council to monitor the agreement are all challenges to which the Congolese authorities must respond by holding free elections, transparent and democratic. In a serious context, the European Parliament calls on the Congolese authorities and the international community to do everything possible to respect all the commitments made in the New Year's Eve agreement, including the setting of a clear timetable and precise for the holding of elections, without modification of the Constitution. In addition, we call for the establishment of an international investigation into the violence in Kasai so that the perpetrators of these crimes can assume their responsibilities.

The disproportionate performance of the armed forces of the Democratic Republic of the Congo itself is of great concern. The country is awaiting elections. It is necessary for the European Union to force dialogue so that as soon as possible a democratically legitimized government can be had in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

The agreement of 31 December 2016 must be implemented, but unfortunately the talks are still stalled, as the country sinks into a hell of violence, denial of fundamental rights and freedoms, child soldiers, mass rape, malnutrition , war crimes and crimes against humanity. We ask that the Cotonou Agreement be finally applied, including its Article 96, which often remains an agreement of words and not of deeds.

It bears testimony to the EU attachment to the resolution of the crisis in the DRC.  The European Union’s link with the DRC is a link between citizens, between families and between communities. We care about the situation in this great country at the heart of Africa, so we want to do whatever we can using the tools at our disposal. First, to accompany the Congolese people through the current crisis; secondly, to support them and build accountable institutions that will stand the test of time; and third, to help them deliver good governance and, of course, a sustainable democracy.  From this debate, I conclude that we all share a common interest in engaging with the DRC authorities in order to carry the transition forward until the elections, provided that there is increased respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. If this is not the case, we will draw the consequences. So we will continue following closely the situation in the DRC in every dimension.  I completely agree with you that one of the most important issues is humanitarian access. I know this issue well because of my responsibility in my mandate, my portfolio, and as I discussed with some of you, I will try hard to find ways to reach vulnerable people in all regions of the DRC. This is why I have humanitarian access as a top priority, because it is the only way to provide humanitarian assistance to all people of the DRC. At the same time, I completely agree with you that we must keep up our pressure in every dimension in order to see as soon as possible democratic elections. It is the only pathway in order to see a better future for the Congolese people. At the same time, I greatly appreciate Parliament’s essential role in keeping the DRC on the international agenda. I can assure you that we will continue to use all tools at our disposal to assist in bringing a durable solution to the current crisis, and I engage to keep you fully informed on developments, in particular on humanitarian access.

Yemen was already one of the least developed nations in the world. After years of hostilities, we are now facing a daunting catastrophe where millions of lives are at stake, and this is now unfortunately aggravated by a severe cholera outbreak. As you know, the war in Yemen has caused one of the worst humanitarian crises – perhaps the very worst. According to the UN, one child is dying of hunger in Yemen every 10 minutes – a shocking number. Some 20 million people face the grim prospect of famine. The European Union, and now the Member States, recently pledged EUR 430 million in humanitarian aid, out of a total of over EUR 1 billion pledges at the Geneva pledging Conference in April. I was there; I represented the European Union, and I saw the fatigue of the international community regarding the humanitarian crisis across the world, but again the European Union was the biggest donor in this crisis. I agree totally with the UN Secretary-General that it is now time for urgent action. These pledges must be translated immediately into the concrete action that the people of Yemen need and deserve. Humanitarian access remains an issue for the international community. For this reason, we have reached out to the warring parties to push for facilitated access to the populations in need, while requesting an end to all violations of International Humanitarian Law. But the EU cannot act alone; there must be a truly concerted international effort, and we will continue to actively promote it. We have always maintained, and we continue to believe, that there can be no military solution to this crisis. It is an illusion. As clearly stated in the EU Foreign Affairs Council Conclusions on Yemen of April 2017, we aim to continue to work with all parties towards a sustained cessation of hostilities. This is the first step. This should be monitored by the United Nations, and would serve as a first step towards the resumption of peace talks under the leadership of the UN.  We offer, as the European Union, our full support to the efforts to relaunch the political negotiations. We are ready to do all we can to create the conditions that would enable both sides to de-escalate and move towards a solution. The European Union has been involved in sponsoring a number of Track II and peacebuilding initiatives, and will step up its efforts in this regard. But it is essential that all international and regional actors engage constructively and in a coordinated manner. We have been providing considerable humanitarian assistance. Although there is no peace deal yet, the European Union and other development actors are already preparing the ground for early recovery and reconstruction in areas where access is possible. There are people in need who cannot wait until the war is over, as always. To complete this, we need to reactivate our development cooperation and prepare for the necessary future intervention. If we want peace, we must prepare for it. In this manner, we will be ready to effectively contribute to the re-building of Yemen when the moment comes. We will need to focus on sustainable job creation and improved livelihoods.  The war in Yemen is no longer a domestic or even a regional affair. We believe that the gradual destruction of the country’s infrastructure and social fabric is a major destabilising factor for the international community as a whole. Vast areas are already controlled by terrorist groups such as al—Qaeda and Da’esh. Crucial maritime routes are endangered by the hostilities, and there is a real danger that piracy will re-emerge. The nature of the conflict is being exploited to fan the flames of sectarianism. These are all threats to international security that the European Union is determined to tackle, together with likeminded partners.

It is high time – and this is a real appeal to the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the Member States – that the EU develops a common position vis-à-vis Yemen, and at least that Member States stop exporting weapons to Saudi Arabia, which, together with the coalition, continues to indiscriminately bomb civilians and block the ports of Hodeidah, which in turn exacerbates the humanitarian situation. Of course, the Iranian side must also stop fighting a proxy war in Yemen. Last year, this House called for an arms embargo to Saudi Arabia because of its role in Yemen. It is a very important signal that we must repeat, and at least the call of last year is still very valid if we look at the incredible and unnecessary suffering of millions and millions of people.

Since the armed conflict in Yemen escalated in 2015, the humanitarian disaster has worsened dramatically. Seven million people are at acute risk of famine.

In view of this worsening catastrophe, I very much welcome the fact that the European Union decided at the Yemen donors' conference to provide additional aid measures worth 116 million. The hunger in Yemen is caused by the war. Therefore, humanitarian aid is not enough. The EU must act more decisively to end the armed conflict.

The European Parliament voted in favor of an arms embargo against Saudi Arabia in February 2016. Nevertheless, numerous EU states continue to deliver weapons to the Gulf state. That has to be over! Those who deliver weapons to warring parties risk complicity in war crimes. The EU must support a political solution led by the UN. You, Commissioner, have listed many such initiatives.

With humanitarian assistance already struggling to reach those in need, there is continued concern that the Houthi—held port of Hodeidah may be the target of an attack on the Saudi-led coalition. Given that approximately 75% of Yemen’s food supplies enter the country via this port, the devastating consequences of its destruction cannot be underestimated. The campaign continues to be marked by the disproportionate level of civilian casualties and very poor targeting of Saudi ordinance in their air campaign. The growing footprint of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) in parts of Yemen is also of grave concern, as are reports that suggest that the Saudi coalition has coordinated its attacks against the Houthis alongside AQAP. This is particularly worrying given the new US Administration’s continued hints that it may seek to play a more decisive role in supporting the Saudi-led coalition.

The country is slipping into famine, and this can only get worse as the conflict continues. And as you rightly mentioned before, now we have the cholera outbreak – another major tragedy; a blow into the eyes of humanity. The most important thing to emphasise here is that the two sides are starving because of the war; this is a manmade disaster, and it is very brutal on civilians. Both parties are turning starvation into a war instrument – just a war weapon. In addition, I have – and we have – the uncomfortable feeling that the international community and public opinion are turning their eyes from that dramatic conflict, attracted by other major global events.  It is a civilian war that is fuelled and supported by regional actors, a bloody image of a Shia-Sunni conflict in the Middle East. Why it is important today to underline this fact? Because this conflict can be ended with goodwill and with the support of other major regional and global actors, including the European Union, and it’s right to mention that Iran and Saudi Arabia – both being more or less our partners – should pay attention and should assume their regional responsibilities, because the responsibility there is bearing on their shoulders. It’s equally important to mention that they can destroy and they can devastate the whole region if the conflict will only continue.  It is dangerous today to take a side and, at the end of the day, the only thing which we should care about is human life. For that reason, I call first for pressure to be put on the two sides to stop the conflict immediately and to allow the humanitarian and medical aid; secondly, for full funding for the humanitarian response to be assured; and finally, the European Union should have a more important role in the political transition of Yemen.

From this debate, I gather first of all that we all share a common sense of urgency, and, at the same time, a strong commitment in the spirit of the Conclusions on Yemen that were adopted by the Foreign Affairs Council, aiming to step up the European Union’s role in assisting the warring parties to find, without delay, an urgent solution to the crisis, and of course to find ways to reach a peaceful agreement – not now, not tomorrow, but yesterday.  I conclude from our debate that EU engagement must be based on a comprehensive approach – this is High Representative Federica Mogherini’s approach, because she knows well all the implications in the region – while at the same time encompassing all our diplomatic tools and political commitment combined with our development assistance and of course continued delivery of the much needed humanitarian relief. I know well, as Commissioner for humanitarian aid, the major problems for humanitarian access. I would like to say here that we try hard to find new ways for humanitarian access to meet vulnerable people, but on the ground I have to admit that sometimes it is very difficult, and sometimes it is impossible.  Likewise, you have been clear in stating that Member States should fully support the EU in this common endeavour through their bilateral actions and initiatives. I would like to give you some details about our humanitarian assistance and development in more detail in terms of funding. My service, ECHO, has allocated EUR 70 million for 2016, for specific humanitarian projects in the humanitarian field alone. The total ECHO allocations since the beginning of the conflict is EUR 120 million. A new pledge of EUR 123 million was announced this year, as I said at the pledge conference in Geneva. Meanwhile, DEVCO has allocated EUR 52 million in 2015, and now we are preparing EUR 200 million for the period 2018-2020, focusing on resilience, stabilisation, health, and food security. I would like to close by signalling once again my appreciation for the role of this political body, Parliament, in keeping this often forgotten crisis on the international agenda. I remember that many times, in many international fora, when we tried to raise awareness about the Yemen crisis, sometimes as the European Union we were alone. So I am sure that your attention in particular to the Yemen crisis, in these conditions, in these circumstances, is quite important to maintain this crisis on the international agenda.

Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. –Madam President, these last three years since the Council adopted the Human Rights Guidelines on Freedom of Expression Online and Offline have been particularly difficult for journalists and bloggers all around the world. Press freedom and freedom of expression are under attack. In several parts of the world violations and abuses have become more frequent, even in democratic states and societies, including in our own region. The European Union will not accept this situation as the new normal. Over the years we have continued to support the freedom of journalists and bloggers with public statements or, where necessary, with quiet action behind the scenes. In recent weeks we have raised our voice on a number of specific cases, from Turkey to Egypt, from Mexico to Belarus, just to name a few.  Since the adoption of the Guidelines in May 2014, the Council Working Party on Human Rights (COHOM) has organised three discussions on implementation of the Guidelines. These exchanges constituted an opportunity to evaluate with Member States the general state of play of freedom of expression but also the actions taken by the EEAS, the Commission and Member States to implement the Guidelines. In addition to these regular exchanges, COHOM has also engaged with civil society on freedom of expression and media freedom. The latest exchange at COHOM took place last November with Member States and Commission services. It was an opportunity to discuss the state of play of our policies in support of freedom of expression. The European Union’s commitment to freedom of expression online and offline has been renewed in the new EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy (2015-2019), including its regular reporting on implementation. In practical terms, freedom of expression continues to be raised on a regular basis in human rights dialogues and the consultations with partner countries. I can mention Laos, Azerbaijan and Bangladesh as the most recent examples. Let me also emphasise that the EEAS and the Commission organise regular specific training sessions on freedom of expression for EU and Member States’ staff, including EU delegations, with the active participation of representatives of civil society. In addition the EEAS and the Commission have regular contact with relevant civil society organisations active on freedom of expression, in Brussels as well as in the context of human rights dialogues with third countries.  I would like to recall that civil society organisations were associated from the beginning with the drafting of the Guidelines and took part in the 2014 December NGO Human Rights Forum, dedicated to freedom of expression online and offline. This work has changed the lives of many journalists and bloggers. In some cases it has been a true life-saver. The European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, through its emergency support mechanism, provides protection to journalists both professional and non-professional. We counted more than 200 interventions since 2015 to support people threatened for their defence or practice of freedom of expression. Since January 2017, a new technical assistance programme, financed by the Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, assists EU delegations in the implementation of the Guidelines. Our aim is to build on best practices and enhance the capacity of EU delegations to work more intensely and creatively. Looking ahead, the Estonian Presidency of the Council has chosen freedom of expression as one of its human rights priorities. This will give COHOM the opportunity to further evaluate the implementation of the Guidelines, in close cooperation with Estonia. An informal COHOM will take place on 19-20 October 2017, including a discussion on the lessons learned from implementation of the Guidelines. This discussion will include different stakeholders, such as representatives of EU institutions, international organisations and civil society. Press freedom and freedom of expression are central to the European way of life and to whom we are. We Europeans will not get used to the violations. We will continue to act quietly or vocally, depending on the situation, for everyone’s rights to report, to criticise and to speak up.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 313, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Andrzej GRZYB", "mepid": "23785", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President!

The right to express one's opinion publicly is a fundamental human right and nothing can change that. Secondly, it is also the right to human dignity, because a person having the right to express himself is also respected in this respect. Free and diverse media are essential in any society to protect freedom of opinion, the right of expression and other human rights. Following the letter of the Treaty on European Union and the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it should be stated that the European Union reaffirms its determination to promote in its external policy this right that can and should be enjoyed by every individual. We recognize that both political and financial instruments - such as the EIDHR mentioned here - can help to break down violations of these rights in a consistent, timely and consistent manner.

The founder and financier of the Antena 3 trust, which includes several televisions, radios and newspapers, was sentenced to ten years in prison and declared a collaborator of the Securitate by the judges. Another example: Romania TV, whose owner was sued for three crimes, in three cases and fled the country. Digi24 television is being investigated for money laundering and tax evasion. Ziua newspaper had a criminal convict as its shareholder and, further, the list can go on. Basically, these people impose their personal agenda as a public agenda.

While hopes were high that democracy could go viral because of the open internet and new technologies, instead it seems that technology amplifies relations of power. Dictators are using sophisticated technologies to repress, while individuals are joining forces to make their voices heard. And the key question for us is how to make sure that the European Union stands with people who are facing repression, and how we can further facilitate the enjoyment of universal human rights – online and offline. It is more important than ever that we, in Europe, take the lead in advancing and defending the right to freedom of expression, access to information and the right to privacy. We can do this by coming to the defence of journalists or bloggers who are intimidated and silenced, by ensuring encryption is used widely to secure information, and by pushing back at the highest political level when websites are blocked or speech is silenced. The 2014 guidelines on freedom of expression online and offline were adopted after a clear push and demand from this House. It was a welcome step, but three years is like a century in light of the rapid technological developments that we see. If we want to continue to do what is needed, we have to stay up—to—date and up—to—speed. We must build on best practices and make key improvements, based on the lessons learned of the use of these guidelines. I have one specific question to the Commissioner: can he reflect on what is the status of the no-disconnect strategy?

The right to freedom of expression is violated in all regions of the world.

I was able to get a concrete picture of this on my recent trip to Singapore, Bangkok and Cambodia.

And whilst in the past that freedom of discourse might have been in the pub or in a public area, now, of course, it moves to the internet. The very concept of social media being clamped down on by the state – often using fear as the excuse – is completely against all concept of freedom, and I address this as well to the British Government, who have spoken very much about trying to clamp down on these things, using fear of terror as a reason.

Also ich kann Ihnen nur sagen: Ich weiß nicht, woher Sie die Annahme haben, dass Ägypten mehr Geld bekommt. Fakt ist, dass wir mit Ägypten sehr intensive Gespräche wegen der Menschenrechtssituation haben, wegen der Situation der Zivilgesellschaft. Es gibt eine spezielle Budgetlinie, die sich zusätzlich zu den üblichen Zahlungen an Ägypten mit der Unterstützung in Migrationsfragen beschäftigt. Das ist aber etwas, das Teil der generellen finanziellen Unterstützung nordafrikanischer Staaten ist. Umgekehrt kann ich berichten, dass es verschiedene Programme gibt, etwa OPEN Media Hub oder MedMedia-Programme. Das sind Programme, die auch dazu dienen, etwa in Ägypten unabhängigen Journalisten und media outlets zu helfen, ihrer Arbeit nachzukommen und sich auch persönlich professionell zu qualifizieren.

We remain committed to continuing to engage and work with the European Parliament on the implementation of this guideline.

I believe that we should scroll back one paragraph and focus on Article 49, which provides the legal basis for any European state to join the European Union. That said, the message of our debate tonight on the European Parliament’s report on Serbia should be clear: Serbia doesn’t only have a European perspective; Serbia has a European future. This country is clearly moving towards the European Union – so far, eight chapters have already been opened in the negotiation process, while two have already been provisionally closed. I strongly welcome that Commissioner Hahn – who I would once again like to thank for his outstanding commitment and engagement in the region – announced this week in Belgrade that two more chapters will be opened this month. There are three points which are of utmost importance on Serbia’s path towards the European Union that I would like to mention.  Firstly, the rule of law: I would like to use this opportunity to recall that Serbia’s progress on the rule of law Chapters 23 and 24 remains essential for the overall pace of the negotiation process. Judicial independence has to be assured in practice, because corruption and organised crime still remain an obstacle – not only to Serbia, but to all western Balkan countries’ democratic, social and economic development. On another point, I agree with the European Commission and the Council that, to guarantee unhindered exercise of the freedom of expression and media, shortcomings in this area should be addressed as a matter of priority.  Secondly, Serbia’s economy. The criteria for membership are intended to help Serbia to stand on its own feet and become fit for our common market and for the global economy in general. Serbia made progress with regards to the budget deficit and restructuring of publicly owned enterprises. The government in Belgrade is implementing an impressive economic and structural reforms agenda which has already yielded results in terms of growth prospects and the reduction of domestic and external imbalances. Moreover, this country has demonstrated its commitment to the EU connectivity agenda, which we aim to enhance further at the Trieste summit in July.  Thirdly, regional cooperation and good neighbourly relations: the government in Belgrade has made very important symbolic, but also substantial, steps to contribute to a better understanding and cooperation in the region. We all know that Serbia’s EU accession process is closely linked to the normalisation of relations with Kosovo. It is not only about concluding agreements; it is more about implementing them. As soon as Serbia has a new prime minister, and as soon as Kosovo has a stable government, both parties should continue to move forward with the full implementation of all the already reached agreements, and that in good faith and in a timely manner. Both sides, Pristina and Belgrade, should now take clear steps to show their commitment and credibility.  A final remark: I am convinced that this resolution is able to find the right balance between praising Serbia for adopting important reforms and pointing out what remains to be done. As we are having our political discourse, we should not forget that we are talking about changes that demand a lot from the Serbian citizens. I am well aware that this process goes far beyond the purely economic transformation – it is a truly social transformation – but I am convinced that this reform process is worth every effort.

As you know, the Western Balkans featured on the agenda of the European Council in March, where Member States reconfirmed the EU’s engagement with the region, including through deepening political and economic ties. The European Council discussions in March also clearly reaffirmed the unequivocal support for the European perspective on the Western Balkans. In this spirit the Presidency remains committed to advancing the enlargement process in full respect of the basic principles of conditionality and own merits. Serbia has made significant progress in 2016 and the accession negotiations have advanced at a steady pace. The rule of law chapters were opened in July 2016, enabling the EU and Serbia to engage closely on this decisive area. I am particularly happy to say that we have managed to keep the momentum in Serbia’s accession negotiations under the Maltese Presidency with an accession conference at ministerial level held on 27 February. On this occasion we were in a position to open Chapter 20 – Enterprise and Industrial Policy – as well as to open and provisionally close Chapter 26, Education and Culture. These chapters cover important economic and social aspects which are of interest to Serbia’s businesses, youth and citizens in general. Reforms strive to meet the expectations of the Serbian citizens and not only those of the EU. Work on further negotiating chapters is currently being finalised in the Council preparatory bodies. Once all Member States give their agreement, the Presidency stands ready to convene another accession conference next week. Progress in the accession negotiations is an acknowledgment of Serbia’s reform efforts, but it should also serve as an encouragement to the new Serbian Government, once in place, to remain committed to pursuing this reform path. Many areas requiring further reform efforts are rightly spelled out in your draft report. In this regard, let me again underline the particular importance we also attach to key areas such as the rule of law, fundamental rights, public administration reform and economic governance. The rule of law continues to be at the heart of the enlargement process. Serbia needs to continue to make progress under the rule of law chapters opened last July, guided by the respective action plans and interim benchmarks. To this end, Serbia should intensify reform efforts and focus on effective implementation, which can make a significant contribution to the good results produced by Serbia’s economic reforms. In the area of fundamental rights, Serbia needs to address shortcomings in the freedom of expression as a matter of priority and ensure respect and protection of minorities. Likewise, the normalisation of relations with Kosovo will also remain essential for the overall pace of the negotiations, especially the further implementation of agreements reached within the Belgrade-Pristina dialogue. In this context, Serbia’s commitment to remaining constructively engaged in the dialogue and to continuously work on a further normalisation of relations needs to be acknowledged. Important steps in the dialogue, such as Serbia’s implementation of the telecommunications agreement and the resumption of works on the Mitrovica bridge, should serve as an encouragement to take the process forward. We look forward to the continued engagement of all involved and urge Serbia to swiftly implement in good faith its part of all past agreements. In the area of regional cooperation we welcome Serbia’s constructive engagement and encourage it to continue its efforts to strengthen good neighbourly relations as well as to remain committed to preserving peace and stability in the region. Full cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia remains essential. On various occasions the Council has also reiterated its call on Serbia to progressively align with the EU common foreign and security policy, including on restrictive measures in the period up to accession. Let me again underline the growing importance of further deepening cooperation on foreign policy issues. I will conclude by again welcoming the continued progress in Serbia’s EU accession negotiations and the continued good cooperation with the EU and with the region. Let me also recall our appreciation for the constructive contribution of the European Parliament, and in particular of your rapporteur, David McAllister, to advance Serbia’s accession process to the EU.

This is a balanced and accurate assessment of Serbia’s focus on its path to the European Union. From our point of view, it is overall in line with the findings of our own report of November 2016 and the Commission’s assessment since then.  I share your view that Serbia has made good progress towards EU membership, which remains Serbia’s strategic objective. This has been repeatedly outlined by the Serbian authorities and President Vučić. Serbia’s ambitious economic and structural reform agenda is already delivering results. Serbia has shown its commitment to peace and stability in the region: good neighbourly relations, regional cooperation and the continuation of the dialogue with Pristina. This is encouraging for the Western Balkans connectivity agenda and the next Trieste summit in July. Serbia has also made progress in the reform of its public administration, and has started implementing its ambitious action plans on the rule of law, and Serbia is indeed to be commended for its efforts to address the refugee and migration crisis, which continued EU support. This hard work has paid off with eight chapters opened now, two provisionally closed, and a number of other chapters being prepared for opening. Serbia should now build on its progress and move decisively ahead with reforms, in particular on the rule of law and the protection of the most vulnerable groups and minorities. It is equally important that Serbia continues playing its part in the normalisation of its relations with Kosovo.  Together with you, I regret that some developments have not been of help in this direction, and I look forward to the resumption of the dialogue. I am also encouraged by President Vučić’s willingness to launch a domestic dialogue on Kosovo. I also share your views that strategic communication to ensure public support and understanding of the benefits and obligations of EU accession is of key importance for EU supporters in Serbia. The EU is Serbia’s number one partner, including on assistance – EUR 2 billion in grants since 2007, and way ahead of any other global partners – and this deserves to be known. From our side, we are making every effort to strengthen our public diplomacy, and I was in Serbia only last weekend with that in mind. I can only encourage you to support our efforts in this direction.  Now that the Serbian presidential elections are behind us, I am confident that all energy in Serbia will be devoted to the implementation of the reform agenda.

Of course, Serbia still has a long way to go, starting with the promotion of serious debates about the Union, its institutions and the implications of accession.

Then, Serbia must continue to progressively align its foreign policy with that of the Union, especially with regard to Russia, where there is a lot of work to be done.

Negotiation chapters are being opened and closed and just yesterday, as we heard, Commissioner Hahn has announced the opening of new chapters later this month. On paper and in the report in front of us, the development in Serbia seems pretty much business as usual. But what I hear when I talk to Serbian citizens shows the contrary. Young Serbs tell me that it is almost impossible to get a job without a party membership card or paying a certain amount of the money to a party official, and NGO reports show continuous decline in the rule of law and unresolved cases such as Savamala prove this in practice. Media representatives are threatened, investigative journalists are turned away and some of them are even physically attacked. I ask myself, and you: is this the Serbia which we want as part of our European family? Is this what we want to achieve with negotiating chapters 23 and 24? I am afraid not. Serbia should do much more to reach our European standards of democracy, rule of law and the respect for human rights. I am sure that if we continue to practice constructive criticism and turn a blind eye to the real state of play, we will once again prove that we are doing something wrong. As an important player in the region, I wish for Serbia to develop into a prosperous, economically and socially stable country where democracy is a way of living not a word on paper, where rules, as opposed to the interests of those who hold power in their hands, prevail.

On the critical side, the tendency of occasional aggravation - especially verbal - of relations with neighbors in the region, tactics between pro-European and pro-Russian orientation, cannot be overlooked. In doing so, given that the country declares its neutrality, participation in the military maneuvers of Russia and its close allies is questionable. When it comes to the media in Serbia, it is considered that appropriate legislation is not enough if in practice political control and pressure on the media, reduction of the media to the role of propagandists of the ruling parties and personalities are allowed. Policy interference in the judiciary will also need to be eliminated on the way to a credible state of law.

For centuries, Serbs faced attacks from the Turks and efforts to destroy independence. Even Austria-Hungary was not interested in good neighborly relations. Yugoslavia has become an attempt to promote the peaceful coexistence and development of all intertwined nations in the Balkans. The bloody retaliation that the Serbs received in the early 1990s, followed by the secession of parts and, most recently, the unlawful establishment of the State of Kosovo, shows an effort to break up the entire central part of the Balkans into the smallest possible units. The drastic bombing has shown that NATO has not been and will never be a guarantor of peace. The hypocrisy of EU leaders is shown, inter alia, in paragraphs 24 and 30 of this report. How can those who do not see the trampling of minority rights in many EU countries dare to call on Serbia to discuss minority protection legislation thoroughly? Another example is the call for the Serbian authorities to support constitutional reforms in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The culmination of these demands, incidentally formulated by the same forces that canceled Bulgaria's and Serbia's plan to build the Southstream gas pipeline, is the emphasis on \"Serbia needs to develop its gas and electricity interconnections with neighboring countries.\" It is no wonder that, as a result of these and other steps by the European Commission, which is trying to interfere in Serbia's internal affairs, I consider this report to be one of the highlights of hypocrisy in the Balkans' EU integration process to date.

Stability in the Western Balkans is important, but we should not sacrifice our values for stability: both have to go hand in hand when negotiating.

Serbia must give up its natural role as a bridge between Russia and Europe and it must follow a European Union on the brink of the abyss, a Union which is - excuse me for the ridiculous - applauding the entry of Montenegro .

I am glad that the presidential elections, which took place in April, were peaceful, and I believe that the new president will continue Serbia's pro-European direction. Serbia is making progress in the integration process. The opening of new chapters is a clear signal that the country is well prepared for accession negotiations. It should be recalled that in key areas such as the rule of law, the independence of the judiciary and the fight against corruption, Serbia should show greater political will to address pressing issues. These are mainly Chapters 23 and 24, where we expect a clear political signal, reforms and a decisive solution. We are also increasingly receiving information on the persisting problems of media freedom, attacks on journalists, as well as problems relating to civil liberties and the shrinking space for civil society. Although this trend is evident in all the countries of the region, let us not hide it, we should be very sensitive to these issues and draw attention to them clearly. Only in this way can we deepen the confidence of Serbian society in European values. Finally, I would like to encourage Serbian politicians to pursue a responsible and constructive policy in the region. Serbia, as one of the regional leaders, has a responsibility for the stability and development of the whole region.

However, in many areas this year we are witnessing a lack of progress, even worsening, despite changes in legislation. First of all, the freedom of the media in Serbia is endangered today, the fight against corruption and organized crime is insufficiently effective, the necessary strengthening of the rule of law is not recorded, as well as the implementation of the recently adopted action plan on respect for minority and human rights. in The Hague and better alignment with European Union foreign policy. All this is part of the \"to do\" list that Serbia should shorten. In addition, it would be incomplete to talk about influential events in Serbia, not to mention the recent protests of mostly young people after the presidential election. The reasons for their dissatisfaction are a cause for concern. They claim that the election results brought only a formal change of functions. Adequate contribution to better relations with neighbors and resolving remaining bilateral issues, such as determining the fate of the missing or succession, is also extremely important in the process of Serbia's progress.

The European Union has a key role to play in maintaining and consolidating the peace and stability created by the war in the Balkans following the break-up of the former Yugoslavia. For the countries of the Western Balkans, European integration is the way to unfold and for the future. That is why the Union must not leave them alone in their multifaceted crisis. Aware of this, the European Union must provide these countries with a realistic opportunity to join as soon as possible, but those who have embarked on integration must make a much greater effort to meet the demands placed on them and their own commitments. Serbia appears to be on track to meet these requirements. With regard to the findings and shortcomings in the Serbian country report, this time I will focus exclusively on the issue of ethnic minorities. I miss in the report the explicit wording of minority autonomy and, in this connection, the fact that the adoption of laws on national councils and the rights of national minorities is being postponed. The document also fails to demand the return of minority community-church assets. It is also unsustainable that the provisions of the otherwise laudable legislation on the protection of minorities usually remain on paper, and their implementation is notoriously delayed.

This year, it will be 22 years since the conclusion of the Dayton Agreement, and 18 years since the end of the Kosovo war. This report, which presents the tasks for Serbia at the time and present in a very good manner, both the progress and what is ahead of Serbia in terms of membership negotiations, builds a certain - so to speak - optimism. President Buzek once said that we managed to prevent the return of conflicts in the Western Balkans in a surprising and simple way, because the countries of the region had lined up to join the European Union. That was an important statement, but at the same time it is not enough: we too have to make a lot of efforts. It is a value that the Union - and we must remember it - has this attraction. Of course, there are many criticizing voices that undermine the value of the Union, but I think it is worth recalling it when talking about Serbia during this debate. The report should not only be an incentive for the Serbian government, but above all it should also be a kind of encouragement for the citizens of Serbia that it is worth continuing the reforms that are sometimes difficult and sometimes even incomprehensible at a given stage. It seems that, for example, the indication by Commissioner Hahn that we have donated more than two billion euros to support these processes is worth noting. There has been a lot of progress in the area of ​​economy and democratization, and new chapters have also been opened - but we also know that there are many changes needed in the field of human rights, media freedom, the judiciary, or recommendations regarding, for example, changes to some constitutional provisions. I would also like to emphasize the important role that ombudsmen can play.

It is not a sacrifice, it is a step forward anyway. I think we need to understand that when some people talk about the costs of enlargement, the policy of enlargement has been one of the main success stories for the European Union.

In any case, the shortcomings are still visible. More efforts are needed to fight corruption and organized crime, which remain an obstacle to economic and social development, but media freedom is also threatened. We keep repeating that it is necessary to normalize relations with Kosovo, where greater involvement of Serbia is expected, and in addition, it is very important that Serbia aligns its foreign and security policy with the policy of the European Union. I am thinking here in particular of their relationship with Russia. As far as good neighborly relations are concerned, bilateral issues related to other countries, especially Croatia, must be resolved as soon as possible. They need to be addressed urgently so that regional co-operation is possible and so that Serbia can continue to build its European future. Serbia simply needs to adjust its foreign policy to European policy, deepen dialogue with Kosovo and step up efforts to resolve all remaining bilateral issues. I agree with Mr. Hökmark that we need to discuss and that it is much better to allow Serbia to open a chapter and thus get closer to the Union, than to prevent it.

In addition to meeting the criteria important for membership in the European Union, it is necessary to resolve open bilateral disputes with neighboring countries, first of all I mean resolving disputes with the Republic of Croatia. The issue of missing persons during the war, the opening of archives, the resolution of border issues and the issue of Serbia's regional jurisdiction are some of the open issues that need to be resolved. I would especially like to address the issues of education in the mother tongue of the Croatian national minority in Serbia and the provision of textbooks in the Croatian language and content that will be adapted to them.

The enlargement process of the European Union is also one of the greatest successes for me, we also know that those who now speak most from Slovenia, Croatia, who are part of this enlargement process. An orderly democracy needs a political culture, it needs respect for the law, it needs the fight against corruption, it also needs media freedom. This is also being done by countries that are already members of the European Union, and if this is not the case in countries, it is still a problem in countries. Therefore, I think it is right that these warnings contained in the reports have been accepted in good faith and that these errors should be corrected. Certainly, there is a lot of good in the report on Serbia, first of all economic progress, the reforms that are being implemented, because that is the answer to the fact that the demographic picture in Serbia will improve, because what we are recording now is that I don't know births per year, 105,000 dead, speaks to the poor situation in the country.

A stabilisation and association agreement finally has come into force, and that has included the European reform agenda and something we voted recently in the plenary: the participation of Kosovo in EU programmes. So various things were re-signalled – and that is supported by this report – strongly signalled to Kosovo, and to Kosovo citizens: your future is in the European Union. Nevertheless, we also have to see that, over the last year, things have not progressed as much as Kosovo citizens and also as we here in the European Parliament would have liked them to go. The extreme polarisation of the political landscape (and I will come to the elections of last Sunday at the end), but also no progress here in the European Union. We still – and I have been rapporteur for Kosovo since 2009 – do not have progress with five EU Member States recognising the independence of the Republic of Kosovo. This is harming progress also. This does not give Kosovo citizens the idea that we really want them and that they are part of Europe – they should be part of the European Union. So this report also regrets that still five Members are not recognising Kosovo, and you know, to those of you who come from those five Member States, sometimes I wonder, when you then criticise corruption – organised crime in Kosovo, yes, which exists, like in other parts of the region and also inside the EU – then why do you not want to allow Kosovo to become part of Europol and Interpol? Because that would help. So there is a contradiction in the position of those five Member States, and I hope we will see progress in the next year. But let me come to some other points. In the normalisation process between Kosovo and Serbia we also have had mostly stalemates. We have had one progress: Kosovo now has a telephone code of its own and not any more the Monaco one or the Slovenian one. It can be still be used, but there is this independent international telephone code. But nevertheless, so many things have been agreed between the two governments of Kosovo and Serbia, but implementation is still lacking on both sides. Also from Serbia we have had signs that were simply not helpful. The Serbian nationalist train from Belgrade to northern Kosovo with signs on it: ‘Kosovo is Serbia’. This simply is not the reality any more, and people in Serbia know that and the Serbian Government knows it. It simply does not help to develop good neighbourly relationships if things like that are supported. And as I said, what is lacking really is implementation. In Kosovo itself, still administration of justice remain slow and inefficient. Lack of progress has been made in regard to the protection of freedom of expression and media freedom, and several other issues. When I talk about gender-based violence, still women’s full rights need to be enjoyed, although there has been some progress as well. Now let me come to the elections on that weekend. Yes, finally, and it is good that these elections were passed peacefully. There have not been any disruptions. But we still have problems there. There are still voting lists that were not been totally accurate; the electoral system still not functioning well sometimes and financing of political parties were problems. So I think it would be very important also because we have had intimidation against Kosovo Serbs who would not want to vote for the Socijalistička. There I would like to end with asking, as it is said in the report as well, that the leaders of the Kosovo Serb community should take full ownership of them being part of Kosovo and not always referring to Belgrade.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 370, "date": "2017-06-13.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, on 9 March 2017, the European Council discussed the situation in the Western Balkans. The heads of state or government stressed the EU’s commitment to the region and reaffirmed their unequivocal support for the European perspective of the Western Balkans, in full respect of the basic principles of conditionality and own merits.  Today we focus on Kosovo’s progress in 2016. However, more generally, I would like to stress the importance of Kosovo’s stability and of its continuous efforts to advance further on the European path. We welcome the entry into force of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement (SAA) with Kosovo and the first Stabilisation and Association Council, which both took place last year. The EU-only agreement, which is without prejudice to Member States’ positions on status, provides the contractual framework for cooperation between the EU and Kosovo.  It is important for Kosovo to implement the comprehensive reforms to meet its obligations under the SAA in order to fully benefit from the opportunities it brings. We welcome the launch of the European Reform Agenda in November 2016. The Kosovo leadership is responsible for ensuring its thorough implementation, with the objective of improving the rule of law, socio-economic development and building a track record of SAA implementation.  It is key that Kosovo further intensifies its efforts to improve the rule of law, including judicial independence. It also needs to further advance its fight against organised crime and corruption. We welcome the steps taken to increase the number of high-level corruption and organised crime cases being investigated and prosecuted. We encourage further progress in strengthening a solid track record of convictions. We also note progress in fighting radicalisation, extremism and terrorism, and we encourage further efforts.  Effective promotion and protection of human rights throughout Kosovo should be pursued, including the full protection of cultural and religious heritage. Furthermore, the Kosovo authorities should address the inclusion and protection of persons belonging to minorities. This includes additional efforts to ensure a safe environment and the safeguarding of their property rights, as well as the strengthening of social cohesion. Progress in the process of normalisation of relations with Serbia is essential and underpins the development of relations and cooperation between the EU and Kosovo. We urge Kosovo to swiftly implement in good faith its part of all past agreements achieved in the EU—facilitated dialogue, in particular the establishment of the Association/Community of Serb—majority Municipalities, and to engage constructively with Serbia in formulating and implementing future agreements. We concur with you in welcoming the recent agreements on the implementation of freedom of movement and telecoms. We look forward to a swift appointment of judicial personnel into the Kosovo system in order to ensure the functioning of an integrated judiciary. We also look forward to the opening of the Mitrovica Bridge, as agreed between the two sides.  The Council will continue to monitor closely Kosovo’s continued engagement towards visible and sustainable progress so that Kosovo and Serbia can continue on their respective European paths. Neither should block the other in these efforts, and both should be able to fully exercise their rights and fulfil their responsibilities. The High Representative played a key role in promoting additional progress in the dialogue. We also welcome the agreement reached over the extension of the EULEX mission until June 2018. We urge Kosovo to continue to cooperate closely and effectively with EULEX, and to contribute actively to the full and unhindered execution by EULEX of its mandate. We welcome the fact that Kosovo met its remaining obligation on the establishment of the Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor’s Office to investigate allegations of international crimes committed during and after the 1999 conflict. All authorities in Kosovo should comply with their requests for assistance. Kosovo has made significant progress in meeting the requirements of its visa roadmap, which led to a proposal by the Commission, in May 2016, to transfer Kosovo to the Schengen visa-free list. As rightly noted in your resolution, such a decision can only be taken if Kosovo meets the two remaining requirements: the ratification of the border/boundary agreement with Montenegro, and the continuation of the strengthening of its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption.  We share your concern about the incidents of violence in the Assembly throughout 2016. It is important that, following early general elections, all political parties and local stakeholders show responsibility and ownership and engage in a constructive dialogue with parliament, as the key forum for political debate.  Finally, we very much welcome the signature of the Framework Agreement on the general principles for the participation of Kosovo in Union programmes. It is of utmost importance for Kosovo to take full advantage of these programmes. We are looking forward to the European Parliament’s consent for the conclusion of this agreement.

However, we do share chief election observer Peterle’s concerns about several aspects of the elections. Any incidents of intimidation and pressure as witnessed during the electoral campaign are unacceptable. It will be essential for Kosovo’s democratic development that the findings of the observation mission are taken seriously and implemented as a matter of priority. Now that elections are over, Kosovo has no time to lose. Based on the democratic will of the people, we expect a new government to be formed and begin work without delay. A new governing coalition will face huge expectations and challenges. The dialogue with Belgrade needs to move ahead. The people of Kosovo expect decisions on visa liberalisation. The rule of law, economic development and education need to be given the highest priority. Broad societal consensus on the EU reforms will be necessary to navigate through these various challenges. One of the most important priorities the government will have to tackle immediately is delivery on the conditions for visa liberalisation. Kosovo has made progress on its track record of high-level corruption and organised crime cases. This must be a continuous process and one in which momentum must be maintained at all times. I can assure you that we know how contentious the border demarcation agreement with Montenegro has become. It will now be for Kosovo’s new government and parliament to deliver on the expectations of its people. We are ready to support Kosovo every step of the way. Once Kosovo has fulfilled these conditions, the Commission will give its green light to the European Parliament and Council. Beside these political challenges, Kosovo’s priorities should remain the rule of law, economic development and education. Kosovo needs to become an attractive place for business, provide citizens with high quality education and reduce the very high unemployment levels, in particular amongst young people. The incoming government will need to show strong commitment to addressing the systemic weaknesses in the rule of law, as we have frequently pointed out in our reports. The Commission is providing strong support for the implementation of these priorities through substantive financial assistance and technical advice. For its part, Kosovo needs to keep pace with the rest of the region, to promote economic growth and foster political stability, which is essential for the security of the Western Balkans as a whole. To achieve this, we have jointly agreed programmes with Kosovo: the European Reform Agenda and the Economic Reform Programme. These should serve as guidelines for concrete deliverables.

We hope that the issues which have been troubling domestic Kosovar politics will be settled through a determined government and a responsible and Europe-oriented political assembly.

This report, in addition to describing the situation of our relations, is above all useful in focusing our attention on the various crucial points that still prevent Kosovo from fully integrating. The result of last Sunday's important elections saw the so-called war wing, as the local media call it, made up of a coalition led by Haradinaj, getting the most votes, which would not seem sufficient to support a government without alliances with others. political forces. Our expectations are naturally those of seeing the birth of a government that guarantees the country the stability necessary to continue the process of political stabilization and integration of Kosovo in the European context. However, we must be aware that Haradinaj's victory will not simplify relations with Serbia, a country which, as we know, has issued an international arrest warrant against the former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army. The role of the European Union in this context will be important. As rightly pointed out in the report, concern remains high regarding corruption and organized crime, two factors that afflict the country with a certain severity. Furthermore, despite the appreciable economic improvement and the increase in tax revenues, it is essential to promote structural economic and social reforms, especially as regards work and education. Finally, I invite you to reflect on the fact that the lack of recognition of Kosovo by five Member States actually hinders the integration process. A change of course could be useful and would allow the improvement of relations between Kosovo and Serbia.

Of course, as in other pre-accession countries, there are problems in the judiciary, high corruption, organized crime, media independence, and the huge issue with Islamic fundamentalists. But I would like to draw your attention to the fact that Kosovo is also facing the interests and influences of neighboring countries, such as Russia and Serbia, which are trying to develop their influence in this territory. Turkey is conquering the country religiously and economically, and thus we are left with only the opportunity to be donors of funds, with no visible political benefit.

Low citizen participation makes quality policies difficult, but so is the danger of losing confidence in the European Union.

First of all, I would like to say a warm word of thanks to Ulrike Lunacek for her dedicated work. I think we should recognize that this country has managed to hold the third elections since independence in 2008, once again freely and fairly. However, the result must not lead to a political blockade. And that worries me, given the election result and the composition of Parliament. The formation of a government in Pristina nine months in advance, as was the case after the last parliamentary election, should be avoided. The new government in Pristina should be pro-European in the interests of all Kosovars and have a resilient strategy for the future of the country. In my opinion, particular progress is necessary in three areas. Firstly - it has already been emphasized: Kosovo is the only country in the Western Balkans that still does not enjoy a visa-free regime. This of course leads to frustration among people. The new government in Pristina and parliament should finally meet the criteria for visa-free travel. First and foremost, this includes the ratification of the border agreement with Montenegro. Second, the new government should adopt major economic reforms as well as reforms to strengthen the rule of law. The progress made in the fight against corruption, bribery and organized crime are of course logical and important prerequisites on the way to the European Union, but they are also the basic prerequisite for further investments from other countries, for example from Germany. Third: The dialogue with Serbia should be continued and deepened; agreements already made must be implemented.

The adoption of this Resolution was postponed due to the calling of early parliamentary elections, which speaks of the political dynamics in the youngest European country. Kosovo is a clear example of a post-conflict society where key protagonists fail to resolve accumulated points of conflict. Last year, even in important institutions of the democratic order, such as the Parliament, political polarization could have a violent character. The situation in Kosovo is greatly affected by poor social and economic conditions, in particular high youth unemployment, the weakness of the judicial system subject to political pressure, pressure on the media and the insufficiently effective fight against organized crime and corruption. However, all these burdens can be removed over time if the Kosovo authorities actively use the possibilities of the Stabilization and Association Agreement and meet the obligations of the European Reform Agenda. Kosovo's European future will be determined by the attitude of politics, but also of society as a whole, according to the events of the recent past, which will be dealt with by the Hague Office of the Special Investigator for war crimes committed during the aggression on Kosovo. Authorities in Pristina also face the challenge of continuing talks with Belgrade more productively. Both negotiating parties must overcome mutual animosities as well as internal resistance to a process that actually has no alternative. That is, it is better not to think about it. As President of the Joint Parliamentary Delegation with Kosovo, I would like to emphasize that the political divisions have not affected our work. Moreover, all members of the delegation gave their full contribution and we adopted the joint recommendations without much difficulty. On this basis, I allow myself the hope that the conditions for the abolition of visas for the citizens of Kosovo will be met and that we in the European Parliament will finally ratify the decision on their free movement.

Kosovo’s path to the EU is to be welcomed, but problems need also be mentioned. The reason for the snap elections was said to be governmental inability to make reforms in Kosovo. However, none of the questions that caused stalemate were put to the voters to decide, so there is a risk that we will see a replay of this situation. This deadlock, which is actually Kosovo’s biggest problem, is indeed caused by the difficult government coalitions and the unwillingness of some parties to put Kosovo’s best interests before those of the party, a simple unwillingness to cooperate if that will cost them voters. This is not unusual for young traditional democracies, but I still believe that we have to demand from whoever forms the government speedy reforms, primarily on the fight against corruption.

In other words, there is still corruption, there is still no full rule of law, and so on and so forth. We have got used to a language that, as far as the real circumstances in these countries are concerned, cannot be surpassed in terms of beauty, and then you can understand that some people lose their patience with what is going on.

Visa facilitations can only be granted if the conditions are met.

I hope you will learn your lessons from it and understand that democracy also means finding compromises and not thinking and acting in black and white categories. I can only assure you: the European Commission is committed to the European perspective of Kosovo. We are doing everything, and last year too, we delivered, not only the Stabilization and Association Agreement, but also the European reform agenda. It is now really up to the authorities in the country to take advantage of these opportunities. The citizens of Kosovo want that. 75% percent - a whopping three-quarters majority - are in favor of European integration. When it comes to visa liberalization, it is up to those responsible to deliver. It is not up to the European Union or others here to bring about the results, the decisions. It's an internal problem.

Let me also address the few – I think hardly any of them are still here – who have been very critical of Kosovo. These are the non-recognisers and those from the far left and the far right. First of all, there was a verdict from the International Court of Justice in 2010, which said that the unilateral declaration of independence was in accordance with international law, and this was confirmed by the UN General Assembly. So stop saying that this is against international law. Secondly, you will not be able to turn back history. The Republic of Kosovo exists and is recognised by 114 UN Member States. We will all continue to struggle to make Kosovo part of that European Union in a very positive way. Turning back to what now has to be done in Kosovo, a new government has to be formed, and I hope this will happen swiftly. We cannot wait another nine months as happened last time. This is because of Kosovo’s citizens: they will not do it for us. It is not for us here in the Parliament or for the European Union that a government should be formed; it is for delivering on the promises that the candidates have made to the people, and it is for delivering what people expect: for example, visa liberalisation. It is sure that the new Assembly now has to ratify, as swiftly as possible, the border demarcation with Montenegro – there is no way around that – and deliver on the track record of convictions against organised crime and corruption. That has to be done by the government. Without that, progress will not be possible and citizens will not believe that there is a new government that is theirs. That is important.
