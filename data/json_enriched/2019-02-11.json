It is a concept of dignity, strength and pride of an entire people, the Sardinian people, serious, straight, which cannot be treated in this way. Mr President, I believe that the industrialists and multinationals of large-scale distribution cannot, either in Sardinia or in all regions of Europe, fulfill the condition of imposing their diktats in order to starve an entire producing people.

I recall that the private conversations of the German Chancellor, Mrs Merkel, were spied on, like those of the President of the French Republic.

Firstly, to protect the financial interests of the European Union and, secondly, to promote cooperation and administrative assistance between Member States, and between Member States and the Commission, in the field of customs application and in the field of the fight and application of agricultural rules. This programme is part of the continuity of the Hercules III programme and has been adapted in its financial amount – I hope the Commission can be satisfied – in the context of the current financial perspectives. In this sense, this Programme incorporates two fundamental systems. One of the systems refers to anti-fraud reporting mechanisms, which summarizes the Commission's customs applications, and the other to the administrative complaint correction mechanism with which the Commission assists third countries. It is important to note that this Regulation will enter into force on the first of January 2021 and will not entail an overlap with other programmes in the European Union and, above all, with other programmes which are manifested in the field of combating fraud. I am referring to the OLAF Regulation, I am referring to the Regulation setting up the European Public Prosecutor's Office and I am also referring to the Directive in the field of combating fraud. It is important to stress that the Regulation determines the practical assumptions in which it will be applied — its scope — to avoid these duplications and, at the same time, that the co-financing margin will be a margin of 80%, except in duly justified cases where there are actually financial interests of the European Union that may be affected, in which case the margin may be increased to 90%. I would like to say, Mr President, that, apart from these two objectives, the report we are presenting and the draft Regulation have three other specific objectives which are to prevent and combat fraud, corruption and any other illegal activity affecting the financial interests of the European Union, to support the notification of irregularities, including fraud, with respect to shared management funds and pre-accession assistance funds in the European Union budget , and provide tools for the exchange of information and support for operational activities in the field of mutual administrative assistance. Moreover, with this programme, Parliament considers that it would be very useful if those entities of countries which are united with the Union under partnership agreements could participate in this area of customs cooperation. We have introduced a number of aspects relating to the evaluation, monitoring and control of the Anti-Fraud Programme. We have envisaged that a description of the actions to be financed under this Programme, an indication of the amount allocated, the maximum co-financing rate of subsidies and, in some way, also the obligation to introduce, as already envisaged in the draft Regulation, a report made for the European Parliament and the Council, and a final assessment after the three years. With these initiatives, Mr President, we have somehow wanted to respond to some of the concerns raised by the Court of Auditors in this area. And I would like, in order to conclude this speech, to thank the shadow rapporteurs who have dealt with this report and also the services of the House.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 37, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA", "mepid": "2002", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, Mr Salafranca, as rapporteur, honourable Members, I am replacing Commissioner Oettinger today, and I am grateful that I can participate in this debate on the proposal for a regulation establishing the EU Anti-Fraud Programme. The Commission and Parliament agree on the paramount importance of protecting the EU financial interests from fraud, corruption and irregularities. These must be effectively and efficiently prevented, detected and tackled at EU and Member State level. The EU institutions have deployed significant efforts to fight against fraud in recent years, for example with the adoption of the new Directive on the protection of the EU financial interests through criminal law (PIF Directive) and the establishment of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. The proposed EU Anti-Fraud Programme, despite its relatively small size, fits perfectly into this picture. It combines the longstanding Hercule programme, which has successfully supported the fight against fraud since 2004, with two long-established operational activities performed by the Commission (OLAF – the European Anti-Fraud Office) in the anti-fraud area. The first is the Anti-Fraud Information System, a set of IT tools supporting Member States’ customs authorities in mutual administrative assistance between national authorities and the Commission. The second is the irregularity management system that provides an IT platform for the Member States to report fraud and irregularities affecting the EU budget. The main novelty of the EU Anti-Fraud Programme is to combine these three strands of work, on a single legal basis, in order to provide for synergies and flexibility among them. The Commission wishes to thank Mr Salafranca for his report, which acknowledges the importance and the relevance of the proposal. The Commission takes note of the report’s proposal significantly to increase the financial envelope for the programme, and we interpret that as recognition of the success of the current programme. The amount for the programme will need to be discussed further in the context of the general negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). The Commission has chosen to table light-touch basic acts for its proposals for spending programmes in the next MFF cycle in order to achieve a high degree of flexibility, thus allowing the programmes to adapt better to new and unforeseen needs during the seven years of the next MFF. This is why the Commission has chosen, for instance, not to set up co-financing rates for grants in the proposal itself, or to fix only indicative amounts for each of the three pillars of the programme. We ask you to consider carefully the amendments that would deprive the future programme of these elements of flexibility, in particular at a time when there are significant developments in the anti-fraud area, such as the creation of the European Public Prosecutor, which might call for adaptation over time of the activities that the programme supports. This applies also to the adoption of the work programmes, which will become the main tool for programme delivery. These are mere acts of implementation, which do not amend or supplement the legal framework and therefore do not need to be adopted by means of delegated acts. I am confident that the next phase of the procedure will bring Parliament, the Council and the Commission together in a common effort to deliver a new legal act constituting the basis for a modern, flexible, reliable and effective instrument to fight fraud against the EU budget. The Commission wishes to stress that we very much appreciate Parliament’s interest in discussing the results of the Hercule Programme every year. We hope that it will continue this dialogue on the new Anti-Fraud Programme.

Today we are dealing with a small but fine programme of only EUR 181 million over seven years. In other words, we cannot have high hopes that we will achieve a great deal there. And, Commissioner, flexibility or not – I do not want 'Hercule' to become a travel programme for all those who work in the fight against fraud and want to exchange occasional exchanges. We are in danger. Personally, I consider the unproposed levels of co-financing to be a mistake. So thank you for writing this in. I believe that we must send out a signal as to how much the European Union is prepared to give the Member States to comply with the European legal framework, the common commitment of what needs to be done at the external border, for example in the customs area. Commissioner! I would like to point out straight away that the Committee on Budgetary Control has dealt at length with what has actually become of the hardware financed in the past. And here it can be said that we are not very good at this long-term monitoring of this hardware – whether the scanners that the EU has purchased for the Member States against tobacco smuggling are ready for use. In other words, it would be beneficial if the Commission had a greater interest in this issue than it has had in the past. I believe that the amendments that have been tabled, namely that we are trying to avoid duplication and to combat the lack of synergies in promoting similar or similar measures, that we need clear added value for this programme and that we need co-financing rates, that the monitoring role of the European Parliament has been strengthened: these are very important things to give this programme efficiency and credibility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 39, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Inés AYALA SENDER", "mepid": "28292", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, I too would like to thank Mr Salafranca, with whom we have worked very well, for his report, and also to thank him for specifying some of the aspects which we think are fundamental from the point of view of budgetary control.

Unfortunately, it is not always the case. It is time and again to stress that EU funding is not a gift, but an investment. If the fight against fraud does not work, then, as I said, that is very regrettable, and unfortunately it is the case with some Member States. It really is time for the Member States to exchange ideas better, to learn from each other and also to make use of the new technological and digital opportunities that we now have.  80% of the EU budget – EUR 125.6 billion in 2017 – is spent by the countries.

The public authorities have just reported one fraud case, private bodies 18.  If you look at these figures, I am actually very much in favour and enthusiastic that we have finally set up such a programme, and we must implement it, and for that we urgently need the support of the Member States.

They are clear evidence of the continued support of the Parliament for the fight against fraud and the protection of the EU’s financial interests.  With regard to overlaps with other EU programmes, this programme is the only one specifically supporting the fight against fraud to the EU budget and, as such, does not overlap with the scope of any other programmes such as in the areas of justice and home affairs and customs. In addition, the periodical preparation of the work programmes, through appropriate inter—service consultations, will provide ample opportunity to explore synergies and detect possible overlaps. Furthermore, the Anti-Fraud Programme pursues a different objective from the customs control equipment instrument. The Anti-Fraud Programme specifically aims at the protection of the EU financial interests and therefore covers not only the revenue side, but also the expenditure side through a range of activities, of which financing the acquisition of equipment is only one aspect.  The Commission will ensure that there is no duplication between the programmes during the implementation phase, in particular when establishing the work programmes, which will be done in close consultation with the other Commission services concerned. As regards co—financing rates, the financial regulation no longer requires that co—financing rates are defined in the basic acts. Therefore, the proposal does not fix such rates, in order to provide the programme with the maximum flexibility. This is a horizontal issue across proposals. All your remarks and the amendments that you decide to put forward in the vote tomorrow will be carefully considered for discussion during the next phase of the procedure. Some of them touch cross-cutting issues common to all proposals for spending programmes and will be part of the general negotiations for the next MFF.  The Commission remains fully committed to ensuring that the EU anti-fraud strategy is supported by a modern and flexible financial instrument capable of facing, promptly and effectively, the challenges of future years. In this vein, we look forward to supporting the negotiations between Parliament and the Council with a constructive and cooperative spirit.

Mr President, the Common Fisheries Policy, revised in 2013, has introduced a new method of fisheries management, namely regionalisation. Regionalisation is the cornerstone of the common fisheries policy. It allows for a programmed management of fisheries in accordance with the specifics of the different basins of the Union. Indeed, measures that work in the Baltic Sea will not have the same effects in the Mediterranean and vice versa. These geographical characteristics must therefore be taken into account. For this reason, we are gradually putting in place multi-year management plans for each basin. Two management plans have already been adopted, for the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. The plan for western waters is therefore the third plan on which the co-legislators have agreed. The plan includes 34 stocks operated by at least seven EU Member States, operating in waters from the west of Scotland to the waters around Madeira and the Azores, via the English Channel, the Celtic Sea and the Bay of Biscay. The range is therefore considerable. Among these stocks, we can now, and thanks to the majority vote of Parliament last October, count the bar. The bar is a popular species not only for professionals, but also for recreational fishers. It is also a species whose stock is in decline. Emergency measures are put in place each year to regenerate the resource. As these annual measures did not provide the necessary visibility for both professional and recreational fishers, it was time to address them. Including this species in a management plan is therefore an essential step towards the sustainable management of this stock. For this reason, I welcome both Parliament's vote and the agreement with the Council. I am also very pleased, because of the end of the artificial delimitation of the 48th parallel for bar fishing. This limit was simply absurd for both professional and recreational fishers. We cannot continue to impose different management measures north and south of this parallel, it does not take into account the realities on the ground. Other species are also covered by this plan, fortunately, sea bream, cod, sole or even the yellow place. For all these stocks, we will now have sustainable and programmed management, providing greater predictability to the fishing sector. The TACs and quotas negotiated annually by the Council for Western Waters are now regulated to avoid drastic quota cuts. This plan is also of particular importance in the context of Brexit. Indeed, British waters, such as the English Channel, are directly affected by this plan. Therefore, with the adoption of this plan before the UK leaves the European Union, it will be part of the Community's achievements during the transition period and will lay the foundations for future fisheries cooperation with the United Kingdom.

The Western Waters Plan completes the set of multiannual plans on the Atlantic side of the Union’s waters. It continues on the path of regionalisation, allowing Member States to submit joint recommendations, for example on discard plans, to implement the landing obligations. With this new Plan we ensure that fishermen have the necessary tools for sustainable fishing practices, for example, by adapting their gear to fish more selectively. It is now for the stakeholders of the Western Waters to put these tools into practice and to ensure tailor-made solutions to specific challenges in the different fisheries of the Western Waters.

This multiannual plan, of course, aims to ensure that stocks are sustainably exploited and that management is based on the most up-to-date scientific information. And the focus of this plan—as has already been said—is the same as that of the North Sea, the Baltic Sea and the recently approved one for the Mediterranean. The multiannual approach will enable long-term planning of fisheries resource management, avoiding sharp fluctuations in fishing opportunities, while providing greater legal certainty for operators to better plan their businesses. It also allows for greater participation of local fishermen and offers tailor-made measures by basins and fisheries. It also allows you to move away from the micromanagement of Brussels, something that has always been criticized. The objective of achieving population exploitation that respects the principle of maximum sustainable yield is something that is also confirmed. And with regard to recreational fishing, which can have a major impact on stock mortality, it was agreed that the Council will be able to take appropriate measures if necessary. On the other hand, Member States will take measures for the monitoring and collection of data, which is important, as there is often no real estimate of the catch levels of this fisheries. Finally, highlight the relationship between the regulation of technical measures, which I hope that very soon - the day after tomorrow – we will be able to reach an agreement by the Commission, the Council and Parliament, and the multiannual plans.

I think so, we got a good end result.  First, because it was ensured the maintenance of one of the most ambitious objectives of the CFP, that is, it remained registered to achieve the maximum sustainable yield by 2020. I know that in some cases this is an ambitious objective and that there is still a long way to go, but we have maintained this ambition under the Regulation. Secondly, because we have included improvements in the protection of sensitive species, resources and important habitats, in particular through the possibility of definite areas of protection for juveniles and for the recovery of springs.  Regionalisation and management proximity, recommended in multiannual plans such as this one, are a solution that has already proven. An example of this is the case of goraz in the Azores, for which several specific management measures were established, resulting from technical measures implemented. The most up-to-date scientific data shows that this feature has been reamy. The regional plan established together with the fishermen allowed positive results, both in the recovery of the species and in the financial benefits obtained. The measures also involved the establishment of Marine Protected Areas and fishing reserves. This management tool is unavoidable and must be multiplied. Finally, these plans will have to contribute to landing obligations, but we have to allow exceptions: individuals fished below the minimum size and who have proven relevant survival rates should be returned to the sea. Bringing to land fished without interest and that, surviving, can reproduce and later be caught with greater economic benefit is doubly positive.

That is why this plan, as it reaches the Plenary, is a step forward on the previous situation, but it still presents weaknesses. We insist on three issues in order to eliminate them. First, better define the concept of \"best available scientific data\". We should only consider studies carried out using transparent working methods and a certification of neutrality by solvent technical authorities to be valid. Secondly, to strengthen the guarantees that professionals should enjoy in the face of catches of high-value species by recreational fishing enthusiasts. The weight of recreational catches on populations must be weighed and any competition in the market between professional and recreational catches should be avoided. Thirdly, empower the European Commission to act when national authorities do not exercise the responsibilities and powers offered to them by this Regulation under regionalisation. Adapting basic principles to specific situations should not be confused with shether to stop applying them. Finally, we are pleased that the possibility that the Council may suspend, albeit briefly and for exceptional reasons, the bans on catches decreed to recover a species has been eliminated.

The agreement that was recently reached on the multiannual plan for fish stocks in the western waters and adjacent waters is an important one. Not only because it has proven difficult to find agreement on such plans in the past, but because it is a strong agreement that will help to ensure the sustainable exploitation of stocks in Belgian, German, French, Irish, Spanish, Portuguese and, yes, United Kingdom waters. We are all aware of the challenges faced by the fishing sector in the western waters. Fishers in my constituency in the southern coast of Ireland face significant challenges due to the obligations of our fisheries policies targeting specific species in this region. It is difficult due to catches being mixed and this, combined with the landing obligation and inability to discard catches, makes life difficult. I am pleased, therefore, to see this agreement incorporate all relevant stocks into a single management plan, replacing the existing single species which would allow for some flexibility for fisheries.

I will repeat an idea that is known and shared by many: I would have liked that there would have been two plans for western waters, one for the north and one for the south, because they are very different areas. But we have been pragmatic, because it could not take long for a plan for better resource management to take long either. And there is another point which I would like to underline and which I repeated in the Committee on Fisheries: I have not supported the inclusion in the Bass Plan. At this point I disagree with the rapporteur, Mr Cadec. It is a species not subject to TAC or quotas, and the state of the resource is not the same in western waters, it is very different. For example, in Galicia, in my land, it is selectively captured, it is at sustainable levels. Unfortunately, the amendments I made on this point last October were not supported by the House.

To ensure this, they need to provide the tools to ensure a practical and sustainable management framework for our mixed demersal fisheries. The co-legislators have achieved this with the Western Waters Plan. It was not only important to have a multiannual plan in place for the Western Waters but also to have the multiannual plan as soon as possible. This is the way to implement the regionalisation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), which is an important feature of the latest CFP reform in 2013. It provides a tool to facilitate reaching the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) objective by defining ranges of fishing opportunities in line with MSY. This provides the necessary flexibility to reduce potential choke problems. With the 2020 deadline approaching, it is important to have this possibility in place as soon as possible.

As you have said, Commissioner, and I would remind you that the maximum sustainable yield must be achieved, for all stocks, in 2020. This is why management plans will obviously be useful. However, it has taken us too long, far too long, to put them in place, and now the goal of sustainable maximum return in 2020 seems difficult to achieve, it must be said. On the other hand, we sometimes have to get out of political dogma to correspond to the realities on the ground, I am obviously thinking of our colleagues in the Greens, for example. This is also the case with the landing obligation, which, as we had foreseen, is almost impossible for multi-specific fleets. Having said that, the multi-year management plan for western waters is the result of a delicate balance, always the same, between the protection of the resource, which is indispensable, and the economic competitiveness of the fishing sector, which we want.

This protocol is expected to enable the European Union and the Republic of Côte d'Ivoire to work more closely together to promote the responsible exploitation of fisheries resources in The Waters of Côte d'Ivoire and to support the country's efforts to develop the local economy from the contribution made by the fisheries sector. In good time, the Committee on Fisheries, by my proposal, understood that it would carry out a more detailed assessment and consideration of this agreement, its history and future prospects, making considerations and recommendations which is now expected that the European Commission will take into account during the duration of the Protocol and its possible future renegotiation. The first fisheries agreement between Côte d'Ivoire and the European Community dates back to 1990. Despite the fact that 28 years, almost 29 years have passed, the results obtained so far in the field of sectoral cooperation are clamorously scarce. This is a reality that needs to be changed. The agreement should promote effective sustainable development of the Ivorian fisheries sector, as well as related industries and activities by increasing the added value in the country as a result of the exploitation of its natural resources. Better coordination is needed between sectoral support under the fisheries agreement and the instruments available in development cooperation, in particular the European Development Fund through both its national programming and regional programming within the West Africa region. The European Commission should take the necessary measures, including the possible revision and increase of the sector support agreement component, alongside improving the conditions for increasing the absorption rate of this support in order to ensure an effective reversal of the path taken in recent decades. As with other countries in the region, it is considered necessary to improve the quantity and reliability of catch information and in general on the state of conservation of fisheries resources, alongside the development of Ivory Coast's own capacity for acquiring this information. I can only thank the shadow rapporteurs for their work and the attention they have given to these reports and stress that Parliament must be immediately and fully informed at all stages of the procedures relating to the protocol or its renewal.

The renewal of the Protocol to the Sustainable Fishing Partnership Agreement will further strengthen this relationship. Through this partnership, the Ivory Coast not only offers access to its waters to EU vessels, but it also processes the products stemming from these vessels’ fishing activities and further exports them to the EU. This partnership will also help improve the sustainability of the fisheries sector, in particular through fighting illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. Combating IUU fishing is a priority for both the European Union and the Ivory Coast as IUU fishing threatens the natural resources and lives of local fishermen depending on them. This will reinforce the ongoing collaboration with the West Africa regional bodies and the European Fisheries Control Agency on monitoring, control and surveillance operations funded by PESCAO regional development programmes. This new six—year Protocol provides increased funds to support the Ivory Coast’s fisheries policy. It will contribute to the establishment of a meaningful surveillance capacity and improved governance, and it will also support the development of the blue economy, inland aquatic resources and artisanal fisheries. We have placed special emphasis on the benefits for local operators as Abidjan is a major port in the region. Indeed, the EU tuna fleet operating off the coast of Western Africa lands a great part of the catches in Abidjan to supply local canneries. This supports employment locally in the canneries, but also on board EU vessels as Ivorian seamen are in the first rank of non—EU nationals employed. Landings of EU vessels are also supporting the activities of small—scale economic operators. I would like to mention here the association of women organised to collect and transform such resources for local use. They have clearly expressed their needs for a supply from our vessels’ landings so that they could make a decent living from their activities. The Commission is engaged in a dialogue with the industry to ensure that landings become a regular source of revenue for these women, as it is our conviction that EU industrial activities also need to benefit local small operators.

Tuna seedlings use it both for their transfer and sales operations to the country's canneries and for supplies and crew change, embarking a large number of sailors of this nationality. But above all, the sustainable fisheries agreements concluded by the European Union with third countries are, as the name suggests, a unique tool available to the European Union to increase fisheries cooperation with third countries by promoting a sustainable fisheries policy and also sustainable exploitation of fishery resources outside the waters of the European Union. And this is in everyone's interest. It is good for operators in the European Union, it is good for local development, for combating illegal fishing, for sustainability and for good governance of the oceans. In parts of the world where there are no agreements with the European Union, there are often fleets that do not respect fishing resources or the marine environment. Neither the social conditions of workers nor sustainability. These fleets compete directly with our European Union operators and often catch the same fish and sell them to the same markets, but at much lower prices. For this reason, maintaining such agreements is vital.

In this case, thirty-six tuna sewn-up boats from Spain, France and Portugal will fish under this agreement which will be in force until 2024; a key agreement for the Basque tuna fleet, whose ships also have been in place with independent certifications of good environmental and social practices since 2010, when they were recognized as \"friends of the sea\". As mentioned, the economic contributions to the agreement will be offset by Ivory Coast on the one hand by catches, but most of the resources go to the development of the local fisheries sector. In this chapter a central element is the support for the operations of the port of Abidán, affected at the time by the Council's sanctions against the Laurent Gbagbo regime. The promotion of local professionals and businesses is completed by a commitment to the quality of scientific studies on fishing stocks, the establishment of biologically protected fishing areas and the strengthening of undeclared, unregulated and unregulated anti-fishing control measures.

That is why we have produced a significant number of reports on the application of the rules governing our institutions. We are ripe for the final momentum on those issues that we have found particularly relevant. In my case, I have had the honour of being the rapporteur of the report on the implementation of the provisions of the Treaty relating to citizenship of the Union, at a time as key as the one we are experiencing. \"Collective public policies are the only thing that can create citizens with the confidence of individuals,\" says Timothy Snyder in his latest book. The concept of Citizenship of the Union has been introduced for more than twenty years, and today at least one generation of Europeans has grown up as Community citizens. And a generation of children need adjustments and improvements to the concept of European citizenship by the time they are, in a short time, our young Europeans. The Treaties say that it is a citizen of the European Union who has the nationality of one of its Member States. In this way, citizenship of the Union is in addition to state citizenship. However, the law has fallen short of reality. About what young people and children already perceive. We have a responsibility to take on the results that European barometers reveal to us over and over again. 87% of Europeans are aware of their status as citizens – the highest percentage ever recorded. But between what they perceive and reality there is a mismatch. There are gaps, there is a deficit and there is a need to give real scope to some of these freedoms. Union citizens do not exercise the right of active and passive suffrage in European and municipal elections as much as they could. Most of them need more information. And exercising their active citizenship, politics, is key to building much more inclusive, more prosperous, more responsible societies, with fewer risks of temptations to exclusionary populism. Nationalist and populist ideologies promote exclusionary identities; once again we know in Europe. And, on the horizon, this always brings a decline in rights. They give false solutions to real and complex problems, and feed on the spread of victimism. Our responsibility is to make improvements that make solutions, and that also provide solutions in improving what this European citizenship means. Freedom of movement is now enshrined, but has limits on implementation. Pointing out this circumstance is the first step in completing this freedom, which should be enjoyed, especially, by the younger ones. In this context, effectively enhancing programmes such as Erasmus+, programmes for volunteering, such as the European Voluntary Service and the European Solidarity Corps, fuel mobility opportunities. The educational and personal development of young Europeans is undoubtedly the best investment. An investment that comes out very profitable. This report also is committed to the development of 165 curriculum in education systems that allow us to know our common space, our European values, from Article 165 of the Treaty on Functioning. No policy has created as much a sense of Europeans as mobility and education. When knowledge is capitalized it always leads to a natural and spontaneous increase in the link between institutions and citizens. Commissioner Timmermans has told us many times through his own personal experiences. Okay, I'm going to finish. We have studied the full potential of Europe Direct options and the scope of rights and obligations to give them a greater chance to encourage participation. But there's something, there's something, to finish, that's very important. We need symbols. We need to follow luxembourg's example and set as a public holiday for the whole of Europe on 9 May. And we can ask the European Council to speak out for the Heads of State and Government to declare it festive. And, moreover, there are many issues on which we can reach full potential. A european Union citizenship status would be a novel instrument for this. That is why in this report we wanted to change the perspective and place citizens at the heart of the system for the future: citizenship, not an algorithm.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Alain LAMASSOURE", "mepid": "1204", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, we have had the opportunity to make this point on several occasions, the Lisbon Treaty is a fairly underutilized toolkit and among the possible procedures - and which are not being used sufficiently - are enhanced cooperation. As we know, enhanced cooperation is a formula that allows countries that want to move forward, while others would be more reluctant, to act, to move forward without waiting for others, in simplified procedures, in areas important to them and for Europe and which fall under shared competences between the Union and the Member States. However, it turns out that many of the major challenges facing the Union today will be difficult to deal with the crippling procedure of unanimity. I am talking about internal and external security, migration policy, a number of social programmes, a number of research programmes and a common foreign policy. It is therefore important to facilitate and encourage the use of this procedure. That is the purpose of the report adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. And we start from the acquis of the strengthened cooperations already existing and which show their interest because they apply to completely different areas: the settlement of divorce or family property disputes, the establishment of a single European patent, the establishment of a European prosecutor, projects that are difficult to commit to a financial transaction tax, the launch of a European defence, not to mention the organisation of the euro area. , which is also part of a form of enhanced cooperation. Our committee's implementation report draws lessons from these early experiences and proposes a kind of what could be a model status of enhanced cooperation to facilitate the task and save time for Member States which, in new areas, would like to use it. And we list the political questions to be asked: what is the decision-making process going to be? Of course, we recommend what the treaty makes possible, namely the systematic use of qualified majority voting and not the unanimous decision. What secretariat? We want the European Commission to have an important role in the secretariat. What is the financing method for administrative expenses, possibly operational expenses, if joint actions are planned? What democratic control? The European Parliament must play an important role, but in some areas it would be unimaginable if there would not also be representation of national parliaments to ensure parliamentary control. And then what judicial review? Of course, while the Court of Justice will always have the final say, it may be useful in some cases to establish - it has been done for patents - a trial court. Our committee recommends respecting the spirit of the treaties, which allow for joint action, allow for flexibility in decision-making and allow us to remain within the Community framework. Because according to enhanced cooperation, the Member States participating do so within the Community framework, while the other non-participating Member States can take part in the debate, give their opinion and - of course - they do not take part in the vote. But being associated from the beginning, they can better measure the value of the formula and it is hoped that, little by little, this cooperation will extend to all the Member States of the European Union. The issue is very important because if we want to tackle these major challenges that I mentioned earlier, there are only two solutions: either enhanced cooperation within the framework of the Union, or interstate, inter-governmental agreements that will make problems more difficult, procedures more obscure and democratic control less well assured.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 92, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Mercedes BRESSO", "mepid": "28346", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, parliamentary control of the executive is a precondition for the democratic legitimacy of the executive itself. Recent changes in legislative procedures and the increased role of the Community executive have created the need to strengthen parliament's control procedures.  As you know, Parliament has at its disposal various instruments for exercising its political control over the Commission: from the election of the President, to the investiture of Commissioners, to the motion of censure, to written and oral questions, to legislative initiative, albeit indirectly, through reports, to the budgetary procedure and to the implementation of the budget, etc. However, it is necessary to improve their application and adapt them to the specific challenges of the Union's institutional structure.  After an in-depth study of the situation, which involved many experts and lasted more than six months, the important points of this report are summarised. Firstly, the proposal to lower the threshold for triggering the motion of censure. We believe that the current threshold is too high to allow it to be used effectively, although of course it must not be too low to prevent abuse either. We therefore propose, in a forthcoming amendment to the Treaties – because the Treaties need to be amended – that it be lowered, probably around an absolute majority, but it will be part of the debate.  Within the framework of the current Treaties – my second point – Parliament does not formally have the right of legislative initiative. The report states the possibility of formally granting Parliament this initiative, which should also obviously be sown in the next amendment of the Treaties, again taking into account the specific problems, the specific issues, which may concern this Parliament, therefore not by attributing it to the individual Member but to larger aggregations.  Another point is the individual responsibility of commissioners. The report considers that a future amendment to the Treaties should consider making Commissioners individually responsible for the exercise of their mandate before Parliament.  Another point is the appointment of senior Commission officials. The report calls on the Commission to review its administrative procedures for the appointment of its Secretary-General, Directors-General and Directors, to ensure that the best candidates are selected transparently and that all the same opportunities are ensured. As you will have understood, this report, which is also an overview of political control over the Commission, also contains a number of political messages. The first is the guarantee of an effective system of counter-power in the Union's institutional area. Secondly, the strengthening of our controls on the appointment of senior officials who have a political role in the Commission. Thirdly, the politicisation of the Commission through the Spitzenkandidat process, to which we support it, does, however, involve greater and more individual control of the Commissioners. And finally: a formal allocation of the legislative initiative to our Parliament.  I would like to conclude by thanking my shadow rapporteurs for their excellent spirit of cooperation with which they have worked and hoping that tomorrow, also taking into account the many compromises we have reached, the vote will be broadly positive and shared.  This vote tomorrow will not be the only one. That is why, on behalf of my group, I should like to say something about the other reports on which we shall be voting tomorrow. First of all, I would like to congratulate my colleagues Mr Spinelli and Mr Pagazaurtundúa Ruiz on the Lamassoure report, for which I am shadow rapporteur. I would like to acknowledge the excellent compromise work carried out by the rapporteur. He was particularly good at stressing the need to make the use of enhanced cooperation more flexible. These are a fundamental instrument for improving the construction of Europe, where we cannot find a compromise that brings together the 28 Member States.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to explain the basic objectives I have pursued in the long work on the report on the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  There is one point on which I have stressed in particular, and that is that the Union must not be passive towards the rights enshrined in the Charter, it must not confine itself to preventing any violation of these rights, but must actively promote them, that is to say, their systematic and preliminary amalgamation into all the measures and decisions taken by the Union. This is not only an obligation under international human rights law, but a duty expressly enshrined in the Charter itself.  The Charter has certainly been a turning point in European integration, but its adoption cannot and must not be seen as a final goal. The nature of the Charter is evolutionary, influenced by international law and the case law of the Court. It is the full realisation of the rights enshrined in it that must be constantly sought.  I am not saying this at random, I say this on the basis of the conviction that the crisis in the Union is too wide and that the gap that has been created between citizens and The European institutions is too wide for the situation not to be taken into account, starting with the citizens, their discontent and their feeling that they are being ignored in their rights. In many European policies, the rights listed in the Charter do not have the space that is formally guaranteed to them by European law, as well as by the case law of the Court of Justice. They are often ignored, especially when social rights and the relationship between them and the requirements of competitiveness in the single market are at stake.  The rights of those who, whether irregularly or regularly, enter and reside in the territory of the Union and are therefore part of our legal system are also ignored. Hence my call for systematic impact assessments on rights, both preliminary and ex post, whenever policies are adopted in crucial areas, such as economic stability policies, especially in the eurozone, trade policies and agreements with third countries signed by the Eu ropean Union, migration policy. These issues are partly already present in the report, but which I repeat in some of the amendments for plenary, both on so-called economic governance and on refugees and migrants, whose right to non-refoulement we are called upon to respect by law. The aim of this text is to clarify the role of the Charter, highlighting the difficulties that continue to arise in its full implementation. Stress testing is a tool used to probe banks' resilience; we should also start using similar tests for the maintenance of fundamental rights.  My intention is to provide ideas and proposals which should not be controversial and which can consolidate the solemn promise made to our citizens by adopting the Charter as the Union's legal basis and an indispensable complement to the Treaties. The promise to build a community based on respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 96, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, the four reports under discussion today present an interesting analysis of the Union’s functioning in connection with citizenship and fundamental rights, whilst providing a contribution to the debate on the Future of the Union on various institutional questions. I cannot, of course, cover every part of these rich reports here this evening. As concerns Ms Bresso’s report, I would like to stress that this College of Commissioners has taken very seriously its political accountability to Parliament. Cooperation between our two institutions is set out in the Framework Agreement and in the Inter-Institutional Agreement on Better Law-Making, which, together with relevant Treaty provisions, provide a framework in which Parliament can effectively exercise its political oversight of the Commission. The Commission considers that these arrangements have worked well and the benefits of our good cooperation, in my view, are clear.  The fact that we have set joint legislative priorities through joint declarations has helped focus political attention on the proposals that matter most in terms of addressing citizens’ concerns and expectations. Good progress has been made, too, on various institutional issues that are priorities for this House. I also welcome the fact that agreement was reached on non-binding delineation criteria for delegated acts and implementing acts, and I hope that tomorrow’s trilogue will result in agreement on the alignment to the Lisbon Treaty of empowerments and the regulatory procedure with scrutiny in approximately 60 legislative acts. As concerns Parliament’s proposal on the right of inquiry, while sharing many of the serious concerns expressed by the Council, the Commission, as always, stands ready to engage constructively and find appropriate solutions. The unanimity rule has, in some cases, hampered effective decision making and timely Union action. The Commission has therefore called for the use of the ‘passerelle clause’ to move to qualified majority voting in certain areas of common foreign and security policy, taxation and the environment. In the taxation area in particular, this would also mean less need for recourse to enhanced cooperation, which is the subject of Mr Lamassoure’s report. I certainly agree with him – and I remember fondly the time we spent working on the Lisbon Treaty – that the Treaty is not being used to its full potential today. Many things are still being ignored or not used to full potential. The Commission welcomes these two reports that actively promote the debate on the Union’s future institutional development. I have to note, however, that treaty change is not currently on the agenda and that many of the ideas would affect the interinstitutional balance or the prerogatives of the other institutions. Turning to Ms Pagazaurtundúa Ruiz’s report on European citizenship: our two institutions have been close allies in promoting and defending European citizens’ rights and the rule of law. I have to say that the rapporteur has always been a staunch supporter of the Commission’s position, and I want to thank her for that, on behalf of the Commission and in a personal capacity. The Commission remains fully committed to the Union’s accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. The consultation process to address the legal issues raised by the Court is making good progress, but is not yet completed. Then, if we resolve that, there remain some issues to be resolved in the Council of Europe as well.  I am grateful that, like the Commission, this Parliament has consistently kept questions of the rule of law high on its agenda, although all of us would have strongly preferred that this had not been necessary. The Commission will present an initiative later this year on strengthening the rule-of-law framework in the light of experience and will take good account of your views in this regard. Many of you have worked very hard on this. The Commission has taken action throughout its term of office to promote the democratic rights of citizens, culminating in the package of proposals in September to enhance transparency, combat disinformation and ensure that individual data is not abused, in the context of the upcoming elections. The recent agreement on the amendments to the statute of European political parties is very welcome indeed. The Commission has also recently published a report on investor citizenship and resident schemes – so-called golden passports and visas – and will set up a group of experts from Member States to improve the transparency, governance and security of such schemes.  Finally, with regard to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Ms Spinelli’s report is right to point out that, regrettably, the Charter is still not being used to its full potential. Far from it. Upholding common values and fundamental rights is a shared responsibility of local, regional, national, European and international actors and institutions. We all need to work together. The Commission is using a wide range of instruments to ensure the full effectiveness of the Charter. These include infringement proceedings to address values-related violations of EU law by Member States, audits and investigations relating to the use of EU funds, and the European Semester to monitor national justice reforms. We agree with you that, ahead of the elections, all the EU institutions should make an effort to promote the benefits of, and advances made on, European Union citizenship and respect for the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Beyond that, our energies in the coming weeks should be focused on delivering on a positive agenda by securing good outcomes in the pending legislative negotiations. The Commission welcomes the energy and commitment of this Parliament. The Romanian Presidency will continue to engage actively and constructively with you to deliver concrete results across all areas of the 10 priorities of the Juncker Commission, priorities that were established together with you. Together we should show, ahead of the elections, that the Union is able to deliver concrete results and respond to citizens’ expectations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 97, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Eduard KUKAN", "mepid": "96651", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Mr President, I will speak on the subject of the implementation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union in the EU institutional framework.

The goal of achieving gender equality is crucial to ensuring that the EU policies reflect the perspectives and interests of both women and men. However, there is still a long way to go to reach gender equality within the European Union and it is regrettable that gender mainstreaming is not consistently implemented in all EU activities, which prevents the effective implementation of measures to combat gender discrimination and promote gender equality.

Will the electorate decide in future who will be President of the Commission, who will be President of the European Executive, or will it be done in the back of the way? And that can only be done if the Council accepts what is in the Treaty. It can only make one proposal, in the light of the outcome of the European elections and after consultation with the European Parliament. And this European Parliament must be able to find a majority for a candidate in order to make a proposal. That is a crucial question – and does this House have the strength to do so? I believe that we should support our leading candidates, regardless of party, to campaign in this way. And to Mrs Spinelli, I would like to make a point: we have campaigned actively for this Charter of Fundamental Rights. But this is not a question of political implementation. A Charter of Fundamental Rights is there to examine whether legislation complies with these fundamental rights. And if it does not have this level of fundamental rights, then it can be brought before the European Court of Justice to do so. That is the crucial question.

This report comes at a crucial time for the European project. At a time when this European project is under violent attack, next May's elections are decisive for the future of this European Union that we have built over the last few decades. So now, more than ever, Europeans need to gain full awareness of their status as citizens and make use of their first right of citizenship, the right to political participation through voting. In order to do so, a pedagogical campaign to raise awareness of citizens' rights, starting with the right to vote, is necessary, a major campaign, therefore, against abstention.

There is one main reason for this: voters do not feel that there is a straight connection between what they vote for and what policy they will get. Because of the complicated decision-making system, if they vote, for example, for the Socialist Group to be the biggest here, it is not at all sure that they will get more socialist politics in the EU, nor a socialist in charge of the Commission. Strengthening the link between the results of the election and policy, through the Spitzenkandidat procedure, may make European voters more prone to vote.

Problems only arise when these rights start to proliferate and it becomes impossible to know whether a right is fundamental or not. We are currently in the midst of an inflation of rights. Second, when we raise the question of rights, are we focusing on law or on politics? If you do not keep the two separate, we politicise the law and legalise politics and that is not compatible with democracy. Third, if we frame everything in the language of rights, then compromise, the keystone of democratic politics, becomes difficult to attain. The underlying dynamic of rights is a moral imperative, and morality is all but impossible to compromise.

In this regard, the report calls for the Agency's regulation to be revised to enable it to deliver opinions on EU legislation on its own initiative.

Only closed heads of nationalists do not understand this. After all, each of us, as a citizen of an EU country, has European citizenship which gives many freedoms and privileges as a result of real integration. As always, in addition to privileges, there are responsibilities, even participation in elections. The 'This Time I Am Voting' action to increase turnout is important, because the results of this election will determine the future of the Union. The report proposes a European Statute for Citizenship, which will be gathered from various Union documents on civil rights and opportunities and democracy building through participation. There is nothing more important today than to awaken the need to participate in European democracy by influencing decisions. Citizens' participation in shaping the EU agenda reinforces their sense of co-responsibility in the European project. The lack of active participation develops a sense of uncertainty and threats, fuelled by populism.

It would be impossible for me not to acknowledge that, in those 33 years, European citizens from east and west, north and south have grown closer together. In that sense, an ever-closer Union is something that I have seen happening in my lifetime. It is not anybody’s dream to impose a ‘superstate’ or something of that nature. It is about citizens sharing, more and more, the same values and coming closer together on what they think is important for them and their children. Who could say today that a Polish citizen living in the European Union is less free than a Polish citizen before Poland joined the European Union? Nobody could say that! Who could say today that any citizen, in any Member State, has lost her or his identity because of the European Union? I honestly believe identities are more protected thanks to the European Union, thanks to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and thanks to all the legal norms that the European Union and its Member States have adhered to. So let’s not turn things around. Let’s see them in the right historical perspective. I wanted, at least, to share with you my perspective. I respect all the other perspectives, but this is mine, from my experience. I want to add that the reports we’re discussing today are part of an ongoing process of institutions trying to work within the legal order that we have, the Treaties, to try to improve the situation: not just creating more power for themselves but doing something about our citizens’ worries, and finding answers to the big challenges. And, boy, has the European Union been challenged in the past 10 years! Crisis after crisis – and, every time, this Parliament has responded with great responsibility to those crises, working together closely with the Commission, sometimes not so closely with the Council, but all three of us trying to find solutions. These reports reflect the wish of the majority of this Parliament to do an ever-better job, and the Commission will be on your side to try to improve its activities, to work together to improve our performance for European citizens. I would invite you to join me in trying to convince the Council to take similar steps forward. I think this is important. I want to end on the issue raised by Alain Lamassoure. Chers collègues, chers parlementaires, je voudrais vous dire que la pensée d’Alain Lamassoure, qui est convaincu que nous pouvons encore faire un grand nombre de choses au sein du traité que nous avons aujourd’hui entre les mains, est une réalité politique qui nous pousse à agir, sur la base de ce qui est écrit dans les rapports, mais aussi avec une volonté politique en cherchant une majorité au Parlement européen. Certes, cette majorité ne sera pas la même qu’auparavant, certes il y aura beaucoup de travail à faire, mais je crois vraiment que les traités existants nous offrent de très nombreuses possibilités. Un jour, il faudra changer les traités mais, pour le moment, nous devrons travailler avec les traités existants. Et ce que M. Lamassoure a écrit dans son rapport nous conduit à chercher des réponses aux défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain, au sein des traités, en rapprochant l’Union européenne de ses citoyens. Je m’adresse maintenant directement à Alain Lamassoure, en reconnaissance du travail qu’il a fait au Parlement européen, en reconnaissance du travail qu’il a fait pour l’intégration européenne, afin d’aider l’Union à relever les défis d’aujourd’hui et de demain, et aussi, si je puis dire, pour son amitié, son intégrité et sa pensée vraiment très européenne.

You have to have a very closed identity and that seeks homogeneity—that is, cutting people off their freedoms—to think that here we are trying to impose some kind of identity. Nothing further from reality. However, we have to explain to the citizens that there are those who do not want them to have more rights as European citizens, that they do not want them to have the right to complete what European mobility is, that they do not want investment, that they do not want social issues so that young people, especially young people, can live more fully and move from one place to another. That there are those who look in a suspicious way, as if it were something embarrassing, that we can have a common day, a European Day.

Mr President, I would first like to thank Pascal Durand, Ramon Juregui Atondo and you, Mr Vice-President, for the very kind words you have had for me and also thank, for their applause, all those who look at us on the internet. I would like to add a very important point, and I believe, again, Mr Vice-President, that you will agree with this analysis, one of the reasons why enhanced cooperation has not worked sufficiently is because none of the three institutions have really organised themselves to carry them out, to take them seriously and to take them seriously and to appropriate them. Basically, on the Commission's side as well as on the side of Parliament, when we say that there is enhanced cooperation, we understand that some States are interested in this and that it is not really Community. And as governments themselves change, on the Council's side, what is a priority for some governments at some point is no longer a priority when there have been electoral changes in the countries that were the initiators. And that is why we recommend in our report that every institution, including the European Commission, organise itself: will it take a special Commissioner? This question could be decided by a future President of the Commission. Should an ad hoc committee be set up in our Parliament?  Rather, we recommend, whenever there is enhanced cooperation, that a subcommittee be set up in the Standing Committee and that we try to resolve this issue, which we have never settled in the European Parliament, because there had been no majority so far. I hope that things will change with the future Parliament. We must ensure that it is a matter of going to the vote, those who are elected by the citizens to whom the decisions will apply are, of course, those who vote, and that those who are not elected by the States in which enhanced cooperation will not apply participate at that time, in the spirit of the treaty, in the deliberations and discussions, but not in the vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Mercedes BRESSO", "mepid": "28346", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Tomašić, I would like to remind you that most of our countries have ratified this Treaty twice – the first time as a Constitutional Treaty, the second as the Treaty of Lisbon – and that your country has entered the European Union by ratifying it. So its legitimacy is indisputable, and it is a serious nonsense to constantly question it as you do.  Returning to our reports, I believe that all these reports are an example of how the Treaty of Lisbon also offers many instruments to make the functioning of our institutions clearer and more transparent. And each of these reports goes in this direction: to make the functioning of the institutions more democratic.  In particular, in my report, we very much address the need to take into account the complexity of the European parafederal system, and therefore a problem of vertical control, because there are many executive entities – and the Commission alone is not the executor of all the activities related to directives and regulations – but also horizontal. The issue, for example, of the enormous role played by the agencies, whose control escapes Parliament very much, if not in terms of budget.  So the problem of preventing the European institutions from being accused of excessive bureaucracy stems from this too, from the impression that the citizens have that this control ultimately escapes everyone a little. It escapes the main executive, which is the Commission, escapes Parliament, is even more likely to escape the Council, and is becoming more and more complex.  I therefore believe that work of greater transparency, clarity and strength in control should be done, or will have to do so, in the next term of office, as there will be.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 129, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Barbara SPINELLI", "mepid": "124810", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to conclude by insisting on the crisis of the last decade. It has increased the Commission's powers of direction, which in many Member States are not always considered legitimate and democratic. It is a question of giving it back this very fragile legitimacy without a more systematic reference to the Charter.  Commissioner Malmström once said that, in negotiating TTIP, the European executive could not take account of objections from civil society. He said: 'I have not received a mandate from the people of Europe'. It is obvious that in this way the institutions appear distant, hostile to bottom-up movements.  The challenge of sovereignty must be met with a sovereignty that is shared, yes, but based on the needs of the various peoples to see their social and civil rights respected. If we do not take this into account, if we create a confrontation between sovereignists and Pro-Europeans for electoral use, we will necessarily fall into the language that is no longer political but theological in which Donald Tusk fell, according to which there would be a special place in hell for those in Britain who negotiate badly to leave the Union.

The European Ombudsman is a key part of the institutional system of the European Union and an essential aid at the disposal of European citizens, who are entitled to good administration from the EU institutions and bodies. I would like to commend the Ombudsman’s work in fighting maladministration, which has been highly effective. This is illustrated, for example, by the high compliance rate of EU institutions and bodies with her recommendations, which is around 80%. In this context, we welcome the Parliament’s report on the Ombudsman’s Statute. It is, of course, essential that the outcome of this review fully respects the respective roles of the EU institutions and bodies as established by the Treaty. I’d like to make a few preliminary remarks without prejudice to the formal opinion that the Commission will issue at a later stage, as foreseen in the Treaty. We would agree in principle to amendments that consolidate current practice, which in our experience has worked well. This includes the possibility for the Ombudsman to propose solutions and for the deadline for the Commission to reply to recommendations to be able to be extended by two months. Extending the possibilities for the Ombudsman to appear before the European Parliament would also be welcome as, in principle, is the possibility for the Ombudsman to refer issues to OLAF and the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. As regards the proposed extension to three years of the deadline for lodging a complaint, we’d like to better understand the reasons for such an extension. We’re not opposed in principle but, to our knowledge, the current two-year period does not seem to have raised any practical problems. In addition, the more time that has elapsed, the more difficult it is for the administration to effectively address the issue raised by the complainant. I would also like to recall that the Ombudsman’s role is to deal with cases of maladministration.

Mr President! And thank you also for mr. Timmermanns' review here. I can completely share it.

I don't know what happened in AFCO. For my part, I would like to mention two matters which are crucial – as Mr Schroeder has said. Mr Timmermanns also touched on – namely those related to good administration. One is that we must have made it absolutely clear that access to documents must be a matter of course and that it is only the extremely rare cases that it cannot be granted. I would very much like to ask that amendment No 9.  The second is conflicts of interest. It is still a major problem in all our countries that there are conflicts of interest in large parts of our administration where it is not enough just to say that you have it. They must not be there at all if the citizens are to trust us. That is why I would ask you to do so!

The function of the Ombudsman, therefore, is to ensure that, in these areas of activity, accountability and procedural consistency are observed fully.

Our way of life involves a lot of flying and when you are flying you cannot control the flight time. I am happy to have been able to attend a significant part of the debate and to speak at the end of it. Mr President, I would like to say that I am very proud to present this report, right away because it has had the unanimous support of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and therefore means that a basis has been achieved here which is a basis, I would say, very consensual within the members of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and that it was from one side of the bench to the other going through all the political groups that are represented there , so this is the first point. The second is that it was extremely necessary to reform the Statute of the European Ombudsman because, perhaps not everyone is aware, but the statute we had was before the Treaty of Lisbon and, therefore, it is really a question here of getting, at least to the electorate, in the 2019 elections, a text which is already in line with EU law which has been in force for almost ten years. I must say, moreover, that it is also a matter of great pride that this is one of the cases in which Parliament has legislative initiative and is therefore a unique case from a constitutional point of view and is therefore also an important report to that extent. Having said that, I would like to say what the two principles led to the making of this report. The first was: we need a new appropriate statute, but under no case do we want to break with the idea of soft law and soft power associated with the Ombudsman. The power of the Ombudsman, the power of the ombudsman is a soft power, it is a soft power, it is an informal power. The day he is a party to a process, on the day he has binding interventions, even in very finished domains, he loses his power. One of the reasons why the European institutions, the various bodies of the European Union, trust the Ombudsman is because they know that their power is not binding. Your authority and strength come from your weakness, come from your frailty. Now there were some proposals and some attempts to make a kind of proxy the ombudsman. Now the ombudsman is not a proxy, the provider is not a prossecutor, it is not a tax ministry and therefore, in this sense, it is not a ministero pubblico, as the Italians say and therefore it is essential to maintain this soft power and I believe that balance we have maintained. Then the second concern was to strengthen the independence, impartiality, exemption of the Ombudsman, giving him all the means to act, ensuring that he can have access to all bodies and entities and can have access to confidential information although, of course, it is bound by this confidentiality. But this can be very important because often to reach some of its conclusions, in the various investigations that opens, in the various steps it makes, the ability, on the one hand, to access confidential documents or confidential information, but maintaining confidentiality effectively gives it this status. So what we did was also strengthen some of its guarantees of independence even in its financial status, etc., was to give here some, I would say, practical translation to the guarantee of independence, impartiality and exemption of the Ombudsman and, therefore, to maintain its status of soft power. I used to say that these are the two big weapons of intervention, then there are small adjustments, small adjustments, in the rights of complaint, in a set of small matters, which I think improve, but do not break with what is the tradition of an institution, which so far has worked well, and finally, it is often said, even in football, that, as a team that wins does not move. And so in a team like this, which is a winning team, which is that of the European Ombudsman, of course we move as little as possible, we move the essentials to strengthen its status and we are very pleased that a great consensus has been reached in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. I hope that this consensus will also be reflected in a vote in plenary that strengthens the European Ombudsman as a body in which not only European entities, but especially the citizens of the European Union, can trust and trust fully.

Madam President, I wanted to tell you the story of Jupiter returning to Earth. Emmanuel Macron had been elected on a promise: to be a bulwark against the extremes and the \"new world\" singer. To do so, he formed a parliamentary majority populated by incompetents and relied on a government composed of ambitious inexperienced people and some fine war catches. Two years later, and three fewer ministers of state, the president had ruled everything in his path: intermediary bodies, unions, communities and his own friends. With his arrogance, Jupiter continued his ascent and, to his great detriment, began his apprenticeship when men in yellow came to remind him of the truth of the Earth by occupying all the roundabouts. These scoundrels, these scum, those people who were nothing in his eyes made the Republic waver. From his castle, King Emmanuel decided, under the pressure of their wrath, to drop ten billion euros of measures in favor of purchasing power, on the eve of Christmas, at the expense of the European budgetary orthodoxy of which he is the guarantor. Finally, the President of the Republic descended into the arena of debate in six-hour increments, always televised, in order to confront the consequences of his policy. Sun Tzu invented the art of war; Macron, on the other hand, invented the roundabout. Despite his best efforts, demonstration after demonstration, radicalism took over. Who was responsible: yellow vests or breakers, yellow vests or anarchists, yellow vests or law enforcement? While, on our faces, we barely dry the tears shed for the dead of the victims of terrorism, Charlie Hebdo or the Bataclan, what was not my surprise when I discovered the creation of a prize pool for the infamous boxer hitting a gendarme on the ground.  So I created mine in response, for the benefit of the 1,200 members of the security forces injured during the demonstrations. The result was clear: 130,000 euros for the boxer in front of 1.5 million for the police, with more than 51,000 donors. Morality of the story: the silent and indignant majority woke up, crushing the boxer's prize pool with his participatory generosity.

Unacceptable is the smashing of window panes, the targeted injury of police officers, the setting of cars or the arbitrary destruction of our streets and squares. A threat to public order and security has nothing to do with the right to freedom of expression.

This right, which is enshrined in the constitutions of all our countries, must be guaranteed and protected, especially for the benefit of those who do not have much other means to be heard. But the right to protest is not the right to trash, loot or break the cop. All too often demonstrations whose objectives are noble are taken hostage by small groups of excited, breakers or even looters, who distort their claims and even their legitimacy. The constitutional and legal responsibility of law enforcement is to prevent these groups from harming the safety of persons and property. They must, of course, do so in a proportionate manner and their slippages must be punished.

Yet their freedom to demonstrate is doubly threatened: first by black blocs and other professional breakers, who have been allowed to act with impunity for too many years and who take advantage of demonstrations to commit violence; then, by a scoundrel law, which is about to allow the prefects to prohibit protest to whom they want, without any prior intervention of a judge, on the pretext of such violence.

It is also important to maximise the reduce of administrative barriers often put in front of protesters. The registration of the protest rally must be quick, simple and free, instead of trying to discourage citizens with various compilations and levies.  The right to free protest, of course, does not presuppose violence, but violent individuals have a name and surname and should be individually punished and should not be used as justification for the disproportionate use of force against all protesters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 173, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "   Madam President, in a democratic society, the right to peaceful protest against government decisions is not only self-evident but also necessary.

This debate is timely because, given the discussions taking place in many regions in Europe, my colleague Commissioner Hogan and I have jointly addressed a letter to all the EU environment and agriculture ministers explaining the Commission’s approach to this issue and highlighting the support we provide, and I am happy to do the same in this House tonight. Having suffered a very serious decline in most areas of Europe, large carnivore populations have been recovering in recent decades, and returning to countries and regions of their former range. They are protected species under the EU Habitats Directive and their recovery is a contribution towards nature protection in Europe and towards halting global biodiversity loss. However, I am fully conscious of the challenge that the return of these species presents, especially in those areas where they had been absent for many decades and in rural areas with extensive livestock farming. That is why, for several years, the Commission has been supporting the active involvement of all relevant parties in finding suitable and acceptable approaches to reconciling the conservation of large carnivores and the legitimate interests of the people concerned. This work includes supporting and co-chairing the EU Large Carnivore Platform, bringing together key stakeholder groups to facilitate mutual understanding. Through the implementation of a European Parliament pilot project, the Commission is also helping to establish regional platforms, to foster dialogue among stakeholders and local authorities, in the areas where conflicts generated by the return of large carnivores are more frequent, for example in Romania, Italy and Spain. Projects under the Programme for Environment and Climate Action (LIFE) also contribute significantly to supporting the active involvement of all those concerned and a participatory approach, in order to find solutions based on coexistence. The Commission is aware of the fact that, at local level, the wolf may be an additional challenge for farmers in an already difficult social and economic context. In those areas where traditional livestock-protection practices have been abandoned, the return of the wolf certainly entails additional challenges for sheep farmers. That is why the Commission believes that the sector should be appropriately supported to reduce its vulnerability to predation and ensure its co-existence with wild carnivores. Support is available under national and EU funds, through LIFE and rural development projects, and further efforts are necessary to raise awareness among those concerned, so that all possibilities are fully availed of. In November last year, the Commission amended the EU guidelines for state aid in the agriculture and forestry sectors and in rural areas, in order to allow for full compensation, up to 100%, for damage caused by protected animals, including veterinary costs or costs related to the search for missing animals, and for full reimbursement, up to 100%, of investments to prevent such damage – for example in electric fences or livestock-guarding dogs. Regarding the calls from some quarters to address the challenges by changing our legislation, I would remind the House that, under its ‘smart regulation’ approach, the Commission keeps the entire EU legislative acquis under regular review. In December 2016, the Commission published the results of the fitness check evaluation of the EU Birds and Habitats Directives – what we called the nature directives. This confirmed that the current legal framework is sound and remains relevant, including as regards the directives’ annexes. All the EU institutions, the Member State governments and the record high number of citizens – more than 550 000 – who replied to a public consultation have supported such conclusions and confirmed that the Birds and Habitats Directives remain highly relevant and are fit for purpose. Therefore, the Commission has been devoting all its efforts to helping Member States and stakeholders to improve the directives’ implementation, addressing the weaknesses and challenges identified in the fitness check. To that end, in April 2017, we adopted an Action Plan for Nature, People and the Economy, to be implemented by the end of 2019. This action plan contains important elements related to the challenges of conserving large carnivores and addressing the associated conflicts. These include, firstly, the update of the guidance document on species protection under the Habitats Directive; and secondly, continuing and expanding support for the Large Carnivore Platform at EU and also at regional level. Thirdly, greater use of rural development measures will be promoted to support prevention of livestock predation by large carnivores. Fourthly, there is the increased LIFE funding for nature projects, including for the protection of species and for coexistence. Fifthly, on-the-spot missions, ad hoc meetings and nature dialogues will be held to discuss problems and solutions with authorities and stakeholders. Sixthly, a peer-to-peer support mechanism will help Member States’ authorities to learn from each other in terms of implementation on the ground. The final element is the update of the prioritised action frameworks, which identify the financial needs related to species protection, including for damage prevention, mitigation and compensation, in view of the upcoming EU financial perspectives for the period 2021 to 2027. The updated guidance document I mentioned is a work in progress. It is being drafted in very close cooperation with Member States and with stakeholders. After a first round of consultations, a second draft is currently being prepared and will be subject to a new round of consultations in the coming months. The updated guidance aims to deliver on the commitments in the Nature Action Plan to ensure clarity and consistency in the interpretation of the Habitats Directive, taking into account the recent case law of the European Court of Justice. The Commission will not propose any new rules or legal obligations. The guidance document will provide the Commission’s view on interpretation of the species-protection provisions under the Habitats Directive. Honourable Members of the European Parliament are of course welcome to share their views on the draft guidance with the Commission. All these measures are aimed at helping national authorities and the relevant stakeholders. However, it is for the relevant national authorities to decide on the most appropriate measures in each case, in line with EU law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 180, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Esther HERRANZ GARCÍA", "mepid": "22418", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with the approval and implementation of, inter alia, the Habitat Directive, it was intended to improve the sustainability of Europe's natural ecosystems; endangered animal species could benefit from their actions.

The wolf, the bear, the lynx have seen its population improve. And now, for example, the wolf in Spain has even a favorable state of conservation in large territories. However, reality has shown that this directive is incompatible with traditional extensive grazing, which is precisely one of the activities in the rural world that we want and must protect. The damage to farmers is constant and the European Directive has not been accompanied by sufficient budgetary measures to alleviate the enormous losses they cause to cattle, sheep and goat farmers, and therefore these farmers are the most vulnerable species.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has We have discussed the issue of 'big prey' on several occasions in both the Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on the Environment. However, the people in the regions with wolf presence expect concrete action from politics. According to the study presented to the Committee on Agriculture, there are around 17 000 wolves living in Europe. Without regulation, as in Germany, for example, stocks double every three years. This means that by the end of 2019 we will have 34,000 wolves. Shepherds and farmers are tired of being held back with the eternally identical statements and endless debates about the favourable state of conservation. We have finally reached the point where flexible management, adapted to the actual real situation, must be made possible. To this end, we need a corresponding adaptation of the Habitats Directive in its infancy. The completely excessive protection of a single large carnivore must not be above the equal protection of many other species.  It is not only the grazing livestock farmers who are now – quite rightly – demanding more action.

What Parliament does, in short, is also to collect the contributions of prime ministers and heads of state who have appeared over the past two years and to try to offer what the proposal is, the scenario, in which Parliament feels mostly. The report actually describes a whole set of circumstances which force us to 'rethred Europe'. Firstly, because we recognize serious problems in the economic governance of monetary union; because we recognize the serious social effects of austerity economic policies, especially in southern countries; because we know that Brexit forces us to reflect on a europe that is likely to be different in the wake of the UK's withdrawal; because there have been significant inconveniences between different countries, especially in the area of migration policies; because new problems, such as internal security and external security , arising from the first of the problems of terrorist attacks, and the second of a very conflicted neighbourhood – force us to a new conception of European defence; because there have been many dysfunctions in the functioning of the Union in recent years. One way or another, what we come to say is that Europe needs to set up a roadmap. And what the report offers are some reflections, thick ideas. The first, for example: nationalism is not the solution. We are all too small in the European Union to face the great challenges and this is a common denominator of virtually every prime minister who has appeared here. And, in that sense, I would say that the European Parliament's bet is Mr Juncker's fifth scenario: to do more together. I'd say: do better what we can only do together. A second line of reflection, no doubt, is that integration, a better integration, has to overcome several problems that have been detected as structural. For example, unanimity for certain issues: taxation, foreign policy, etc.; the timid use of enhanced cooperation; the temptation of many states to abuse the right to an 'A la carte Europe'. And so we could continue with dysfunctions that have to be resolved in the coming months. The Commission must regain political initiative, because we believe that the European Council has regained too much power imbalance during the crisis. A more agile, more political Commission; more power to Parliament, with the right of initiative, with the Spitzenkandidaten as a fundamental rule of connection between elections and the presidency of the Commission itself; more control of the Commission. In short, ladies and gentlemen, what this is about is establishing great lines for better integration, to do better what we can only do together.

I believe that, if that summit is to be held in multi-ethnic Transylvania, then these results must be truly visible and felt by indigenous national minorities. Siam was once one of the centres of the German minority in Transylvania, which has hundreds of thousands of people, and unfortunately only a few thousand Germans now live in Romania. At the same time, the Hungarian community in Transylvania has one million300,000 people and expects Europe to pay attention to the fact that it cannot use its symbols, that the state only provides the use of the mother tongue on paper, or that the future of medical training in Hungarian is in jeopardy.

We have to be clear that when we discuss the future of Europe we discuss whether and how we want the European Union to reaffirm its future in the world. If we want our Union to stay an actor in global politics in the 21st century, to maintain our economic strength, to defend our interests, and to shape foreign policy by projecting our European values of democracy, freedom, openness, solidarity, the rule of law and fundamental rights, then we have to do all what is necessary so that Europe has the internal legitimacy, capacity and means to do that. At his State of the Union address in this House in September last year, President Juncker presented to you his priorities and outlined his vision for how the European Union could devolve by 2025. On the same occasion, he presented a roadmap for a more united, stronger and more democratic Union. In particular, he called for confirming the process of the so-called spitzenkandidaten at European level, completing the governance of the euro area, and for a modern and values-based European budget for the coming years. In the longer run, the Commission’s take on the future of Europe is that we do not exclude treaty change. Today, however, we must not discuss treaty change but focus on concrete policies and on the immediate concerns of our citizens. This is what we are doing. The Commission has by now fully delivered on all the proposals needed to address its priorities. Together with you, the Members of the European Parliament, and the 28 Member States, we have adopted over the last four years, around 250 ambitious legal acts in the areas of investments in the real economy, the digital union, energy union, capital markets union, internal and cybersecurity, border protection, defence, economic and monetary union, trade, research and innovation, climate change, social solidarity, youth and employment. We are thus delivering concrete results that are to the benefit of all European citizens. As we meet today, our three institutions are working night and day to conclude important pending files, such as the European Border and Coast Guard, the prevention of terrorist content online, copyright and a series of contingency measures to mitigate the negative consequences of Brexit before the next elections. It is in all our interests to give it one last push and our joint efforts are already bearing fruit. The European Union is in the sixth consecutive year of economic growth. 239 million people in the European Union are currently in jobs. This is the highest number ever. With this, the European Union is on course to meet its Europe 2020 target of a 75% employment rate by 2020. Youth unemployment has fallen, down from 25% in 2013 to 15% overall, but remains far too high in some of our Member States. The EU is defending a rule and values-based multilateral order as just confirmed by the partnership agreements with Japan, which has just entered into force and which will generate new opportunities and growth both for Europeans and our partners. These results should inspire us to not let up because the task of building a more secure, sustainable and more prosperous and fairer Europe is far from over.  Steadying a confident and collective European course is the best response we can give to rising forces of illiberalism, nationalism and xenophobia and to fears of rising trade conflicts. On May 9 this year, just a few days before the elections to the European Parliament, the leaders of the European Union will meet at a summit in Sibiu, Romania, to reaffirm to European citizens and to the world, their commitment to a united, strong and democratic future of Europe at 27. Let us use this and any other opportunity to send strong and positive messages to our citizens. Let us not allow the doomsayers to weaken or paralyze our Union. Let us convince our citizens, so that at the next elections they will want to vote for a positive agenda, for stability, freedom and prosperity, for a Union that is united, strong and democratic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 206, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The debate is closed.

The chances of re-dynamising European integration, in addition to the major global economic, social and environmental challenges, are now under increased threat from the rise of anti-EU nationalism and populism in Europe, even by some national governments and leaders. As a glaring example, the Orban government is now provocatively weakening the FUNCTIONING of the EU by denying our Democratic Values in Europe by undermining migration policy or a common foreign and security policy. That is why I support all the institutional and political reform proposals that have been formulated so far in our debate on the future of integration to help curb these dangerous political aspirations: citizens' trust, democratic participation, the more efficient, transparent, democratic functioning of the Union, social justice, solutions to prevent the break-up of the EU - if necessary, even treaty change. I consider it particularly timely to apply the Community method and qualified majority decision-making in general, to make the EP election more open and direct, or to strengthen Parliament's role in order to counteract the often deliberate indecision of the EiT. As a Socialist politician, of course, I urge the creation of the political and institutional guarantees necessary for the realisation of the historical task of Social Europe and for the effective functioning of the Social Pillar.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 208, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The next item is a short presentation of the report by Ashley Fox, on behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, on a comprehensive European industrial policy on artificial intelligence and robotics (2018/2088(INI)) (A8—0019/2019).", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 209, "date": "2019-02-11.json", "name": "Ashley FOX", "mepid": "96957", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I was pleased to see this report adopted in Committee last month and I thank my shadow rapporteurs for working with me to produce a good result. This report sets out Parliament’s position on artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics.  Members may not be aware that Parliament originally agreed we should do a report on this subject in April. We spent the next six months arguing over who should be the lead committee, so work only started in October. This then left us only four months to write the report and bring it to plenary. That was a shameful waste of time. If there is one lesson I have learned from this process, it is that Parliament should rethink how we deal with these situations. We’ve had to work at great speed, and I’m glad that we’ve been able to get a substantial report through within such a short time frame. I wish to record my thanks to my assistant, Lavan, for his hard work.  My main objective has been to ensure that this is a positive report that signals our willingness to adopt this technology and provide the correct conditions for it to thrive. We are at the beginning of seeing the adoption of AI and it will take many years before we see its full potential and reap the full benefits of it. It can make us more prosperous, healthier and create jobs that currently don’t exist. An example that I have used throughout discussions on this file is that it took the best part of 200 years for humanity to reach the full potential of the steam engine. Along the way there was great resistance and I have no doubt there’ll be opposition to the adoption of AI.  There is, of course, always opposition to change, but let us not stand in the way and be a Parliament of Luddites. In the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), we agreed on the need for a code of ethics to guide the development of AI. This should encourage the good actors and deter the bad ones. Working under such a code and ensuring transparency will ensure greater acceptance of this technology. We believe that AI should have a human-centred approach. What is meant by this is that the use of AI should augment human capabilities rather than just replace them. It is sometimes forgotten that when AI and human abilities are combined, they are more powerful than when used in isolation. This has been demonstrated particularly well in the medical field.  It is important that we prepare society for the changes ahead through developing education and training. As AI progresses, it will destroy some jobs and create others. We need to ensure that we have a skilled workforce to take advantage of the new opportunities. This will be one of the most important aspects of ensuring competitiveness on a global scale.  We should recognise that most of the investment in this field will come from the private sector, not the state or the EU. Our Member States must work hard to ensure that they are attractive places to invest.  One final point I wish to make is that artificial intelligence does not have borders. It will operate between and across the different jurisdictions of the world. We should therefore approach its governance with a global mindset. We must ensure that the EU and our Member States discuss this at an international level, and as far as possible develop global standards.  I look forward to hearing what colleagues have to say this evening and to a positive vote tomorrow.

AI and robotics have great benefits to offer to improve quality of life. For example, precision farming promises to drastically reduce the need for pesticides and AI can also help to greatly improve cancer treatments and save lives thanks to early diagnostics. We welcome in particular that the report addresses all the key aspects, namely, that it is essential to ensure the EU's competitiveness by boosting its research and industrial capacity in AI and to promote the uptake of AI across the economy. That it is necessary to prepare for the socio-economic changes brought about by AI, in particular regarding skills, jobs and social protection. And that we have to ensure an appropriate ethical and legal framework based on the Union's values and in line with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU. The Commission is very pleased that Parliament shares their vision on the development and deployment of human-centric AI and acknowledges the importance of achieving ethical and trustworthy artificial intelligence – the trademark for AI made in Europe. Concerted EU action is also essential to avoid the fragmentation of the overall legal and ethical framework, and it is important that all stakeholders are represented in the process.  I am glad to know that we share the understanding that without sufficient funding, Europe will not be able to regain leadership in AI. Increased funding will be of crucial importance to the digital Europe programme and Horizon Europe, accompanied by the development of a public-private partnership in AI. We should make every effort to realise the promise potentially illustrated in the report for important sectors such as healthcare, energy, transport, agri- food, cyber-security and in the public sector, increasing productivity and competitiveness as well as quality of life at work and at home. The Commission appointed a high-level expert group on AI to draft ethics guidelines covering issues such as fairness, safety, transparency, democracy, personal data protection, dignity, consumer protection and non-discrimination.  The group should finalise its work in the course of March, and the guidelines are expected to be published in early April.  It is encouraging to see the support of Parliament to build on this work for an inclusive and ethical development in the use of AI. Parliament welcomes the creation of the expert group on liability and new technologies. While you regret that no legislative proposal was put forward during this legislature, you will understand that the substance is very complex. That is why the Commission will put forward a report in early summer outlining the broader implications for potential gaps in, and orientations for, the liability and safety frameworks for AI.  We have to build on our own strengths and support the European entrepreneurial spirit. We must be fully engaged and ensure broader and easier access to services for citizens and industry and address socio-economic and legal issues, building on European values. A united and value-based approach to AI will make the European Union a leader in AI and help promote ethical principles worldwide. And this concerted effort is necessary to ensure that European citizens and the economy can reap the benefits such technology has to offer. In conclusion, the European Parliament is uniquely placed in this mission, in particular in informing about the benefits AI can bring while carefully addressing the risks. The Commission is delighted that it can count on the support of Parliament to actively contribute to developing and implementing the comprehensive European industrial policy on AI and robotics. AI can improve quality of lives, greatly contribute to our economic growth and our environmental sustainability.  Let us not miss these opportunities.

We can only speculate where Artificial Intelligence (AI) will be in 10 or 20 years. Yet this is not something new – for instance, who knew 10 years ago what a data scientist would be? What is certain though is that the ever-changing digital world will significantly affect our lives. While previously, advances in automation focused on particular industries, like manufacturing, today automation influences all sectors. Automation is the new reality in the workplace and in the forthcoming years we will observe a growing interaction between humans and machines. Research shows that for the past 140 years automation, robots and technology have created more jobs than they have destroyed.
