Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we are writing a beautiful page of this European Union of ours, and I wanted to thank all the people who have worked on this result straight away, starting with our fellow rapporteurs, but also the whole Parliament, which has demonstrated with its flexibility, its ability to look at what was the concrete purpose of this mechanism. , of this strengthening of the European civil protection mechanism, has also managed to overcome some of the reservations and delays of some States that were a little concerned and saw this strengthening of civil protection as a kind of interference by the European institutions. This sensitivity is very different and distant from that of the citizens, who, with Eurobarometer, continue to say that civil protection wants it and want to see Europe and the European institutions by their side when they are facing a disaster that their local and national authorities cannot deal with on their own.  Experience has told us that this is the case. Unfortunately, we saw with the fires, especially in the summer in Portugal and Greece, where we suffered the loss of hundreds of human lives, in addition to the enormous economic damage, that Europe, despite having already had a civil protection mechanism, was unable to deal with multiple disasters at the same time.  And here we say today that we managed, just over a year after the Commission's communication – and I thank Commissioner Stylianides for that – to have the instrument we needed, we have RescEU. What Is RescEU? It is a new instrument that will consist of additional resources compared to those already existing and already belonging to the Member States, because the purpose of rescEU is precisely to strengthen and strengthen the response capacity where necessary.  Of course, it is not only this, because prevention and preparation are being strengthened, there is a European Union that stands shoulder to shoulder with its states to help them deal with disasters, whether they are natural or, as might unfortunately be the case, also accidents that also have to do with chemicals, biological, radiological and nuclear. I would like to point out that fire prevention is also something that is very good for the environment, because there are studies showing that fires cause 20 % of CO2 emissions in the world. So there are many aspects that we touch on with this strengthened mechanism. Let me also remind you, as an Italian, of a person who left us on 26 January last, Giuseppe Zamberletti, who for us Italians is the father of Italian civil protection, and somehow, in a translational sense, he also becomes a bit of the father of European civil protection. I would like to dedicate this day, this work, to him, if You will allow me, Commissioner, and since we have also set up, in addition to a kind of Erasmus – because it is important that the cooperation that already exists between the States is even more widespread and that there is a common European training standard, so this will also be an important tool – recognition for the people who will have , in the various countries of the Union, which are distinct from civil protection, I would not mind if we could begin by giving this great man this role. He never lacked his advice and support, and I think from heaven up there today, he also gives us a smile for this great achievement for all of us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Željana ZOVKO", "mepid": "185341", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the DEVE committee. – Dear Chairman, Distinguished Commissioner, at the outset I would like to congratulate my colleague Elisabetti Gardini on a very well-developed report by the European Civil Protection Mechanism as well as the Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid and Crisis Management of the European Union, Christos Stylianides. In my role as rapporteur for the opinion on behalf of the Development Committee, I participated in the preparation of this report on supporting the mechanism in which I stressed the need to strengthen national civil protection capacities, and to complement instruments at Eu level in the case of Union civil protection mechanisms. The new mechanism should not act in isolation, but should rely on the strength of other European instruments and focus on risk prevention. Faced with fires in the south of Europe, we could not remain passive. With extensive material damage and human casualties and numerous shortcomings in existing disaster mechanisms, we had to react.  I would like to point out that the report introduced a provision that allows Member States that are not able to participate in the pooled civil protection capacities, a co-financing rate not higher than 55 % of eligible transport costs, which is extremely important for the Republic of Croatia. Croatia is a crisis point bordering the rest of Southeast Europe and should be seen with special attention when allocating funds, so the focus should be on stepping up all preventive measures.  The adopted amendments in the Commission allow for the power to deploy Rescue capacity, while operational control in crisis areas remains under the control of Member States. I thank, the Chairman, and I thank once again all those who worked that this mechanism, which is the most beautiful thing we could do for the citizens of the European Union, gets its full strength and that citizens do not feel isolated, wherever they are.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I addressed this House a little more than a year ago to present our proposal, these proposals, to strengthen our European Union Civil Protection Mechanism. Today, after a year, Parliament is voting for the most ambitious European civil protection system that ever existed. And today, Parliament is voting for something that was really politically unthinkable a few years ago. Among friends, I have to be frank. It was really a very difficult and demanding job to persuade our Member States to accept this upgrade, but, at the end of the day, we managed together to get this very ambitious common purpose. Today, I am proud of being a European citizen. I would like to express, first of all, my sincere gratitude to the rapporteur, Elisabetta Gardini, for her leadership, and of course my thanks to all colleagues, my dear colleague Željana Zovko, my dear colleague Fernandes and all other rapporteurs from all political groups, and of course my thanks go to the parliamentary groups and to the European Parliament that supported overwhelmingly this ground-breaking initiative. Dear colleagues, with your political support, rescEU will be a reality ahead of the next forest fire season. And this is also thanks to your dedication to our common goal: to protect our citizens, to save lives and to save their livelihoods. You rightly insisted on a guarantee to have more disaster response means available immediately. Today, I can tell you this: we are working closely with our Member States to set in motion as soon as possible the so-called ‘rescEU transition phase’, so that disaster response capacities can be in place to respond to possible forest fires in Europe already this year, in 2019. The feedback from Member States so far is positive and I would also like to thank them here today for their positive approach.  Let us have no illusions. Natural disasters will not stop. On the contrary, they will become more frequent and more intense because of climate change. It is not fake news. It is happening now and we have to deal with this new phenomenon due to climate change. What we aim to do with rescEU is to better equip ourselves to face these disasters due to climate change. Dear colleagues, with this new legislation we are also putting more emphasis on prevention, on preparedness. The European Parliament made it very clear that this was a priority, and we have done our best to put in place a system that offers more support to Member States to exchange information and learn from each other. Today, modestly, we mark the beginning of a new era for European civil protection. This is about a Europe that protects. We owe this, as I said, to our citizens.

However, in our case, their anxiety about better protection from natural disasters has been the driving force in our efforts to make the European Civil Protection Mechanism a real tool of solidarity by creating the rescEU. Today, the humanity and support of the least powerful and environmental morality are winners. The reason for this proposal was the devastating fires in Portugal. But no one could have imagined that, just before the negotiations began, a new tragedy would struck Europe, this time in Mati, just outside Athens, with over 100 dead.  These events have made it clear to everyone that we must offer a meaningful response to citizens' concerns. In increasing natural disasters due to climate change or insufficient preparation by national authorities we do not remain observers, but we give a strong response. Together, with more organization, we can achieve more than anyone on their own. The road to political unification is long and full of the obstacles put by the devotees of a Europe in which solidarity is not an end in it own right, but an instrument at a cost that they do not want to bear.  The European Civil Protection Mechanism is a prime example of practical solidarity between Member States. We are creating the rescEU, a European pool of instruments, such as fire helicopters and planes, which will be bought with European funding for 80 to 90% of the total costs, ensuring that no country is left helpless again. At the same time, for the first time, up to 75% of European funding is available for the maintenance of national instruments. This assistance to countries such as Greece, where the inability to repair due to the economic crisis has severely limited the action of national instruments, is necessary.  Finally, we are strengthening prevention by keeping the characteristics of solidarity unadulted. We rejected the Council's proposal to introduce penalties for countries that often call for the mechanism to be activated. On the contrary, we give the Commission the power to examine the preventive measures of the State concerned and, where necessary, to intervene and to make recommendations to improve or strengthen national protection plans.

Disaster prevention has also fallen short of what was desirable.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I was very pleased to hear everyone's speeches, the confirmation of a unity of purpose and cooperation between all the political groups and all the very important Members.

We have done so much on the road, and that makes me optimistic, and I would like to thank the Commissioner, who also mentioned the efforts to convince some States.  There is also a kind of cultural modesty, let's say, in accepting that we need to be helped. I would like to remind you of the lesson we had unfortunately learned when Japan faced the Fukushima disaster: the country that was considered the most prepared in the world, was not ready to deal with that huge catastrophe. So there doesn't have to be this modesty. The Europe it protects, the Europe it protects, is an increasingly strong reality, because thanks to the Proposal of the Commissioner and the work of Parliament, and also of the Council, we finally have an instrument that makes this Europe safer. I am glad that we have also had the opportunity to implement this transitional period, which will allow us to be ready before next summer, because we have seen that the greatest disasters, those which have unfortunately recorded the number of incalculable human losses, take place during the summer with forest fires.

Civil protection has many forms – that is why we were unable to write the definition of civil protection during the last parliamentary term – but unity of purpose and feelings is the same and will certainly be an important brick in founding the Europe that we like, precisely the Europe that protects, protects, a Europe of solidarity alongside its citizens.

As you mentioned, Jytte can’t be with us this morning, but I would like to acknowledge the great work she did, together with all her colleagues and the shadow rapporteurs, precisely on this matter. Colleagues, I am one of those who strongly believes that today's intensive pesticide use around Europe is no longer sustainable. The unsustainable use of pesticides poses a challenge not only to our environment, but also to people's health, and it can have a serious impact on both the farmers who use such products and the general public who can come into contact with hazardous chemicals found in pesticides in public areas such as parks and also school-yards. Now the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive provides for a range of actions that can help Europe achieve a sustainable use of pesticides. But it is amply clear that Member States are not implementing this legislation in the proper manner. Instead, we are seeing a situation where the use of pesticides in Europe has been steadily increasing, since the 1990s. And funnily enough, despite awareness around the sustainability of agriculture and despite the development of pesticides that can be used at low doses, on average, we are seeing the use of pesticides has not decreased at all in recent years.  Whilst some progress was registered vis-à-vis checks on spraying equipment and in developing training courses and certification schemes on how to best spray pesticides, little progress has been made in promoting the uptake of alternative techniques.  Moreover, there is a lack of clear and quantifiable targets in the different Member States’ national action plans and most of these plans do not specify as yet how the targets or objectives are to be achieved. We strongly feel that progress is also lacking in the field of integrated pest management.  Now, we need Member States to take this seriously, because European citizens are getting increasingly concerned and want dependency on pesticides to decrease.  Europe's farmers have every right to be able to use substances and techniques that do not put their own health at risk and that do not impact negatively on the environment and their farmland. We need incentives that can change things, incentives that can help farmers reduce the amount of pesticides they use and switch to more sustainable non-chemical options. For the S&amp;D Group it is a priority that the European Union and all its Member States increase their efforts to help the sustainable use of pesticides. We need to continue working tirelessly to create non-toxic environments where we ensure that human health and ecosystems are fully protected against the impact of today's wide use of pesticides.  We have the tools. Now we need to make sure that Member States deliver, so that farmers, consumers, citizens and the environment, can all benefit from the existing sustainable alternative methods.  A better implementation of the Sustainable Use of Pesticides Directive is key in ensuring that this change actually happens.  Finally, I know that there was very good cooperation between the responsible shadow rapporteurs, and on behalf of Jytte, I would like to thank all the colleagues from the different political groups for their constructive approach and valuable support for Jytte’s work. Later on today, we as parliamentarians have the opportunity to send a clear and important signal to all the Member States, that we stand together with all citizens across the European Union and expect our countries to ramp up their actions and contribute concretely to a more sustainable use of pesticides around Europe.

It is clear that we can use pesticides more sustainably and it is also clear that farmers are the main ones interested in maintaining a clean and sustainable environment. Your livelihood depends on it. I therefore regret the general tone of this document which attributes to agriculture the main cause of the misuse of these products, when we know that their use is widespread by professionals and non-professionals also from other sectors. Climate change is triggering the emergence of new pests that must be tackled and thus protect our plants and productions. The way is not to eradicate pesticides, but to focus on the greater number of available low-risk active substances and the selectivity of the administration of these products. I again argue that the European Union has the safest agri-food system in the world and that in the most recent studies 97.2% of agricultural product samples have waste values well below the legal limit.

I welcome your own—initiative report, which will make a valuable contribution to our ongoing work on this very important topic. I want to start by stressing that we share common concerns and common goals – to protect citizens’ health, to safeguard the environment and to protect animal health – and we share these goals with Europeans, who are becoming increasingly interested and engaged in how we produce food and want to ensure this is done in a sustainable way. This is very much the debate at the moment. Let me remind all of us that the European Union has a comprehensive package of legislation to regulate plant protection products. To place a product on the market, the relevant active substance must first be approved at EU level – the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and so on – and then the product, the so—called concrete pesticide, must be authorised at Member State level. This is a rigorous and extensive process to demonstrate that products can be used in a manner which is safe for humans, animals and the environment. Nonetheless, as your report identifies, European citizens demand more. This is why the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides was developed. It requires Member States to adopt national action plans outlining their quantitative objective: targets, measures and timetables to reduce the risks and impacts of pesticide use on human health and in the environment. The Commission has evaluated these national action plans. It summarised its findings in a report to the European Parliament and Council in 2017. You know that. This report concluded that, while national action plans represented a significant step towards the sustainable use of pesticides, there were also significant gaps in many, many areas. It indicated that Member States needed to improve the quality of their plans. Primarily, they need to establish specific and measurable targets and indicators as part of a longer-term strategy to reduce the risks and impact of pesticide use. The report also notes that, although integrated pest management is a cornerstone of the Directive, Member States have not set clear targets in this area or ensured its implementation. It is clear that we need to do more. Let me assure you that I will not stop asking Member States to do more in implementing this Directive. My services are engaged in a series of actions to ensure this takes place. Following the evaluation of the national action plans, my services wrote to all Member States detailing their weaknesses and inviting them to address these in the revision of their plans. The Commission has also conducted audits in Member States to verify that the Directive is being fully implemented. These audits serve two purposes. First, they are a tool to share good practices amongst Member States. Secondly, where Member States have not met their obligations under the Directive, they will help the Commission to consider further actions based on their concrete findings. I am pleased to report that last month, Member States voted in favour of a Commission implementing directive to establish harmonised risk indicators. This will show trends in the risks associated with plant protection products. This implementing measure is now subject to scrutiny by the Council and the European Parliament – by you. I encourage you to look upon it favourably. I expect that these indicators will be calculated and published by the end of 2019. However, I should stress that I do not see the two indicators established under this Directive as the end of a process. Rather, they are the start of a more comprehensive suite of indicators to reflect trends in the risks associated with plant protection products throughout the EU. Integrated pest management is a cornerstone of the Directive. As you have noted in your report, Member States to date have not converted integrated pest management principles into prescriptive and assessable criteria to monitor compliance. I am pleased to inform you that my services are organising a workshop in May to develop a toolbox to help Member States to check implementation of this essential element. Your report also notes the importance of low—risk active substances to achieve more sustainable agriculture. It is thanks to the combined efforts of the Commission, EFSA, Member States and industry that the number of low—risk active substances continues to increase. These substances give farmers a tool to control pests while producing high—quality food in a more sustainable manner. While their adoption may not reduce the total quantities of plant protection products used, they have a more favourable toxicological profile. This will certainly help reduce the risk associated with these products. I also share your view that the sustainable use of pesticides should be integrated into the common agricultural policy. You will have noticed that such provisions were included in the Commission’s proposal, and I would encourage your support. Finally, five years have passed since Member States adopted their first national action plans. They are now obliged to review and revise them where necessary. My services will present a second report to the European Parliament and Council on the implementation of the Sustainable Use Directive later this year. It will analyse the revised national action plans and determine if weaknesses have been addressed. It will also summarise the experience gained by Member States in implementing the national targets to reduce the risks and impacts of pesticides. Honourable Members, thank you once again for your report. I think we can all agree that the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides is an important part of a broader sustainable agriculture policy. Two weeks ago we adopted a reflection paper on progress towards a sustainable Europe by 2030. It notably called for a genuine change in the way we produce, transform, distribute and consume food. The full implementation of the Directive on the sustainable use of pesticides would very much help in this respect. I can assure you that my services will look very closely at the recommendations listed in your report. In many areas, as you have just heard, the Commission has already taken action to address the issues raised. We are committed to ensure the full implementation of the Directive and we will continue to work with Member States so that this objective is achieved.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 27, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Thank you, Commissioner.

In this context, I am a little sorry that the Commission has not heard this Parliament's request to speed up the approval of biological and low-risk pesticides, which is probably what awaits us in the next period. In Europe, we talk a lot about security today, while we put a time bomb in our countryside every day that is going to go off around us and explode sooner or later. No wall or borders can protect us from it. Let us finally accept that the current way of farming is unsustainable in the long term.

Thank you, Chairman. Dear Commissioner, this report on sustainable crop protection devotes a great deal of attention to integrated crop protection. I think this is important, because integrated crop protection is the result of preventing the occurrence of diseases and pests in crops. What emerges in the report is that the countries of the European Union are being fingered because they would not do enough. I would also like to point the finger at ourselves, because many European rules make integrated crop protection difficult. Let me give you a few examples. First, breeding. It is extremely important that we grow new crops that are more resilient to diseases and various pests. The breeding sector is very much on the move and there are several innovations to improve this breeding. Unfortunately, European laws and regulations do not allow these new innovations. A second point that is very important is soil health. I think it is ridiculous that the European Nitrates Directive encourages the use of fertilizers at the expense of the use of animal manure. Thirdly, initiatives are being taken in several countries, including the Netherlands, to improve soil quality – in mind the Veldleeuwerik Foundation – but these are not given enough space by the rigid greening measures in the current common agricultural policy. Furthermore, a poor and outdated authorisation procedure makes the authorisation and use of micro-organisms and low-risk agents more difficult. And finally, we should pay much more attention to precision farming in order to be able to detect diseases and pests more quickly and to be able to tackle them more adequately and precisely.

Thank you, Chairman. Sustainability and pesticides, that are actually two words that do not belong in one sentence. Poison is not sustainable. Poison that was used in our grandparents' time is still in our environment, on our food and in our bodies. Agricultural poison pollutes our waters, it pollutes the soil, it poisons our health and affects biodiversity. A new study, published in the Journal of Biological Conservation, shows that 40% of all insects are threatened with extinction. Bees, butterflies and beetles are on the danger list. The disappearance of these insects, in turn, has a major impact on the rest of the biodiversity and all the animals that eat these insects. Think of meadow birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians and bats. The main cause of all this is the way we produce our food. Industrial intensive agriculture is destroying our ecosystems, the same research concludes. The use of agricultural poison is explicitly cited as one of the main causes of biodiversity loss. The question is therefore not how poison can be used sustainably. The question is how to shift to safe and truly sustainable production methods: organic production without agricultural poison. The current agricultural policy is still very far from that.

What we need to look at is an exit scenario for pesticides. Commissioner, you were right to point out that the Member States should actually be supplying reduction plans for pesticides. Has anything happened? No. Quite the opposite. Only two Member States fulfil their reporting obligation at all and make reduction plans. What are the Member States doing instead? As my colleague said, neonicotinoids are used in a number of Member States, although there is a European ban. This is untenable. This is actually the scandal where I have to say: is this legislation worth anything if there are Member States that simply ignore it?  We still have a discussion about glyphosate and we will continue to have it. What conclusions do we draw from this? Yes, it would have to be reduced – but the use of glyphosate is still increasing in some Member States, although there are alternatives. After all, organic farming makes it possible to do it without chemicals. Glyphosate e.B. is dispensed with. We would simply have to resort to mechanical methods. We must make decent crop rotations. That would provide us with solutions. But it is not practiced because, on the other hand, there are, of course, powerful interests, an industry that wants to continue to sell pesticides and thus does very good business. That has to be made clear here. Yesterday, another study was published which shows that the decline in species is really dramatic. There is no time left to think about whether we are lowering a little somewhere. No, we have to get out. We cannot wait for more than 70% of the insects to disappear. This is an ecological disaster that is taking place out there.  The European Union must give answers and, unfortunately, it does not. That is why we do not need to talk about the little things, about precision farming; this is not a solution. This is basically a bit better technique.

In fact, tying the target on reducing the use of pesticides is not the model for implementing the CAP.

I am convinced that the responsible use of plant protection products must be the benchmark. The magic word here is innovation. New, more efficient and low-risk substances and products will promote the sustainable use of plant protection products. Training is the second important key.

The main thing, as we all know, is that we need to strengthen our efforts in the sustainable use of pesticides and in the improvement of the Directive. Let me react to some specific points. I fully agree with Karl-Heinz Florenz when he raises questions about training. Especially now, as we see a lot of new agro—techniques, we need to encourage Member States to pay more attention to training needs when farmers are using new techniques and facing new issues with pesticides. Regarding derogations, derogation should mean derogation, and should not be the rule. The Commission is looking at this very carefully and we are now introducing strong measures, asking Member States for justifications and asking them to see what they can do and how we can regulate. As you know, we have permanent conversations with some Member States about derogations. But, of course, derogation is enshrined in law, so we need to pay greater attention to that. Some speakers mentioned the possibility of promoting more low—risk pesticides. As you know, we now have to hand a lot of improvements, and rules and procedures allowing the quickest possible authorisation of low-risk pesticides. Some speakers mentioned once again the role of organic farming and the message that organic farming is farming without chemicals. No: we know very well that in organic farming too people use certain chemicals. Copper sulphate is a very difficult question. You know that the carcinogenicity of copper sulphate is a big challenge and we need to address those issues. So do not mislead people. We know very well that different types of farming are using different methods, including chemicals. So do not simply create confrontation between conventional farming and organic farming. Once again, please tell the truth to society. From a regulatory point of view, we know what that is. We know who is who, and how different tools are used in different types of farming. Mr Andrieu rightly mentioned the Bee Guidance Document. We did not achieve a qualified majority on this at Standing Committee level because Member States are not capable of voting in favour. It’s now up to Parliament and the Council to conclude the so—called first reading on the comitology rules. We have proposed introducing transparency in risk management, changing the situation, with regard to the comitology rules, so as to have data publicly available to vote on. However, two years for the first-reading stage is not progress! May I encourage you once again to draw attention to this, because I am very happy that yesterday we concluded the General Food Law trilogue. I would like to thank Ms Ayuso for doing a very difficult job. We now have more transparency in the assessment of pesticides, and this is a big achievement for all of us.  I have outlined to you the comprehensive regulatory system for plant protection products in Europe and the Commission’s efforts to ensure their sustainable use. I also acknowledge that there is no perfect system. Ms D’Ornano mentioned cases of suicide in France. I was there, I met people and I discussed this with the French authorities. They should assess the situation in a very careful manner because it’s a complex one. Some use the word ‘poison’ when speaking about pesticides. I’m sorry, but sometimes, in some quantities, for some people, medicine is poison. So I would say, please, use the correct words and do not simply create rumours about pesticides.  The Commission is currently evaluating the implementation of the regulation that concerns the authorisation of plant protection products and the setting of maximum residue levels. It will also launch an evaluation of the Sustainable Use Directive in 2020 to determine if this legislation is fit for purpose. I call on the Member States to set ambitious targets, with clear timetables, in their revised national action plans. They must demonstrate their commitment to citizens to reduce the risk and impact of the use of pesticides on human health and the environment. Let me close by thanking the honourable Members for their interest in and support on this important issue. I look forward to the adoption of this important report by Parliament. Once again, I thank Jytte Guteland and the shadow rapporteurs for their very good, collaborative work and for this comprehensive report.

A very good morning to all of you, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner. If there is one area where Europe can prove its added value, it is the area of health care. It is often more obvious and cheaper for patients, especially in border regions, to get medical help where she is closest, namely in a hospital just across the border. This applies a fortiori to patients with chronic or rare diseases who can be helped more efficiently in another European country because they need specific treatment. Today, patients are all too often faced with all kinds of annoying obstacles when choosing treatment abroad. Often there is administrative nuisance in the way. It is unclear when they can be reimbursed for the treatment they receive abroad, and it is unclear what costs they will have to pay. We are 2019 and it is high time we stopped tolerating these unacceptable obstacles and obstacles for patients. The Cross-Border Health Directive, which we are talking about here, dates back to 2011. That was over eight years ago. This directive was certainly a step in the right direction, but implementation in the field leaves a lot to be desired. We can't accept that. The report we have written on implementation contains a number of concrete proposals. We have consulted very well with the Commission services on how to continue to do this and how we can improve implementation. The first assignment is: information to the patients. Most patients don't really know what their rights are and they don't know where to get information, despite the fact that each country has at least one national information point. That is why we propose to set up a one-stop shop in each country where patients can go for all the information in the areas of health care, health insurance, reimbursement, administrative conditions, etc. Patients are entitled to clear and clear information, including cross-border care. Today, after all, they are faced with a complex administrative tangle. And that could be much better. Hence the explicit demand that the Commission continue to monitor the application of this Directive every year and also maintain close contact with the European Parliament and national authorities. Secondly, for patients with a rare or chronic disease, the best and most specialised help may be abroad. That is why we want to strengthen the existing European reference networks (ERN's). And we want to combine european efforts and the efforts of all Member States to set up specialised centres in the existing health institutions where expertise on rare diseases is gathered so that patients with rare diseases can go there. Furthermore, digitisation of health care is an excellent tool for taking care of patients even better. The initiative launched by the European Commission last week to further strengthen the digital network of cross-border healthcare is a great initiative. We fully support that. We hope it will be rolled out as soon as possible. One more point, finally. We very much want a robust and independent health programme to be included in the multiannual programme, which is not the case today. Our citizens deserve the best health care, and it can sometimes be found on the other side of the border, with the neighbours. Thank you very much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 7, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 64, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Maria GRAPINI", "mepid": "124785", "text": "  Rapporteur for the opinion, the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection. – Madam President, Commissioner, as rapporteur for the opinion on this report, I certainly support the report and say that it is very important to see how this directive on cross-border healthcare applies in the Member States.

Let us not forget that there is a Eurobarometer study showing that less than 20% of European citizens know these rights. That is why, in the opinion of the IMCO Committee, we supported further measures to inform citizens, because it is very important to know their rights. It is also very important to have adequate funding and to maintain funding, as was the case in the third health package. Last but not least, I could say that what has been done is very important: the European health card, eHealth, it is very important. Also important are national information points for patients and, ultimately, the mobility of cross-border patients must be a real fact and not a theoretical one.

You know I am a medical doctor and for me it is very close to my heart.  Each year, millions of Europeans travel to other EU countries, safe in the knowledge that they can access healthcare if necessary. At the same time, other citizens are planning treatment in different Member States. Why? Because EU law guarantees the right to access healthcare across borders and the right to reimbursement in their home country. So it is safe to say that cross-border healthcare is an issue of high importance for European citizens.  In this context, I welcome Parliament’s draft report and motion for a resolution on the implementation of a Cross-border Healthcare Directive. Let me stress that we fully agree with you. Action is necessary to improve the implementation of the Directive. In fact, your draft report is very much in line with the conclusions of the Commission’s own report on the Directive’s implementation, which we published last September, as you know.  I want to take a few moments to touch on what we are doing to improve implementation. The Commission has examined the transposition of the Directive into national law. We took swift action when elements were missing and launched 26 infringement proceedings on account of late or incomplete transposition. The first phase is now complete and all infringements relating to this phase have been closed.  The Commission has now moved to an in-depth assessment of compliance, carefully examining measures put in place in each Member State. This approach is delivering results. Many Member States have already changed their legislation for the benefit of patients. But I want to assure you that the Commission will continue its intensive dialogue with Member States to achieve the best possible transposition of the Directive.  A directive allows Member States room for manoeuvre when it comes to transposition. Unfortunately, we have evidence of discrimination against EU citizens seeking treatment in another European Union country. Patients often face very complex administrative procedures ahead of planned treatment abroad. We are taking action to put an end to any unjustified practices. On 23 January, the Commission launched infringement proceedings against two Member States regarding national rules on reimbursement tariffs. In light of this, I welcome the draft report’s focus on the reimbursement schemes. We will now discuss with Member States ways to simplify procedures for EU patients in line with the Directive.  The Commission will also continue to address the lack of awareness when it comes to citizens’ rights. We also fully agree with the Committee’s recommendation that the Member States provide sufficient funding for their national contact points. I can assure the honourable Members that the Commission will continue to support the national contact points. A toolbox to support the national contact points’ work will also be made public in the near future. Our goal here is to improve national contact points’ effectiveness so that the information provided will deliver practical benefits to patients. Of course, the Directive also encourages cross-border healthcare cooperation between Member States, especially in the border regions. In this context, the Commission provides support for a European network of regional and local health authorities through its health policy platform. Here I want to highlight two important points made by your report. Firstly, on the establishment of 24 European reference networks, which represent a major achievement in the field of healthcare cooperation on rare diseases. But these networks are also facing challenges involving their integration into national healthcare systems. I am thankful for your call on Member States to support healthcare providers that are European reference network members.  Secondly, I want to echo your position on digital solutions. In fact, only last week the Commission adopted a recommendation on a European electronic health record exchange format. The recommendation aims to make it possible for people to safely access their health records across borders.  I am very pleased to see that Finland and Estonia have recently begun to exchange e-prescriptions thanks to the European Union’s work. This is a significant step forward and will increase accessibility to services for patients. Honourable Members, your draft report makes an important contribution to the discussion on cross-border healthcare. I look forward to your final report and I assure you that the Commission will examine each recommendation very carefully. Our convergence on this issue means that we can move forward together, deliberately. Ultimately, this cooperation will benefit citizens and health systems across the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 7, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 5, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 66, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Cristian-Silviu BUŞOI", "mepid": "38420", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, I would like to thank and congratulate colleague Ivo Belet on his report.

I tabled amendments and supported this directive, as an MEP, in 2010-2011, and then I had the chance to implement this directive in my country, Romania, as President of the National Health Insurance House in 2013-2014. Contrary to the objectives of the Directive, however, some Member States have adopted administrative measures that substantially block cross-border healthcare, such as reimbursement limitations or pre-authorisation requirements, some unduly complicated.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ivo Belet, for the very good cooperation. I believe that we all agree on the objective of this dossier: the best interests of European patients are paramount, and we want people to be able to be treated across borders. Unfortunately, the review of the current implementation has shown that cross-border supply is still not working properly. With the legislation on cross-border medical care, we really wanted to ensure that patients have access to high-quality and safe cross-border medical care and that the costs of treatment are then simply reimbursed. It is therefore disturbing, and it cannot be explained to any citizen or citizen, that 26 out of 28 Member States were so slow in implementing it that the European Commission had to open infringement proceedings. According to The Eurobarometer of May 2015, more than 20% of citizens did not even know that they had the opportunity to be treated across borders. So, two years after the directive came into force, almost no one knew his rights. Knowing his rights, however, is the basic prerequisite for being able to use them. In the area of health, the need for information is complex and, frankly, the current level is not satisfactory. National contact points in particular play a very important role here. These must be fully and, above all, comprehensible to everyone. A wide-ranging information campaign on the national contact points is therefore necessary for citizens. Obtaining accurate information is a prerequisite for the exercise of his rights. That is why we are right to call for this in the report. We also need more transparency and clarity for service providers in the interests of consumer protection. It is necessary to break down transparently which health services are offered and also reimbursed. The Commission's report has also shown that there is still considerable room for improvement in the reimbursement procedures. Let me make one final point: for my group, it is important that we also include vaccinations in the scope. The anti-vaccination is becoming more and more, and diseases that could actually be eradicated are coming back. This is a danger that we should no longer accept. That is why we should also supplement the report in this area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 68, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Urszula KRUPA", "mepid": "28334", "text": "  On behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab Cross-border healthcare could be a great opportunity for patients in situations of problems in the Member States, especially as, according to the Treaty, a high level of protection of human health is ensured. However, the organisation, financing and provision of healthcare is the responsibility of the Member States, which means that cross-border care opportunities are mainly used by patients from the border regions of the 'old' Union or sick people from rich countries travelling to poorer countries where the cost of treatment is lower, while central European countries fear excessive budget capacity or patients do not have money for expensive foreign treatment.  Of course, patients must be informed about the possibilities and rights of a regulation or directive through information points. However, cross-border care could be a great opportunity for patients with rare diseases, affecting around 6% of all citizens, where a relatively small number of patients suffer from each of these diseases. Cross-border cooperation should play a role in the collection of information to combat rare diseases, the possible establishment of specialised reference centres and the search for new medicines, as current prices prevent treatment.

But that’s why we also have the obligation to improve it and make it function properly when it doesn’t. One of the major areas in which we have to improve is the transparency of health care providers and how they function. If I didn’t know whether I would be reimbursed or what type of care I had a right to, I would never dare go to a hospital in another country.

For certain groups of patients, e.g. those with rare diseases, cross-border healthcare is simply the most appropriate and accessible care. I believe that the importance of sharing knowledge and resources needs to be constantly emphasised, particularly in the context of the treatment of rare diseases. Today, this issue is no longer easily solvable only at national level, but requires the involvement of material and mental resources across the EU. There is also a need for greater efforts in the area of mutual recognition of prescriptions from other Member States, reduction of administration and all artificial barriers to the reimbursement of cross-border care, greater use and use of the Insured Person's European Card and, last but not least, an increase in low patient awareness of the possibilities of using such care.  What I also welcome about the report is the call for greater unification of vaccination obligations across the EU. I believe that this is an extremely important step at a time when some regions are increasingly being destroyed by epidemics of diseases that we mistakenly thought were already eradicated. Last but not least, we must also address the negative externalities of cross-border care. I am talking again about the so-called parallel re-export of medicines.

The Eurobarometer clearly sets out how health is one of the main values for European citizenship. But we are also aware that health competences are divided, as well as the special connotations and sensitivity of the issue of health care. We have a directive, in my view, particularly ambitious; positive but, as I say, ambitious, the implementation of which has been uneven within the European Union by the Member States. I would like to begin by adding that, for the success of this directive, we first need a prior premise, which is a clear commitment on the part of the Member States to their public health systems, in order to strengthen them as guarantors of social cohesion. This Directive may never replace that necessary commitment of the Member States to their public health system. That is why I also believe that we should start implementing it step by step, objective by objective, and start with the European Health Insurance Card. We cannot detach cross-border health from harmonisation of this European Health Insurance Card, in order to avoid the discrimination that it entails today, and it should be made possible under the principle of universality, in which students, the unemployed, self-employed workers, all people, all European citizenship would have to be made possible. Secondly, the recipe, the recognition of the recipe. Thirdly, as the Directive points out and as one of the next objectives to be developed by the Commission with regard to digital health, I believe that Member States must be involved from the outset.

Dear! I am pleased that the European Parliament has taken up the subject of implementing the directive on cross-border healthcare.

This is a priority on which the EU institutions should work with Member States.

Let me repeat once again: now is a good time for all of us to have an awareness-raising campaign in the European Union because the European Parliament elections are ahead of us. Please, honourable Members, keep healthcare high on the agenda and please campaign on these issues, and I say that especially to those who are ready now to go and present their programmes to the public. Of course, I see a confrontation in terms of Member States’ understanding of what we call subsidiarity, and that is why we see such a low level of awareness. Mainly, if you ask Member States about healthcare and medical services, they will argue that these fall within national competences: ‘national competence’ has become a mantra. If you look just at health technology assessment, you will see, once again, resistance to doing more at European Union level in that area. Why? Because of a wrong understanding about subsidiarity. If you cannot offer people the chance of achieving the best possible healthcare, or a cure if they have some rare disease, then surely we should allow them to go across borders and achieve it in another country. How can we overcome the silo mentality? That is a question for all of us. It’s not just a matter of having templates and national contact points. It’s also about possibilities of changing the narrative, about understanding and about discussions with governments. I very much appreciate the fact that we share common goals when it comes to cross-border healthcare for European Union citizens. This convergence is crucial as we move forward and eliminate unjustified barriers to healthcare. The draft report outlines concrete measures around some of the directive’s major pillars in the areas of charging, reimbursement, access to and exchange of health data, administrative procedures and provision of information. There are many, many issues. Let me assure you that the Commission will carefully consider how to take this recommendation forward once the report has been adopted. I would like to stress once again that the Commission will take deliberate action wherever the spirit and letter of the directive is not upheld, and we strongly urge Member States to put in place measures to prevent discrimination among patients. In closing, I want to reiterate my thanks to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) for its work on this issue. In particular, I want to recognise the contribution made by the Environment Committee Chair, Ms Vălean, the Vice-Chairs, Mr Jávor and Ms Sârbu, and the rapporteur, Mr Belet, as well as the shadow rapporteurs.

On the final remark that has been made by Mr Marias, I would like to add that there are proposals to take vaccination on board of this directive and that the ECR Group of Mr Marias is objecting to that, so it would be useful to mention that. Dear colleagues, Commissioner, thank you for the input. I am convinced that we have broad support for this report for the implementation of the directive in a good way. Commissioner, I appreciate very much that you have referred to the fact that you will raise your efforts with regard to the simplification of the procedures on the one hand and secondly, also to strengthen the NCPs; the contact points, which is also crucial in this regard. We will support your efforts and I hope that everyone has heard your message, that indeed it is the role of the MEPs in the up-coming months to put it and keep it high on the agenda, not just in the election campaign, but also afterwards. It is indeed not our intention to stimulate patients to go abroad. On the contrary, in many cases, certainly in border regions, but also for patients with rare diseases or chronic diseases, a treatment in another country is often more effective and even cheaper and therefore the interests of our fellow citizens have to be our top priority. We have to make sure that Europe is at its best in serving the interests and the well-being of European citizens and these efforts — as has been said also by Peter Liese and others — do not cost money; it is about the correct implementation. So, let us use this instrument, this directive to prove that the extra value of European cooperation is really to be found here in this regard.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, First of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their contribution to the important debate on these months of work.  I would start from one fact: in 2017 alone, global water withdrawals were about 6 000 cubic kilometers, and it is estimated that they can double by the end of the century. It is clear that there is a problem of increasing global competition for the supply and use of water resources, which will have an effect on the economy, communities and ecosystems on which these communities depend.  On the one hand, therefore, the increase in demand and, on the other, the increasingly obvious effects of climate change present us with the possibility that areas with drought problems could increase. That is why the issue of proper and efficient water management is becoming increasingly pressing, which is rightly increasingly considered a precious but scarce asset.  Mind you: Europe is not an arid continent, but security of supply is currently a cause for concern for at least half the population of the European Union. Here too, forgive me if I give you any data. Water scarcity is already a phenomenon that already affects at least 11 % of the European population and 17 % of the territory of the European Union. Since 1980, the number of droughts in Europe has increased and worsened, with costs estimated at EUR 100 billion over the last thirty years.  The drought of the summer of 2017 alone has once again highlighted the scale of the economic losses we are talking about. These, as underlined by the Commission's impact assessment for the Italian agricultural sector alone, for example, amounted to around EUR 2 billion. This trend is set to continue. Water scarcity is no longer confined to a small number of areas of the continent, particularly in the South, but is a concern for the whole territory of the Union. It is up to us to find appropriate solutions at European level to maintain the well-being of our citizens and clearly preserve the environment.  The starting point must be to extend the principles of the circular economy, on which we have set the new model of development in Europe, also to water resources, primarily by promoting their savings and re-use through a specific legislative instrument capable of creating the regulatory stability that favours investment in this sector, which is very important in order to make the system more efficient. The Water Framework Directive already exists, which mentions the reuse of urban waste water as an additional measure for efficient water resource management.  However, we must be clear that there is a lack of precise legislation and clear rules in order to be able to take full advantage of the benefits of this activity. According to data provided by the European Commission, the total potential for water reuse by 2025 is 6.6 billion cubic meters compared to the current 1.1 billion cubic meters per year. These are impressive figures, which show us the potential that we have in front of us.  For this reason, the ENVI Committee supported the regulation by a very large majority, as proposed by the Commission and placed in the context of the circular economy action plan. The Commission's proposal aims to achieve the objectives of the circular economy by establishing harmonised standards at European Union level that create the same high food safety conditions for agricultural products marketed in the Union's internal market.  As the ENVI Committee, we have supported the Commission's general structure, which enhances the experience gained from specific national legislations such as the Italian, French and also the Spanish legislation. However, as a Parliament, we felt it necessary to take action with some changes to make this legislation clearer, in particular on the definitions, roles and responsibilities of the various actors involved and on the main risk management activities.  Turning briefly to the specifics, we considered it important to define more precisely the main actors involved in urban waste water recovery operations. For this reason, in addition to the treatment plant operator, the recovery plant operator and the end user, the distribution network operator and the recovered water storage operator are inserted.  With regard to the minimum requirements for reclaimed water, we shared the parameters proposed by the Commission, based on the JRC study, but we felt it was necessary to further include the 'salmonella' parameter in order to ensure even greater food safety for citizens.  Particular attention will also have to be paid to the need for awareness-raising measures that highlight, firstly, how important it is to save water use and, secondly, how the reuse of urban waste water does not harm human and animal health. With today's vote, Parliament will close its first reading. I am sure that the Council will soon be able to find a common position which will enable the new Parliament to open negotiations as soon as possible and see this important legislation adopted.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 92, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like, first and foremost, to thank Ms Simona Bonafè and the shadow rapporteurs for the very hard work done on the proposal setting minimum requirements for water reuse. The European Parliament’s work will be instrumental. It is very important in taking this important dossier forward in the forthcoming negotiations.  As Simona already mentioned, water is a very precious resource. It is indispensable for all of us, whether it’s for industry, for agriculture or the many other uses. However, it is also an increasingly scarce resource. Today, one-third of the European Union territory already suffers from water stress all year round. As the summer of 2018 has dramatically shown, water stress is becoming a concern for many Member States, even for those that are not usually associated with water scarcity, even Member States that are not even associated with drought. These problems are likely to worsen, mainly due to climate change. Together with water savings and water efficiency measures, water reuse can play an important part in addressing such problems, also, in the framework of the integrated water management policy.  The proposal on water reuse, which we are debating today, promotes treated urban wastewater as a reliable alternative water supply for agricultural irrigation. It seeks to extend the lifecycle of water, turning a waste product into a resource and is fully in line with the circular economy concept that this Commission is actively promoting. The objective is to facilitate the uptake of water reuse for agricultural irrigation wherever this is relevant, wherever this is safe and wherever this is cost effective, in order to alleviate water stress whilst preserving the health of consumers and protecting the environment.

Up to 6.6 billion cubic meters may be available if we can start using purified wastewater. For me, it is very important that we have good criteria to ensure food safety and public health. In the spirit of sustainability, It seems to me important to see if we can reuse residual flows, such as water, for example. In addition, there is another indirect effect, namely that there are already Member States using purified wastewater. In the context of the internal market, it is important that we have European rules for this. The products that these countries are already producing with this purified waste water are also in the supermarkets of other Member States which do not yet use purified waste water.

In 2003 alone, the drought caused the European economy losses of at least EUR 8.7 billion, and between the 1980s and 2000s the number of people affected by drought increased by almost 20 %, resulting in total costs reaching the astronomical figure of EUR 100 billion.  Not only, as my fellow Members have also said, this is happening in the dry season and in the Mediterranean countries, but the extreme drought, which is increasingly intensified by climate change, is increasingly affecting northern Europe as well. There is therefore no doubt that water as a common good and a valuable resource must be managed more efficiently and that water saving must become a priority at every level. That is why common rules to stimulate the reuse of water in the circular economy can only be welcomed, and the regulation on the reuse of water is therefore an opportunity that Europe must not waste. We participated in the definition of the minimum requirements for the quality of recovered water by emphasising the need to ensure their safe reuse. For us there must never be any risk to the land and crops, no room for microplastics and endocrine disruptors. We have proposed decisive action on this, because they should be absent, both from the waters that flow into rivers and seas, in order to put an end once and for all to the enormous damage to biodiversity that we are perpetrating globally, and of course to the reclaimed waters that are the subject of this regulation, so that their reuse can be allowed.

The reuse of recovered water properly treated for irrigation purposes must be respected for the environment and human and animal health. It is therefore clear that the water to be reused cannot lead to eutrophication of soils and groundwater and surface water, which would be disruptive to ecosystems and contribute to the reduction of biodiversity.

The Commission has closely followed the discussion and will examine in detail Parliament’s proposals with a view to the next steps in the legislative process. I would like, however, to make two or three points. With regard to the issue of polluted soil, we do have the Nitrates Directive to protect our soil, and the Commission is following the implementation of this directive very closely. It is, at least for me, hard to justify, or even to understand, how bad agricultural practices are still harming the very resources that sustainable agriculture depends on. Another point I would like to make is that I feel we are, at times, underestimating the problem when we say that the EU is facing water scarcity. It is the whole planet which is facing this problem, and that makes the necessity to act now even more urgent. With regard to the scope of the proposed law – whether it’s limited to agricultural irrigation – I would point out that, of the various possible areas for water reuse, agricultural irrigation is the most widely used worldwide. As demonstrated in the impact assessment undertaken, water reuse for agricultural irrigation also has great potential in the European Union but it is currently underutilised. While the Commission agrees on the desirability of using reclaimed water for other purposes, the proposed rules do not exclude the possibility of Member States’ using reclaimed waters for other purposes as well. We are confident that an agreement on the new rules can be found and that it will be possible swiftly to complete the legislative process for this very important proposal. Once it has entered into force, the new instrument will facilitate the uptake of water reuse, helping to fulfil the largely untapped potential of this practice and also to alleviate the pressure of abstraction on surface and groundwater bodies – thus benefitting farmers, consumers and the industry.

Specific resources dedicated to strengthening market surveillance and product safety activities, with particular attention to products that are sold online. And finally, the introduction of delegated acts for the implementation of the programme for a stronger role of control and supervision of the European Parliament.

Look, we’ve all voted on dozens, maybe hundreds, of these fisheries agreements with various African countries, and I have occasionally taken the opportunity to lament the fact that overfishing in Europe and the mismanagement of the common fisheries policy brought us to the point where we needed to do this.

Again, we are treating Côte d’Ivoire and the African continent generally as a kind of economic colony and a supplier of raw materials to our industries. Under EU tariff arrangements, you can export green coffee beans but not roasted coffee from Africa, you can export cocoa but not chocolate.

I think everyone here recognises the common fisheries policy over the years has been catastrophic for the European fishing industry, it has led to a collapse in stocks, it has led to unemployment, it has led to untold hardship.  Pushing control away from a centralised top-down approach to a regionalised approach has got to be the right idea.

It should be clear that the only sustainable way out is a negotiated solution under the auspices of the United Nations (UN), and we will not tire of repeating this. Carving out spheres of influence in a partitioned Syria will not bring peace, security and stability to the country and the region. The north-east of Syria is now the subject of negotiations between the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, the USA, Russia, Turkey and the Syrian regime. Daesh is not defeated yet and it’s essential to prevent terrorists from making a comeback in the future.  We fully understand the security concerns of Turkey, but we also believe they can truly be addressed only if the sovereignty and integrity of the Syrian state is preserved. We hope that any security arrangement for the north will ensure protection for people of all ethnicities and religions, and that it will prevent new suffering and clashes on the ground. In the meantime, the al-Qaeda wing in Syria, formerly known as the al—Nusra Front or Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) is consolidating its control over the Idlib area in the north-west of Syria. This development has forced us to put on hold as a precautionary measure all the Commission programmes brokered in Idlib province. The same happened in the south of Syria, where it was not possible to continue our work. Unfortunately, the needs are dire. The sole positive note is the recent humanitarian delivery in Rukban Camp on the Jordan border where 60 000 Syrians are stranded, including many women and children. Humanitarian organisations need access to the whole country. All the crossing-points towards Syria must stay open, in particular those located in the north-west and the north-east of the country. This is even more urgent during winter, and especially for the hundreds of thousands of displaced people in camps, many of whom are children struggling to survive. We will continue to protect civilians in the event of any offensive and to advocate for the protection of humanitarian workers. In areas controlled by the regime, we hear reports of arbitrary arrests and forced conscription. There has been no progress on the liberation of political detainees. Corruption is mounting, and the war economy is the main source of subsistence for some people. There can be no European contribution to the reconstruction of Syria so long as there is not a political transition firmly on the way. While the Syrian regime does not engage in the UN-led process, and for as long as human rights continue to be violated, this will not change. As to the return of Syrian refugees to their land, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) continues to tell us that the conditions for safe, voluntary, sustainable and dignified return are not yet in place. We also need a system to monitor what happens to returnees, to ensure their protection and to influence conditions for return. We won’t ask Syrians to go back to a place where they risk arbitrary detention, forced conscription and torture. For all these reasons, we continue to support the political process in Geneva as the only just and realistic way to end the war. We cannot afford simply to freeze the conflict. That would be the perfect recipe for more suffering, more radicalisation, more regional instability and more violence. High Representative Federica Mogherini is in close touch with the new UN Special envoy for Syria, Geir Pedersen, about how best to support him in his efforts. He is currently meeting all stakeholders in order to restart the Geneva process. And it is precisely to support the Geneva process that, in mid-March, we will co-host the third Brussels Conference on Syria, with the UN. The conference will focus on three pillars: support for the political process, humanitarian aid, and the regional development component. Our aim will be to ensure pledges to meet the continuing needs of Syrians and of the countries that have welcomed so many refugees. This year we will also host, at the European Parliament in Brussels, a day of dialogue with Ministers, international NGOs and civil society representatives from Syria, Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey. The people of Syria are asking for a sustainable solution to the war. They demand a country where every Syrian can find a place, beyond all differences of faith, ethnicity, politics and social background.

Yes, the Syrian-Russian-Iranian military alliance has retaken territories held by the opposition forces, including terrorist groups, but they have done so following attacks that involved indiscriminate air strikes and prohibited weapons. The war will end only when we find a way towards a genuine political transition, with full accountability and credible transitional justice; and when we can ensure that the six million refugees and the four million internally displaced Syrians will have a home to return to and will be protected by their state. Only then, can reconstruction start. Justice remains a key word. The Syrian conflict is marked by war crimes, ranging from systematic torture and detention by the Syrian security services, through the Government impeding humanitarian aid, to the consistent use of indiscriminate and prohibited weapons by the Syrian-Russian military alliance.

Those were the words of Josh Rogin in The Washington Post last week. He referenced the extraordinary evidence of the torture in Assad’s death facilities. A brave Syrian citizen called ‘Caesar’ smuggled exactly that evidence out at the risk of his and his family’s life. So now we must play our part, at last, because I agree with those who say that Europe is too much of a payer and not a player vis-à-vis the war in Syria, and it has to change, because we still lack a common EU strategy. And of course the sudden US change of direction in Syria has major consequences while ISIS is not defeated. And I hear a repetition of the words ‘no military solution to the war in Syria can be found’, but of course that doesn’t in and of itself change the fact that military moves do create realities on the ground that we must be realistic about. So I think we need to put pressure on the warring parties, particularly to protect civilians in and around Idlib, people who were forcibly displaced from other parts of the country in the first place; Aleppo and Homs now risk being trapped and targeted again.  We must also make sure that what we do in terms of adopting sanctions vis-à-vis Syria is also implemented. We have targeted sanctions, for example, to hold to account individuals without punishing the entire population, and we have to make sure that our broad package of sanctions is smart and that they are upheld. We heard of Belgian companies shipping tonnes of chemicals to Syria which may have been used to create weapons, and Italy rolled out the red carpet for Ali Mamlouk, a security official who is not supposed to enter the EU. We are not credible if we don’t live up to our own commitments.

Syria, which lost half of its Christian population during the war, ranks 11th in the disremity \"leaderboard.\" It is commendable that since the outbreak of war, the European Union has provided more than EUR 10 billion in aid to victims of the humanitarian disaster in Syria. However, it is a fundamental matter of principle that it is not enough to 'deal' with the perpetuated crisis, but above all to eliminate the causes of the crisis, namely the end of the war in Syria.  With regard to asylum, the Hungarian model is worthy of follow-up, according to which the best alternative to humanitarian aid is not only to take in hundreds of thousands of refugees, but also to repatriation. According to Viktor Orban, it is not the trouble that needs to be imported into Europe, but the help that needs to be taken where there is trouble.

The conflict in Syria has lasted eight years. Eight years! What began with peaceful protests for democratic values culled in one of the bloodiest wars in the world. There were – we all remember the images – deadly gas attacks and people were slaughtered all over the country. More than 465 000 Syrians were killed, one million were injured and some 12 million people – half the population – were forced to flee. Meanwhile, the chaos trumps in Syria. The Syrian government is still fighting the rebels today. Israel, in turn, is using its weapons against the Iranian-backed forces. And the U.S. is trying to defeat IS. In addition, there are Kurds in the north who in turn are affected by Turkish bombardment. And at that moment, President Trump announces that he is withdrawing his troops because IS has been defeated, although specialists are reporting otherwise. Commissioner, I sometimes have the impression that the European Union is doing the talking, as it is here in the Hemisphere today. We are talking about one of the bloodiest conflicts in the world, in which people are chemically bombed and children have been living hopelessly in camps for eight years. And yet nothing happens. There's hardly a cat here. You hardly see anyone when we debate such a conflict! I can only hope that the Commission will do something. I really hope there will be sanctions. I really hope that we will tackle the problem at its root. You know, Commissioner, we were both born in a country of peace. Kids there don't have that luck. Let us finally do everything we can, put our fist on the table and try to end that conflict. I don't have the solution, because then I gave them to you. But you in the Commission are smarter.

The European Union should lead political dialogue, multilateral negotiating frameworks, the promotion of international law, to end the Syrian conflict. It is essential that the Kurdish people can secure their social and political conquests, such as gender equality, by ensuring that they are not wiped off the map, now threatened by the entry of the Turkish army into Kurdish territory. And in the meantime, the European Union should break preferential agreements with its partner, such as Turkey, which shears the Kurdish population, even outside Turkey.

Commissioner, if we want to help the Syrians, we must be able to consider the return of Syrian refugees to Syria as urged by Lebanon, which bears the immense burden of 1.5 million Syrian refugees on its territory, and reconnect, whether we like it or not- once again - with Bashar al-Assad. Therefore, if we want to address the considerable danger that threatens the internal security of the European Union and that is the return of thousands of jihadists imprisoned in the jails of Kurdish fighters and the Syrian regime, who can at any moment be released and come to carry out attacks on the soil of the Member States of the European Union, already bruised by many terrorist attacks , we will have to deal with Damascus, whether we like it or not.

More Syrian people will be present, more civil society representatives will come to talk to the Ministers and international organisations about their dreams, their concerns and the future. This conference will last, altogether, three days. It will include two days of opportunities to meet politicians and to give politicians, and also ordinary citizens and civil society organisations, the opportunity to talk to each other, to exchange views and to look at what could be done in order to improve the humanitarian situation and to help people on the ground. In particular, we will look more closely at the question of women’s empowerment and at ways to alleviate the pain of the most vulnerable Syrians, while continuing our long-term investment and accountability and providing necessary support inside Syria and also outside it, in particular to the host communities which still have a considerable burden in dealing with the Syrian refugees.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank you for your work and your unwavering commitment to the European journey of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Here we are already presenting my fourth and final report of the current European Parliament, on the evolution of this country towards Europe. Having been on an upward trajectory since 2015, Bosnia and Herzegovina has been in a period of marked slowdown since 2017, as I know you are also concerned about it. When I became permanent rapporteur in 2014, my hope was that the country would be presented as a candidate country during this term. Despite our joint efforts to support Bosnia and Herzegovina, this goal has not yet been achieved. And in the run-up to the parliamentary elections on October 7, 2018, the old demons of political divisions and polarization on ethnic grounds have resurfaced. The country entered the campaign with a broken electoral law, several articles of which were invalidated by the Constitutional Court, and which could not be changed, for lack of agreement between the political actors. Four months and five days after the elections, the authorities are not constituted and the reform process has not restarted as desired. Of course, we can always find explanations for these delays: the complexity of the country, its painful past and the trauma of war, as well as the unfinished work of reconciliation, are very real problems that must indeed be taken into account. But make no mistake, what is at stake at the moment is not the overcoming of a new crisis, but indeed the European future of the country. And it is not to us that the political leaders of Bosnia and Herzegovina are accountable, but to their own citizens. The people of Bosnia and Herzegovina have the right to a political and institutional system that works and does not discriminate 20. They have the right to live a decent life in their own country, rather than being forced into exile. They have the right to an independent judiciary that does its job without undue political interference. The citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina have the right to live in a society that is not plagued by corruption in every sector of their lives. They also have the right to an effective and depoliticized administration, which is at the service of citizens and not the other way around. Finally, they have the right to free media that inform them objectively and without political pressure.  Membership of the European Union can bring it to them. All this is, in fact, within reach, provided that the political elites abandon their little political games and stop using hatred towards others and division. The time has come for political actors to be responsible, to train the authorities without delay at all levels and to finally show determination in the pursuit of economic and political reforms geared towards the European Union. Coupled with the sending of responses to additional questions from the European Commission, these elements will give Bosnia and Herzegovina a chance to obtain candidate status. Why not this year? Finally, I would like to highlight the very important issue of cooperation with the European Parliament and urge you, Commissioner, to make it a political priority in the next steps in The European journey of Bosnia and Herzegovina.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 216, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "George Ciamba", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, it’s a great pleasure for me to be here today and to discuss with you the Commission’s 2018 report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. Let me express my gratitude for the work by Parliament’s rapporteur on Bosnia and Herzegovina, Cristian Dan Preda. Let me start by reiterating our strong commitment to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s identity as a single, united and sovereign country, with a strong European perspective. Following the elections on 7 October 2018 and recalling the conclusions of June 2018, the Council expects Bosnia and Herzegovina’s leaders to engage constructively in the Government’s formation at all levels, in the interests of all citizens, so that the country moves forward with reforms and progress on the European path. Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU membership application of February 2016 represents a strategic commitment to advance towards the EU, but needs to be translated into comprehensive results on the ground. These results cannot be achieved without functioning institutions. We welcome the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s common message of commitment to the country’s EU path and its determination to cooperate in this respect, a message that was clearly sent during the recent visit to Brussels on 29 and 30 January. We welcome the adoption of some EU—oriented reforms, such as the one on excise duties. However, we share your concerns that much time has been lost on divisive rhetoric and pre-electoral campaigning. This has significantly slowed down the pace of reforms. A number of important high—priority areas remain. We need to do more on the inclusive socio-economic reforms; on the reforms in the field of the rule of law, including the fight against corruption and organised crime; on public administration reform; on the fight against radicalisation and terrorism, and we need to further improve cooperation between all levels of government. We share your concerns over the lack of progress in the area of freedom of expression and the media and we expect Bosnia and Herzegovina to intensify efforts to address the issue.  We regret that no compromise was reached with regard to amending the electoral framework ahead of the October 2018 elections. As pointed out in your resolution, all political leaders now need to assume their responsibilities and find a domestic solution with regard to the Federation House of Peoples. Electoral reform should be approached in a spirit of dialogue in order to move the country towards European standards. Turning to the opinion process, let me welcome the commitment of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina to send very soon the additional answers to the Commission’s questionnaire on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU membership application. We welcome the results already achieved through the coordination mechanism on EU matters and we encourage Bosnia and Herzegovina to make further use of this important tool. We expect the authorities to remain actively committed to the opinion process at all levels and to provide any further input deemed required.  Let me recall that when preparing its opinion, the Commission will pay particular attention to the implementation of the Sejdić-Finci ruling, acknowledging that the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina lists Bosnians, Croats and Serbs as its constituent peoples, along with the others. The Council reiterates that the principles of equality of all citizens and of non-discrimination should be fully warranted.  We will continue to support the country in its efforts to implement reforms and to advance further on its European path. They should keep to the course. The Council will revert to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU integration process on the basis of the Commission’s expected opinion on the country’s application for EU membership.

It is true that 2015 was an upward trend for Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is also true that in 2017 this trend has somehow stopped and I really consider that bad. It is also very bad that four months after the elections, not all levels of government were formed. Everything we do for Bosnia and Herzegovina and what is done is due to the interests of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina and therefore reforms must be implemented. But it also doesn't matter to the European Union, and especially not to Croatia, what our external border looks like and what the situation from our external border looks like. And that's why we care a lot about Bosnia and Herzegovina going the best way. What I want to emphasize here is that we keep sending messages to political leaders in Bosnia and Herzegovina that they have to agree, especially on the electoral law, and today I am obliged to mention it here. So the electoral law has to change and that's something that's the basis of all the beginnings of reforms, etc. Manipulations with elections that are evidently happening must be avoided, and here I refer specifically to the members of the Croatian people and the Croatian people, who do not have equal rights in Bosnia and Herzegovina when it comes to elections. Therefore, we are obliged to note this. I believe that if an agreement were reached on this, everything would take a better path.

We are far from having some concrete results but I think we share the same interests and need to push the country, not only in the European direction, but with the consequence to improve living conditions of people in the country, because this is exactly what counts, what is relevant and what should be our – once again – tireless aim.  In that respect we welcome the text, which is a balanced one and which is largely in line with the Commission’s April 2018 report on Bosnia and Herzegovina. It reflects well the situation in the country, including the challenges and outstanding issues on Bosnia and Herzegovina’s European integration path.  I welcome the support this resolution provides for the EU approach towards Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is particularly essential at a very critical moment in time for the country and its newly elected leaders. A time when the commitments taken before the elections need to be translated into concrete reforms. A time when governments need to be formed across the country and a time when the divisive rhetoric of the campaigning stresses the need for reconciliation, unity and consensus building around the country’s objective, meaning EU integration. This was the main message to Bosnia and Herzegovina’s Presidency members whom President Tusk, President Juncker, High Representative Mogherini and myself had the opportunity to meet two weeks ago in Brussels. This was their first joint trip abroad as newly elected Presidency members, a token of their commitment to advance towards the EU in line with what the citizens of their country demand. And this is in the beginning of a critical year for Bosnia and Herzegovina during which we would like to see irreversible progress towards the European Union. At the same time, we particularly stressed to Presidency members that comprehensive reforms, as done by other countries at similar stages in the process, are required. This is not only about providing answers to our questions stemming from the Opinion Questionnaire – which we expect soon and in a consolidated manner, may I say very clearly – but delivering on rule of law, fundamental rights, electoral reform, public administration, good governance, as well as further harmonisation with EU rules and norms. The capacity of the newly elected leaders to deliver will be the yardstick upon which the EU will assess Bosnia and Herzegovina’s readiness to further advance towards the Union. In this respect the Commission is fully dedicated to advancing Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU perspective. Our upcoming Opinion on the country’s application for Union membership will provide for the first time a comprehensive roadmap of reforms for the country to carry out, for the first time against the entire obligations EU Member States have. We are stepping up our technical assistance in the country with dedicated field support in the key areas of rule of law and fundamental rights, including the monitoring of a number of high—profile cases. The Commission has also now doubled the financial assistance envelope for Bosnia and Herzegovina – EUR 80 million per year in grants for the period 2017-2020 – to support the country implementing a number of countrywide strategies, such as on energy, environment or rural development. And this in addition to the support provided as part of the regional envelope, notably on connectivity agenda projects. To conclude, I would like to stress that the Commission will continue to support Bosnia and Herzegovina as we believe that the future of this country lies in the Union. At the same time, there are outstanding challenges which need to be seriously addressed, requiring substantial efforts from the country’s elected leaders.

The creation of a new pro-Turkish, pro-Erdoğan lobbying organisation 'Union of European Balkan Democrats' in Bosnia underlines the political importance of this question.

So, some small technical advances were made, the program reform was adopted, the coordination mechanism, the application for membership was submitted, the first set of questions was answered. Similarly, some sectoral strategies have been adopted, but the fundamental problem of the country, namely its dysfunction and internal conflicts and divisions, mainly along ethnic lines, this problem of Bosnia and Herzegovina remains and can even be argued, it is a question of attitude and subjective impression, it can be argued even that the situation today is worse in this sense, in terms of internal relations, functionality of the state, than it was five years ago.  It is certainly a good thing that the European Union, all its political bodies, has adopted a clear position on the importance of Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as other countries from this area and the need for these countries to join the European Union. That's a good thing.  The Commission is also doing well, although the reports may be some way more consistent. Often there is a difference between the description and the final score, there is no hierarchy of goals. The Commission could therefore do much better here, but obviously what we have been doing over the past five years is not enough.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has moved towards European integration and, of course, along this path, which is not easy, there are quite a few obstacles to it.

In addition to living here the whole spectrum of different nationalities of the Balkans, a special religious structure of the population has been established over the centuries. In cities, Muslims dominated, in the countryside Orthodox. In a small area in the north-east of the country, the population of the Catholic faith traditionally lives. So-called Serbs, so-called Bosnians and so-called Croats speak all three dialects of the common language, regardless of religion. After a bloody war backed by external forces, two structural units were established in the territory. One of them in the northeast – the Republic of Serbia – and the other is the Muslim-Croatian Federation.  It is completely incomprehensible to me that the European Union has been trying to change this situation from the beginning, regardless of the wishes of the people of the country. After all, the Dayton Peace Agreement sets out certain procedures, and it is not possible to require a change in the state order as part of the negotiating conditions for any country to join the European Union. Bosnia and Herzegovina has a number of problems that are far more important for the lives of local people. First of all, it is about connecting energy networks with neighbouring states, improving rail and road infrastructure, and a clear agreement on the rules of coexistence with important neighbours, in particular Serbia, and, as my colleague mentioned here, croatia.

The conditions that the country must fulfil are clear: to form a government as soon as possible, to deliver answers to additional questions from the Commission and to continue reforms, both in the area of the rule of law and in the social economy. In the last debate in the European Parliament, I would like to draw attention to two more. Firstly, I call on my parliamentary colleagues and the Member States not to forget the enlargement policy and Bosnia and Herzegovina in the year of the European elections, even if this does not yield political points. And secondly, I call on the leaders in Bosnia to use the common objective of rapprochement with the Union to overcome the differences between the various political and ethnic forces in the country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 231, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Željana ZOVKO", "mepid": "185341", "text": "   – Dear Chairman, Distinguished Commissioner Hahn, I welcome the agreement reached on Sunday by the leaders of the Croatian and Serbian constituent communities in Mostar to accelerate the formation of a new Council of Ministers in accordance with your recommendations and those of High Commissioner Mogherini, which you made after the elections.

But when we talk about the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, it seems that despite the efforts we make and the recommendations we make, everything remains a dead letter on paper. Despite a request from the Council and Parliament, the electoral law has not been changed in Bosnia and Herzegovina, resulting in additional discrimination against Croats who, as a constituent people, are not even able to elect their own member of the presidency. This is only the continuity of systematic discrimination against Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which occurs in all segments of their lives.  Bosnia and Herzegovina's place is in the European Union. I want that with all my heart. But Bosnia and Herzegovina must first become a functioning state because the current institutional and legal framework is unsatisfactory and unsustainable, and that is why Dayton needs to experience upgrading and modification.  On the other hand, I have to draw special attention here to the issue of environmental protection. Despite the adoption of my amendments urging Bosnia and Herzegovina to bring the work of the refinery in Bosanski Brod in line with environmental standards, there is still no progress and the citizens of Slavonski Brod suffer the consequences as a result. We expect Bosnia and Herzegovina as a signatory to international environmental conventions to start adhering to their provisions.

Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, I will start with the suggestion made by the Minister, Mr Ciamba, because I think it is really a great initiative to work with young people, to talk to them about Europe and to see how this reconciliation could be achieved. As we have seen today, the debate on Bosnia and Herzegovina has gone in all directions: our British colleague brought Star Trek into the debate, the Greek colleague was talking about NATO at the port of Thessaloniki, and I wanted to ask him, if we are talking about the real strategic issues, why was the port of Piraeus given to the Chinese. But with Bosnia and Herzegovina, we are still talking about one of our countries in the Western Balkans. This country is a European country thanks to the action of our Croatian friends: 95 per cent of the Croats in Bosnia and Herzegovina are European citizens and I have always said that there is no Mep, in particular, and no European nation closer to Bosnia and Herzegovina than the Croats. But perhaps the Croats should also think of others, not just themselves. They will be true supporters of the integration of Bosnia and Herzegovina on the day when they will also talk about others and not just Croats, who are already European citizens. Let me also suggest to our socialist friends and our liberal friends to make a small effort and to integrate political parties from Bosnia and Herzegovina into their network because we, the EPP, are very well represented there, but there is no liberal party or socialist party in Bosnia and Herzegovina. How do you help them if you don't have contacts, if you don't work with your friends on the spot?

As you know, the European Parliament is strongly committed to certain issues of great interest to citizens. We want to be the democratic heart of Europe. We are the only institution elected by the citizens and we have fought hard for an increase in the Eu ropean Union budget from 1.1 to 1.3, focusing on the issue of own resources, and we have chosen to engage clearly on the issue of immigration as well.

On the issue of Brexit, the European Parliament places great emphasis on protecting EUROPEAN citizens living in the UK. On major infrastructure, we have voted for a substantial increase in funding so that the European infrastructure system can promote growth. As far as foreign policy is concerned, we are in for a common foreign and defence policy. We recently chose to ask the Member States to recognise venezuela's interim President, Mr Guaidò, under the Venezuelan Constitution. My final point concerns Parliament – and I know that this is part of your government's programme – we want a European Parliament that counts more, that has the power of legislative initiative like all parliaments in the way and that also has the powers of inquiry, which, under the Treaty, already exists but which it has not yet been able to exercise.

Mr Tajani, Mr Katainen, honourable Members and Members of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, it is indeed an honour for me to be here today, and I say this with sincere feeling, before you in order to outline and foreshadow the future of Europe in accordance with the guidelines of the Italian Government.  With a view to the commitment to the future of our continent, I would like to begin by expressing a moving memory in memory of Antonio Megalizzi, an Italian who described himself as in love with the European Union, who, as you know, fell victim here in Strasbourg two months ago to the barbarity of terrorism.  In a globalised world in which the economy seems to have taken over politics and law, and where the weight of an economic choice taken at many longitudes can have a severe impact on our citizens, we must ask ourselves what role the European Union has, the role it can play, given that the nation states, and therefore the Member States themselves, are not in a position to do so. , alone are unable to respond to complex global challenges.  The common European building is going through – we must all recognise this – a particularly critical phase. The European project seems to have lost its driving force. The complex historical situation before us, the representatives of the institutions, challenges us, within the framework of our respective roles and responsibilities, to address issues of crucial importance.  As in the past, others who have preceded us at the same critical stages, we are called upon to make a joint effort, fuelled by a great sense of responsibility. Our task is to relaunch the European project, making it regain its credibility and cohesion in order to increase its sustainability, effectiveness and plausibility.  The challenges of the present time are new and complex, they require vision and, if I may say so, also some dose of creativity, but above all they presuppose awareness of our mission in the world. The big questions we are all called upon to answer are questions of meaning. What Kind of Europe do we want? What Kind of Europe do we need? How do we perceive ourselves and how do we represent ourselves? These are questions that challenge our consciences and deserve the utmost consideration and authenticity of answers. Because we are in the seat of the European Parliament, directly elected by the citizens of the Union, as the substantial and genuine custodian of European sovereignty.  We are – we should be – first and foremost a people: the people of Europe. Has progressive progress on the path of integration really made us a people, a community of destiny, beyond any legal fictio? Certainly, the process of defining and building a European people has experienced significant moments of progress. The history of modern and contemporary Europe has been marked by deep divisions, lacerations and contrasts, which have defined and forged an articulated populism rich in languages, cultural identities and traditions.  However, these societies have experienced irreversible and fruitful cultural, legal and social contamination. We have increasingly integrated our economic systems, our educational models, our social legislation, giving up areas of sovereignty and transferring increasingly important competences from the States to the Union. We have allowed the citizens of the various Member States to move freely within European territory, conceived as a single legal area. The free movement of persons, even more so than the free movement of goods and capital, has been one of the most significant achievements in the process of European integration, if we only consider the load of nationalist hatred and identity retreat that had swept across the continent between the end of the nineteenth century and the first half of the twentieth century, and which was dramatically deflated in the two world wars. Europeans, especially the youngest, do not wish to give up this fundamental freedom of movement, thanks to which, to such a significant extent and with a naturalness unknown to past generations, they have been able to increase their heritage of human, cultural and professional experiences, accepting national specificities increasingly as variations of the same sensitivity, as different ways of participating in a common feeling. The process of creating a European people has also been strongly fuelled by the legal dimension. The ripe fruit of a centuries-old process of civilization, legal culture has in recent years taken on a decisive role in the creation of a single feeling to the point of encouraging the formation of a European demos.  In this respect, the action taken by the European Court of Justice, each within its own sphere of competence, was fundamental. human rights and the Court of Justice, in close liaison with the national constitutional courts. This is why a European legal area has been created in which citizens can identify and find protection through a refined and complete system of multi-level protection of the fundamental rights of the individual, based on a shared heritage of constitutional traditions. This advanced and articulated system of judicial protection, now, I would say, indelible in the legal heritage of the Union, represents an achievement of civilisation, certainly to be defended and preserved, precisely because of the virtuous effects that it is likely to produce in the collective imagination of the European citizen, feeding the awareness of being part of a shared destiny, of belonging to a people in the sense of a community participating in the same fruitful process of civilization.  In spite of all this, however, we have not yet managed to become truly and fully a people; we did not have the courage to build an inclusive model that realistically, beyond all rhetoric, would encourage the creation of a European demos. Especially since 1989, there has been no – there are isolated exceptions, for heaven's sake – a genuinely political vision of the European Union, a long-term, forward-looking perspective, without which every project will run aground, every dream discolored, overwhelmed by day-to-day administration. The prophetic momentum was lacking, but they met the great statesmen of the post-war period.  To exacerbate this lack of prospective vision, Over the last thirty years, European governance has strongly anchored itself in the pure economic dimension, in a perspective unequivocally oriented towards the implementation of liberal guidelines, aimed at promoting privatisations of essential services and goods, reduction of regulation in vital economic sectors, contraction of social support and welfare policies, which have increased inequalities in wealth and opportunities as a whole.  Especially with the deepening economic crisis, European governance has supported strict policies aimed solely at keeping sovereign debts within precise parameters and at keeping the inflation rate of the common currency as low as possible, even in the face of a very sharp contraction in consumption, with devastating social effects.  European policy, faced with an unprecedented economic crisis, has been portrayed, afraid, on the other side of the cold grammar of procedures, eventually gradually losing contact with its people and making the distance, which is not only geographical, between Brussels and the many peripheries of the continent increasingly unbridgeable. Gradually and inexorably, politics has renounced its legitimizing and representative role, appearing in the eyes of distant and oligarchic citizens, unable to understand the real needs of the community. It has become – as the political scientist Jan Zielonka pointed out, a ceremonial parameter covering very complex global operations, largely incomprehensible if not secret.  The powerful oppositional charge that the people of Europe, in their various forms, are expressing towards the elites speaks to our consciences: it reminds us that politics, enslaved to the reasons of the economy, has failed in its task, has abdicated its mission. This is a decisive turning point in the history of a united Europe. We have fundamental decisions ahead of us for our future. This European people, who have come back powerfully on the stage of history, urgently ask to be heard, and call for a decisive change in method and perspective.  It is a precious opportunity, I believe, to make up for lost time, to reverse the process of progressive detachment between rulers and rulers, which, if further fuelled by silence, indifference or even just the attempt to minimize its scope, can lead to the implosion of the world we had known.  We must not be afraid of conflict: we must show ourselves capable of governing it. We must not react to change by opposing sterile conservatism, all of which is protected by the besieged citadel. On the contrary, we must allow the conflict to emerge, to demonstrate, in the forms of democracy, its driving force, to unleash its innovative role, even assuming the risk of abandoning certain security, of reconsidering the balance of power, models of development and growth that have proved inadequate in the face of the new challenges, no longer capable of withstanding the impact of impoverished societies, crossed by precariousness and loneliness. , from disappointment and resentment, feelings that, if still persistently denied, can fuel rebelliousness and protest from unpredictable outcomes, as shown by various phenomena taking place in some European countries.  The Europeanism of the twenty-first century, in my opinion, inevitably presupposes a radical rethink of the forms and institutions that have characterised the history of integration over the last thirty years. They urgently call for genuine conversion, which is also, in some respects, a return to the origins, to the founding reasons for the European dream. Will the Europe we imagine be able to express a driving force, not simply a stabilising force, in the interests of its citizens, the Member States and common interests?  Geopolitics is rapidly and continuously changing. The new strategic balances are characterized by extreme fluidity, also considering that some important powers, while failing to establish real poles of international attraction, see their capacity for influence constantly grow. In this context, no Member State alone can play a significant role. Hence the hope that a united European voice will also find its place in the UN Security Council. This is a battle on which the European Union must move in a coordinated manner and must speak with one voice.  The European Union must be able to speak to the world. A strong, ambitious and cohesive European Union is first and foremost necessary in order to improve its capacity for interlocution with the United States. As I said from my first speech to the Italian Parliament, we strongly believe in the transatlantic relationship with Washington: we must continue to work to preserve the strategic value of our relations, in which the things that unite us, first and for all values and principles, prevail over every possible difference and misunderstanding.  At the same time, a strong Europe is needed to accredit us in dialogue with key global stakeholders. Russia and China are part of any solution to major international crises, starting with those closest to Europe's borders and interests. I cannot see any benefit to the European Union in abandoning dialogue with Russia and China, or in deluding itself that it can promote isolationist policies towards them.  Rather, we will have to promote their all-round engagement.  But how do we achieve this strong Europe, which we all agree on? We must certainly continue along the path of integrating European defence, exploiting all the potential contained in the implementation of permanent and structured cooperation (the CFSP) and the European Defence Fund. A common European defence is not only not antithetical to NATO membership, but can be a useful complement to it, thus giving concrete proof that the European Union remains effective and capable of making progress, not least in order to give more security to its citizens. Not forgetting that a European Union that aspires to be a global player cannot ignore maintaining close defence and security ties with the UK, even after Brexit.  But the essential prerequisite for ensuring a strong Europe in the world is to ensure its solidarity and cohesion first and foremost, through the collective responsibility of the Member States. Migration and economic and financial governance are two emblematic challenges of the urgent need to restore confidence and solidarity in Europe. A substantial change of perspective is essential, and these principles must not become prey to divisive dynamics between Member States on the major issues that should form an integral part of the daily European debate.  Disagreements, including bilateral disagreements – and we have clear confirmation of this these days – are more the effect than the cause of Europe's inability to propose solutions. It is this inability, not disagreements, that weakens the driving force of the European project.  Europe started looking late at migration. It is thanks to Italy that the migration issue has reached the centre of the European Union's agenda. Europe cannot continue to deal with migratory flows from an emergency perspective, but must rely on a structural approach in order to arrive at stable and effective solutions. I also make an appeal in this very authoritative Chamber which I have renewed, you see, at every European Council, at every informal summit in which I have taken part: we cannot postpone beyond the full implementation of the conclusions of the European Council of 28 June last year: without a multi-level European management strategy for migratory flows, the very resilience of a united Europe cannot be compromised. A European strategy must tackle primary movements with the right priority, with a multi-level approach. Otherwise, secondary entries will never really be under control.  Those arriving in a landing country arrive in Europe. Aldo Moro argued that no one is called to choose between being in Europe and be in the Mediterranean, because the whole of Europe is in the Mediterranean. This principle must always be remembered, not only in order to deal with the issue of migration in the right perspective, but also at a time when European security itself is at stake, from support for the political process in Libya, to European support for Africa and the stabilisation of the Middle East chessboard.  Italy, you see, is a convinced driving force for the centrality of the Mediterranean for the future of Europe. This is borne out by my visits to Algeria and Tunisia last November, the Palermo conference of 12 November last, my visits to Lebanon and Iraq last week. Soon I will visit Morocco. This action is part of Italy's overall strategy, which aims to make a substantial and dynamic contribution to the stabilisation of the main theatres of crisis, in line with the commitment of the UN and the European Union, in the interest not only of our country, but of the whole of Europe.  Europe, looking beyond the Mediterranean, must invest politically and financially in cooperation with Africa and Africa, otherwise illegal migration can be temporarily reduced, but never eradicated, nor can returns, which require coordinated action by Europe and the Member States, be improved, including through the incentive of development cooperation and with mutual European recognition of decisions in this area.  The Commitment of the Italian Government in Africa is part of this approach, which I myself am pursuing with the utmost conviction. That is why I also went to the Horn of Africa, a region that we hope will live its spring, and to Niger and Chad in mid-January. If Europe wants to be a point of reference also in terms of values, it must promote a new approach to Africa's problems: it must pursue a new model of cooperation inspired by partnership between equals, in a spirit that wants to increase opportunities and at the same time responsibilities on both sides.  We cannot remain indifferent to the fact that the majority of the African population, men, women and children, live in inhumane conditions of poverty despite the considerable natural resources available to their territories, nor can we remain indifferent to the fact that much of the wealth generated by the African economy is dispersed among a few thousand offshore companies located in artificial havens or otherwise benefits foreign investors.  I am pleased that the priority of cooperation with Africa has been recognised by the European Commission itself. I would like to thank Jean-Claude Juncker for his strong impetus towards this objective, which is so important for our common future. The recognition of this priority must be accompanied by the allocation of adequate financial resources and the development of new methods of intervention. Europe must commit itself to drawing up a catalogue of best practices in order to arrive at a truly equal and sustainable model of cooperation.  Governing migration, a structural phenomenon that will last in the Europe of tomorrow, also requires reflection in the perspective of the next multiannual financial framework 2021-2027. Europe must, of course, equip itself with stable and lasting financial instruments and mechanisms to govern the migratory flows of countries of origin and transit. There is also an urgent need for the three Mediterranean routes to receive political and economic attention of equal intensity and consistency. The European Union has allocated EUR 6 billion to the agreement with Turkey. The Eu ropean Union for Africa trust fund is still seeking funding and has a gap of at least EUR 500 million in relation to its commitments.  No less complex is the European management of the internal dimension of migration. It must be dispeled from the illusion that protection of Europe's external maritime border can be resolved, with a huge expense for thousands of agents of the so-called strengthened Frontex and with an additional burden on the countries of first arrival that would also have an impact in terms of security.  Migratory flows do not govern themselves, we need shared efforts. As agreed at the June European Council, they must cover all 28 Member States. The proposal to reform the Dublin Regulation, approved by the European Parliament in November 2017, is not sustainable in the current European Union: unfortunately, the unwillingness of the majority of Member States to participate in automatic and compulsory solidarity prevails. However, the implementation of the conclusions of the European Council of 28 June, which are based on the principles of solidarity and fair sharing of responsibilities, which are, moreover, referred to in Article 80 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, cannot be postponed any longer. Faced with the loss of human lives abused, sold and broken, we must all fight together against the traffickers and tormentors, who represent an affront to humanity, as well as a threat to our security. Let us stop remaining divided, giving in to nationalist or regionalist logic, and let us try to put into practice genuine solidarity, so as to restore a Europe that is respectful of human lives and its own security.  The need for true solidarity and sharing between Member States, without divisions between the areas and regions of the Union, also applies to the no less priority challenge of completing economic and monetary union, especially at a time when global trade tensions are putting the European economic situation at risk, as confirmed by the European Commission's recent estimates of Member States' GDP.  I hope that more attention will be given to the demand by Italy and other Southern European Member States for an urgent rebalancing of risk reduction and sharing, in favour of effective convergence that does not leave growth behind in the name of rigorism. The reform effort – and I am, of course, referring in particular to the commitment initiated by the Italian Government with the 2019 budget law – is socially sustainable, even before the economic one, if structural reforms do not, however, become a sisyphus effort, which stifles growth and mortifies social cohesion.  With the budget law, Italy has embarked on a path of growth in stability. While keeping the accounts in order, we have worked to ensure a better present and future for citizens left behind and whose urgent expectation of change the Italian Government has intended to represent. At the same time, the boost to public investment, including through reforms aimed at simplifying the entire regulatory-legal framework, testifies to the intention to give dynamism to an economy that plays a central role for our continent.  The economic governance of the European Union must take account of the need to balance growth and stability.  But what does it mean to overcome austerity? It certainly does not mean disoresing the value of financial stability: it means, on the whole, committing ourselves to pursuing the value of social stability and sustainable development as well. I am pleased that Jean-Claude Juncker has recently made a reference to the fact that in the case of the Greek crisis austerity was perhaps reckless. Many of us have been convinced of this ever since. What must be avoided is that someone in a few years' time apologises for a lack of European management of migration or a lack of social Europe.  Europe must look to the future of those who are already at risk of having no opportunities in the Europe of tomorrow. It is essential that the European Union invests more courageously in young people, education and innovation. It must also not discourage public investment geared towards these objectives, considering it as a factor of deficit and instability, rather than as a driving force for the future of our continent.  On the other hand, work and balanced and sustainable economic and social progress are objectives which, in the wake of the Maastricht Treaty, the Treaty of Lisbon has confirmed, but which, ten years after its entry into force, still seem far from being implemented. Criticism of the incompleteness of the European institutional architecture, now also coming from the authorities of the Member States, has been partly accepted by the European Commission and the ECB. They took appropriate initiatives, including the Eurogroup decision of 21 January which, in implementation of the Eurosummit of 14 December, set up a high-level group to examine the implementation of EDIS, the European deposit insurance scheme and the completion of the European banking union.  As far as banking crises are concerned, progress has been made, although the instrumentation requires a fine-tussle which the high-level group is hopefully taking on. The change in the rules for resolving banking crises has led to a step backwards in the endowment of instruments that must be filled before a possible new recession takes back the clock of Italian and European financial and banking stability.  Under the Maastricht Treaty, the task of ensuring the credibility of sovereign credits was entrusted, if you remember, to the convergence commitments towards 60 % of the debt ratio of individual countries, to policies of budgetary rigour and to the implementation of reforms at national level. National. Despite the Commission's watchful eye, the situation has revealed, as the Italian case shows, significant critical issues following the outbreak of the financial crisis in the USA in 2008 and the consequent great global recession.  In order to be able to tackle these problems with a more effective approach, we also need to move decisively towards the creation of common financing instruments at European level, which will enable us to face together the challenges we face, combining responsibility and solidarity in a balanced way. Inadequate and insufficient solidarity within the European Union also explains why Europe struggles late to be fairer, more social.  The new European legislature must pursue the fight against unemployment and support for growth more decisively and as a matter of urgency. A European boost to these priorities, even with bold formulae such as European unemployment insurance, is the best antidote to nationalistic drifts, as well as to lack of work. The gap in unemployment, especially among young people, between some disadvantaged areas of Europe and others with excellent employment rates is widening to the point of promoting nationalistic closures, if it is to be tackled only through national policies. The advantaged areas will try to secure against European policies perceived as a cost, while disadvantaged areas on a national basis will not be able, if at all, to find resources to make real progress.  A fairer and more supportive Europe must also be an objective for the next multiannual financial framework. The complexity inherent in this type of negotiation must not see this priority lost, especially in the face of the existential challenges facing the European Union. An appropriate balance is therefore crucial between the new priorities such as immigration, growth, investment, security and traditional policies, cohesion and the common agricultural policy, which must continue to receive full support, as central to the socio-economic cohesion of the continent.  There are many other challenges to which we are called. We must commit ourselves to promoting fairer world trade, which is better able to protect consumers. We must put in place every useful initiative to contribute with ambitious determination to the international commitment to climate change. More generally, we must continue to play a leading role in protecting old and new rights, all the more deserving of protection in the digital age, even in spite of the fact that rights cost money. I am thinking in particular of the decisive role that Europe can play as a security provider, with specific reference to new hybrid and, in particular, cyber threats. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the question of meaning with which I began my speech is predominant. What Kind of Europe do we want? What Kind of Europe do we need to guarantee the citizens of Europe a future equal to the sixty years of peace and prosperity that the Union has secured? My answer is once again the same: Europe must be close to its peoples. The European Union, in the twenty-first century, must pursue its project by the people and for the people, starting – and I am pleased to say so here today – with a European Parliament with strengthened role and powers, with particular regard to the power of legislative initiative and inquiry, as the only institution that enjoys direct democratic legitimacy.  It would also be important for Parliament to have a power of general accountability in relation to the other European institutions. The European Parliament will be able to play a decisive role in the face of europe's demand for change, after a decade marked by historic events that have changed the geopolitical order of the continent. At the same time, an adequate strengthening of institutions of direct democracy is, also and above all in a European context, an essential development for the restoration of the credibility of the institutions vis-à-vis the citizens.  The European scenario is explicit in indicating widespread distrust and disillusionment of citizens. The Government that I have the honour of presiding over stems from the desire to meet as a priority the urgent demand for change of Italian citizens, with answers that politics has not been able to offer for too long. Even at European level, as I said at the beginning, this demand for change must be understood and properly represented.  If further confirmation of the urgency of putting these principles into practice were needed, just think of Brexit, a central issue for the European Union for the coming years. In the face of this challenge, the European Union has shown that it is able to react in a united and supportive spirit and that it is able to protect the results of over sixty years of European integration, without giving in to punitive attitudes towards a member of the European family who no longer wishes to be a part of it. It is an epochal process, if we think about it, unprecedented, that must be managed in an orderly manner, always having in the first place the objective of guaranteeing citizens' rights and protecting the social and economic fabric from the negative consequences of Brexit.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, with courage and rigour we must strive to review what has not worked, including in the implementation of the Treaties, and to combat centrifugal tendencies and European disintegration, daughters, sometimes, as is also the case in my country, of European disillusionment.  If we want Europe to remain our common future, it is time to follow words with deeds, together embarking on a path to a new Europe, a Europe of the people that is more supportive, more inclusive, fairer, ultimately more democratic, the only one in which citizens of today and tomorrow deserve to live.

It has given Europe so much and has been there from the very start, shaping our Union every step of the way. It was Spinelli and Rossi in prison on the island of Ventotene who set out their dream of a free and united Europe. They called on the nations of Europe, so long adversaries, to come together to ensure that the mistakes of the past would never happen again. After the war, De Gasperi became one of the great pioneers of the European Union and in 1957 it was on Capitoline Hill that the Treaty of Rome was signed and our Union was born, with six founding Member States. 60 years on, in 2017, it was once again on those same steps in Rome that the leaders of our Member States stood, side by side, to renew their vows for our Union. This time there were 27 of them from right across our continent. A sign of how far we have come. I say this because Italy’s special history is one of the many reasons that it has such a unique and important place in our Union. But I also say this because it shows that Europe moves forward, that Europe is at its best when it has Italy and Italian people at its beating heart. This history must serve as a guide and as a reminder for our future. To build a successful future for our Union, Europe needs a strong Italy at its heart, just as strong as vibrant Italy needs a strong Europe. We must build our common future together, in unity and in solidarity, always working with and not against each other; talking with each other and not about each other. When it comes to building a true Union of solidarity, Italy is the best place to start. It is where the European Solidarity Corps started its work.  To help Italy rebuild following the tragic earthquakes it suffered in 2016, 230 young European volunteered in Umbria and across the regions hardest hit, in addition to the EUR 1.2 billion of financial support provided to Italy under the EU Solidarity Fund. We all have seen the images of young volunteers from all over Europe helping to rebuild the ancient and beautiful church of Norcia. This is the solidarity that builds our European Union today and that must continue to build our common future. Italy itself has shown the same spirit countless times over the years. President Juncker said many times ‘Italy is one of those who saved Europe’s honour in the Mediterranean at the height of the migration crisis’. And the truth is that some others were too slow to support the efforts of the Italian people.  But it is also true that Europe stood up and supported Italy in every way it could. From the beginning of the migration crisis to the end of 2018, the Commission made almost EUR 950 million available to support migration and border management in Italy. This includes EUR 225 million in emergency support to fund border surveillance and search and rescue operations, to improve reception facilities and to support all of the authorities and people on the ground. Europe has been there for Italy. We should not forget Operation Sofia or the role of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency. Saving lives at sea is a joint effort and here again, we need Italy. Prime Minister, it is also clear that Europe still needs to overcome its differences and find sustainable and responsible solutions. We can no longer rely on ad hoc solutions. We have come a long way since the peak of the crisis, with arrivals down by over 97% in the eastern Mediterranean and 80% in the central Mediterranean. 700 000 lives have been saved at sea but clearly we now need to finish the job and conclude the necessary reform of our asylum system. The Commission has put everything on the table and it is now time to move ahead. We need the full engagement of Italy if we want to succeed. Honourable Members, Prime Minister, Europe stands for peace and prosperity and we are all responsible for defending its values together. That means deciding what we want Europe to achieve and it means deciding where to invest and to have the biggest impact on the daily lives of Italians and all Europeans. This is why, last May, the Commission put forward a fair, modern and balanced budget for our future. A budget that is more efficient and more focused on issues that matter the most to our people. For instance, the Commission has proposed an almost threefold increase in funding for migration and security, to reach nearly EUR 33 billion. An increased, simpler more effective and more flexible EU budget for external action will help build partnership with the countries in our neighbourhood and beyond. This will be especially important for Italy as a country, as it has taken so much responsibility in this area. We will invest in making our economies more competitive, more innovative and productive. Key for Italy will be the 50% increase in funding for research and innovation and the EUR 9 billion Digital Europe Programme that will support Italy’s digital transformation. Investing in our future also involves investing in human capital through education and training. This is why the Commission has proposed a doubling of the budget of EUR 30 billion for the Erasmus+ programme, the EU’s flagship for learning mobility. We aim to increase support to all sectors, including higher education as well as vocational education and training. In 2017, more than 65 000 Italians participated in Erasmus programmes. In the next multiannual budget we will build on the success of investment plans for Europe – the so-called Juncker Plan. Italy is one of the largest beneficiaries of the Plan, with close to EUR 58 billion of investment triggered in Italy’s economy and over 215 000 small and medium-sized businesses supported. The Juncker Plan has significantly increased private investment but also public investment in Italy. It is a positive sign because we should not put too much burden on taxpayers if private liquidity is available. That investment is making a real difference on the ground, right across Italy. EUR 70 million is helping to refurbish the local hospital in Treviso; EUR 200 million is going into upgrading Puglia’s water network to improve quality and access to clean drinking water for more than four million people; and EUR 500 million is supporting the rolling out of high speed internet so that seven million more households in Italy benefit from quality broadband access. The new programme for the next budget in the EU has the potential to go much further by triggering altogether EUR 650 billion for investment. All of this can, and will, make a real difference on the ground in Italy and across our Union. This is especially true at a time when economic growth is becoming harder across some of our major European economies, partly down to global uncertainties but also because of domestic challenges and choices. Economic growth needs confidence amongst households and investors. Trust is like oxygen, you notice it only when it’s running out. Uncertainty is a poison that seriously hampers jobs and growth. Italy’s growth has been weaker than the eurozone average for many years. This is a structural problem. The weaker growth means fewer jobs for the Italian people. At the same time – and I say this at every occasion – Italy is among the most creative economies in the world. The future of your country is in your hands. Do what is necessary to unleash this creativity and offer a brighter future for the Italian people. Honourable Members, dear Prime Minister, it is now two years since we presented the White Paper on the future of Europe, which kick-started the debate we are having now on what we want our Union to achieve in the years ahead. Five scenarios show different possible paths that we could decide today. But, whatever we choose, there are some things that are constant and one of those is Italy’s central role in building our Union. Europe needs a strong Italy and Italy needs a strong Europe. It was no surprise or coincidence that the first lines of the White Paper were about Spinelli and Rossi’s manifesto. As we look at our future, we should all inspire ourselves from those that have gone before us to build a stronger and more united Union for generations that follow, just as they did for us.

Your speech, Prime Minister, started with the perspective of people. I am from Lower Bavaria and when I go to the service in my Catholic church, I meet the farmers and the nurses there. All of us have our neighbours and our neighbourhood and we talk with them every day. When I speak with them, I see the same problems. We have the perspective of young people all over Europe and the question of social fairness in the European Union.  To answer this, I think we have to be a little bit more specific than what we heard from you today because, to give an answer on the economic problems, the fact is that Italy is today the country with the lowest growth rate in the European Union, as Jyrki Katainen mentioned. This is not only a problem for Italy; it is a problem for the whole European Union because we are speaking about the G7 countries, so one of Europe’s economic engines.  What to do? We in the PPE Group believe that we need investments in today’s European Union and in Italy we see a government that cannot even agree on building up a project that has already been approved between France and Italy. In the PPE we believe in a stable currency, which is fundamental for a strong economy to build up trust. Your government discussed for a few weeks at the start of your government whether you should still be a member of the euro area or not.  We believe that only with the will for reform can you win the economic future of your country. The Programme Countries in Europe – Ireland, Poland, Cyprus, Greece and also Spain – showed that if you have the will for reform, you can win the future and you can create jobs for the younger generation. They did the job on the labour market, the judicial system and the tax system. Even in Germany, I must tell you – my country – it was Gerhard Schröder’s reforms, the Agenda 2010, which created the starting point for the economic strength of today’s Germany. So the will for reform is necessary for winning the future and at the moment your government is not really forward—looking and a front—runner on the question of reforms.  Finally, we believe that a stable budget is crucial for a strong economy and we don’t see that either in Italy. We see a growing debt rate. That is what we see. That is a summary. Additionally, regarding the investments from the European Union in Italy, it is a real problem to see that we have such a lack of growth in Italy and, again, it’s your responsibility. It’s not the responsibility of others, it’s the responsibility of the Italian Government. We fully respect that you are elected and the government has been elected. You have a democratic mandate from the Italian citizens, but it’s probably easier to win elections as an anti-elite movement than to stay in government afterwards as an anti—elite movement. Some of you have probably become, in the meantime, the new elites in Italy. I want to underline a second point which is important, namely the migration thing. I want to show you our full solidarity as the PPE Group, that we think that Italy deserves solidarity. We fully understand the anger of the people in Italy that for years and years they had no solidarity and Italy was alone. That’s why we stick to the principle of a binding solidarity mechanism for the European Union, but it is also a problem for us to see that a member of the European Council is here and tells us that his own body, his own institution, is not delivering on this issue. We delivered on this issue. It’s up to the Council to deliver now.  Finally, on external affairs, let me thank you for sticking to our European approach in the answer on Russia. At the moment you were ready, as the Italian Government, to give consent to the sanctions. That was a good thing. We have a common understanding that Russia’s interest is to weaken the European Union.  On the other hand, in recent days we saw the discussions about Venezuela. For us, as the PPE, it’s clear that we have there a socialist dictator, Maduro, an unfair, undemocratic election, and support from the military and the army. They are even stopping the transport of medicine which is so urgently needed in the country. On the other hand, we have a freely elected parliament looking for a fresh start for the country and simply asking for the right to seek early presidential elections for the country.  That’s why Guaidó was right when he asked today, in a letter he wrote to the Italian citizens, why their government was not supporting him. Why is the Italian Government not supporting the democratic forces in Venezuela? I think you should answer this question if you believe in the common European approach. (Applause) Those are some reflections. I thank you for the general will to look for a clear commitment to the European way of life. Two principles to end with: you said today in an agency at European level that Italy is becoming louder and is more present in the public debate. You say that nobody has a problem with a loud voice from a national point of view. Our problem is, in the European decision-making process, whether loudness is the same principle as egoism. What we need in Europe is compromise, the will for compromise. If everybody were loud, then finally there would only be noise and nothing else.  Finally, you spoke about the breach between people and the European Union decision—making process. You’re here in the European Parliament: Lega Nord is here, the Five Star Movement is here, Forza Italia is here, and Partito Democratico is here. All the forces from all over Europe are here. This is the political landscape of Europe. We all represent our citizens. We are all close to our citizens. There are no elites sitting here. We are representatives of our citizens and this is why this is the place for deciding the future of the European Union.

This is the House of European democracy. This is the House of public debate and of frank language, so please allow me to start with that and to share my worries. I am deeply worried when the Government of a founding member of our European community, the Government of the seventh world industrial power, is driving the Italian nation further into economic and political isolation today – and this against the backdrop of a situation externally where we cannot rely on Washington anymore, as we could in the past, and we have new threats from Russia. We can see your economy shifting towards a recession and we see that industrial production is falling. In this situation, I am deeply saddened by the senseless escalation between France and Italy. What is this? Of what use is this? (Applause) In conflicts such as this – and you know it – there are no gains. Nobody can win. This is a perfect lose—lose for your country and for Europe. People in both countries could end up paying a very high price. Italy and France are one another’s second trade partners – EUR 76 billion is the volume of the annual trade between them. Hundreds of thousands of jobs depend on that. Hundreds of thousands of jobs, not of the elite but of ordinary folk on the ground. The Italian people simply cannot afford to lose any more jobs. This year, Italy will grow by only 0.8%. That is the lowest growth rate in Europe. You may dress the situation up by saying that the goal is to bring back the dignity of labour. I very much wish you had brought back the dignity of labour: 75 000 men and women have lost their work, and many more have become trapped in unstable and low—paid jobs, while countless young people are being forced to leave the country in search of a better life. And as if this wasn’t enough, the livelihoods and life savings of Italian families were recklessly put on the line by a calculated head—on collision course with the Commission over the budget. Why was that so necessary? Was it just one man’s public relations stunt? It has cost the Italian people EUR 1.7 billion during the past couple of months alone. And for what? So that Mr Salvini can blame Brussels. Mr Salvini has a scapegoat for everything, but no solution for anything. This is part of the Italian reality today. (Applause) To distract from the economic mess, Salvini is now even abusing migration. Ich selber war vor zwei Wochen in Catania und habe dort sehen können, wie 47 Menschen 12 Tage lang ein Rettungsschiff nicht haben verlassen dürfen, die Sea-Watch, unter ihnen Minderjährige und Folteropfer, weil sie die Gefangenen einer Ideologie waren, weil sie vorgeführt werden mussten, weil es nicht anders ging als sie zum Spielball einer zynischen Politik zu machen. Das ist nicht das Italien, das wir kennen, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren. Wir kennen ein anderes Italien. Wir kennen das große europäische Italien mit Altiero Spinelli, De Gasperi, die niemals – niemals! – für kurzfristige vermeintliche politische Gewinne ihr Land oder gar Europa zur Disposition gestellt hätten. Ich verstehe sehr gut, und meine Fraktion versteht sehr gut, warum Menschen in Italien enttäuscht sind. Ihre Vorgängerregierung hat Großes geleistet, tausende und abertausende von Menschen aus Seenot gerettet, und Europa hat nicht hinreichend reagiert. Europa hat keine hinreichende Solidarität bewiesen. Aber wer hat sie denn enttäuscht? Doch nicht die proeuropäischen Regierungen, doch nicht diejenigen, die Europa weiter voranbringen wollten? Schauen Sie doch hin! Sagen Sie doch den Menschen in Italien, wer ihnen nicht hilft, endlich die Dublin-Reform zu machen! Das sind doch die Freunde von Herrn Salvini, das sind doch die Kaczynskis, das sind doch die Orbáns und die Menschen wie Herr Kurz in Österreich, die alles blockieren. Das ist doch die Realität! Lassen Sie uns doch die Wahrheit aussprechen! Und es sind die Proeuropäer, die, auch wieder bei Sea-Watch, die Menschen natürlich – natürlich! – gerettet haben, denn genau das gehört sich auch so. Es gibt dieses Europa noch, es gibt dieses Italien noch, wo beide füreinander kämpfen; dieses großartige Italien, diese großartige Nation, das Italien von Spinelli und De Gasperi. Das sehe ich, wenn ich die Fischer in Italien sehe, die Fischer von Lampedusa, die trotz der Bossi-Fini-Gesetze und obwohl sie genau wussten, was auf sie wartet, weiterhin die Menschen aus der See gezogen haben. Das sehe ich bei den Seeleuten der Diciotti – einem Schiff der Küstenwache Ihrer eigenen Nation –, die nicht anlanden durften, und die sagen: Wir haben einen Seefahrerkodex, das ist unsere Ethik, und die steht nicht zur Disposition. Und das sehe ich bei den mutigen Bürgermeistern, die Essen und Wohnungen zur Verfügung stellen, auch wenn die Regierung die Schlafplätze vernichtet hat. Es gibt dieses Italien, das Italien der Menschenwürde, das große Italien der europäischen Werte. Und diesem Italien reichen wir die Hand, weil wir es brauchen. Aber dann sollte Ihre Regierung aufhören, uns die grinsende Fratze der Unmenschlichkeit vorzuführen, denn das hat mit dem Italien, mit dem wahren Italien nichts zu tun.

I think it is a very useful and important opportunity to be able to address issues relating to the future of Europe and the role that a country which, as has been mentioned, is from you but also from all those who have spoken, is central to the construction of this Europe and its prospects. I also think it is important to make an effort, in the sense that these debates often risk being very general, if not general, debates, and that they have very profound diagnoses, which are sometimes at odds with the reality we are experiencing. So my speech will be a speech aimed not only at sharing some of the very critical criticisms and assessments that have been made about what Europe has represented in recent years and about the enormous mistakes that this Europe has made on economic issues and on issues such as immigration – and I disagree with many of the things I have heard in recent speeches on these issues – , but I think it is equally important to try to point out some elements of clarity. I shall try to point out to you, and I will give you some very concrete examples, some strong contradictions, Mr President, which I think must be answered, because at a time when we are talking about immigration – which is one of the issues on which your government, especially at the beginning of this national legislature, has taken action which I consider not to be negative as it is told, but rather useful in putting a problem to the fore – Italian fishermen are not at sea trying to to save immigrants, but they are protesting about what European standards are in relation to some of the issues that concern them. I would like to close this parenthesis and say a few things very quickly.  The first is on immigration. We agree, Mr President. But on the Global Compact there is a photograph of what is a total uncertainty concerning his government. You attended the United Nations Assembly, you said you agreed, then you did not go to Marrakesh afterwards and then you abstained. On Venezuela today he has claimed an important role for Europe, saying that there is a need to speak a single language. Well, we must remember that at the meeting of European Foreign Ministers, thanks to Italy's dissent, the only dissent, Europe was unable to speak a clear word in this direction.  As in economic matters, what you have said is true in terms of analysis, but I am sorry, the consequences to which you refer are absolutely wrong. There are no choices of structural reforms in its development policies at national level, quite the opposite. I am not one of those who are alarmed because there is a risk of increasing the deficit a little at a time of economic difficulty. The issue is how we increase it, what we increase it for. We are increasing it for policies that increase public spending structurally, other than structural reforms.  Furthermore, today is a resounding day because – as has been mentioned before – while we are here, while you are talking to us about the development and growth of our country and italy's role in Europe, your Minister for Infrastructure is presenting a fantomatic report to explain to us that the Tav is a mistake and that it must be blocked. These are the facts before us. So I would like you, Mr President, to give clear answers on this point, so that your conclusion can become a reality, that is to say, from analysis, from words to deeds. Unfortunately, the facts are not going in the right direction for Italy or for Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 256, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I shall try to make my speech in Italian, Mr President. (Scattered laughter and exclamations) Because, apart from my country, and again, I am, Mr Conte, in love with Italy and the Italians. For me, in fact, Italy is more than one country: for me, Italy is an entire civilization. Italy is where our European civilization was born and for centuries artists, writers and intellectuals from all over Europe have visited Italy at least once in their lives. Discovering Italy meant visiting Italy, visiting Florence, visiting Rome, visiting Naples and then dying...  (Laughter, the speaker laughs too) Montaigne did it, Goethe did it, and that is why, Mr Conte, it hurts me today to see the political degeneration of Italy. It is true that a degeneration that began not yesterday, not a year ago: at least, I think, twenty years ago. The impression is that this beautiful country has gone from a staunch defender of Europe, a founder of our European family, to a taillight of the Union. That is the impression we have today in this House and also outside it. And let us tell the whole truth: it all began not with Prime Minister Conte, it all started with misrule under Berlusconi. That is also the truth.  (Scattered applause) Misrule has also worsened under your government, that's the problem... (Protests and exclamations) ... under Salvini, under Di Maio, the real leaders of this Government, a government with a behavior, Mr Conte, sometimes anti-European and also an openly odious government against other Member States, which are part of our European family. It is the Italian Government that has prevented the European Union from being united against Maduro and from recognizing Guaidó as the interim President of Venezuela. And you know that because you are under pressure from the Kremlin and Putin. That is the truth.  (Applause) That is why – and someone has mentioned this – we must say enough about the unanimity rule in the Council as quickly as possible. It is the Italian Government, Mr Conte, which is not part of the majority in the Council to reform our asylum and migration policy. Mr Salvini has specialised in blocking ports for migrants but is also blocking the creation of a genuine European border, a real European coastguard and the implementation of a European reform in Dublin at this time. This, for me, is absurd behaviour, because Italy and the Italian citizens are the first to pay for the lack of this European policy.  And in the last year, and this is my third example, your government has also been responsible for stagnation and a tomorrow, I fear, of the recession from the Italian economy, because your government does not have a strategy for growth, does it not? Your government only has one tactic to get you re-elected with gifts and debts. That is the truth.  And the last – and I want to end with this – the last lightness of his government, of Di Maio, who is using and abusing his office to support the gilets jaunes, a popular movement, it is true, that is now dominated by a group of wreckers, wreckers who set fire to cars, break into shops, destroy bus stops. And Di Maio even met Christophe Chalencon. I know Christophe Chalencon, Mr President: it is he who has called, not once but twice, for a military coup against the elected President of the Republic French. (Scattered applause) Well, congratulations! This is irresponsible behaviour and not the behaviour of a Vice-President of the Council of Ministers of an important European country, such as Italy. She recalls that just a year ago, I think, on November 23, 2017, Di Maio wrote an open letter to Emmanuel Macron, expressing his admiration and suggesting that the 5 Star Movement was in fact the Italian movement of En marche. Ridiculous this behavior! So my question for you, Mr Conte, is how much longer will the puppet moved by Salvini and Di Maio be to continue this thing? (Applause and exclamations) I invite you to be inspired by illustrious Italian compatriots: Spinelli, Ciampi, Giorgio Napolitano, Mario Draghi... (Protests and applause) Yes, yes, Giorgio Napolitano, yes! A great European with a great idea and a Member of this House. And let's not forget my good friend Emma Bonino. These are the men and women who make Italy great and its great role in Europe. This is the difference between Mr. Conte and all these great characters he forgot.

Those who speak to you on behalf of this group are committed to building an alternative to both these options in the construction of a third area and an alternative for Europe based on the self-determination of women, men and peoples. And it is precisely on the front line of the possibility of countering the constraints of neoliberalism, constraints against which this parliamentary group is fighting every day in the name of an idea of equality, that the betrayal of the electoral promises of this government, which is completely prone to neoliberal policies, is measured. It has first bowed to the constraints on deficit-to-GDP overruns, it has not made any commitments regarding budgetary balance in the Constitution. With regard to fair trade, which you mentioned earlier, Prime Minister, there is no position of the Italian Government on either CETA or the ISDS clauses. You spoke of cohesion policy, yet the Italian Government is preparing to approve a differentiated autonomy that is the secession of the rich, it is the opposite of the cohesion policies that would be necessary to respond to the southern question as a European issue. This government has given the green light to the Transatlantic Pipeline, which we opposed as a parliamentary group. Finally, it launched a proposal to work, a proposal for income of subjectance, free work and \"anti-sofa\" rules that offend the dignity of millions of Italian precariouss. Twenty-one Italians have the income of 12 million people, according to Oxfam data, yet you do not make a patrimonial. You make the flat tax, that is, you reduce the progressiveness of taxation and you don't make any plans on the wage issue. No real contrast to neoliberalism.  But it is not only in this area that we are concerned about the future of Europe. This Parliament adopted, on 25 October 2018, also following an attack in my city, Bari, by some Casa Pound militants, a resolution calling on the Member States to actuallye neo-fascist and neo-Nazi groups and any other foundation or association that glorifies and glorifies Nazism and Fascism. I would like to ask you how the Italian Government intends to contribute to its implementation and how it judges, Mr President, the relations between the Italian Minister of the Interior and the representatives of Casa Pound, an explicitly neo-fascist force. And I would like to remind you, Prime Minister, that at the root of all fascism – Hannah Arendt teaches us this – is the process of dehumanisation of the other, the same process that is at the root of the war against people and migrants.  I proudly wear this sweatshirt, the sweatshirt I was wearing, like other MEMBERS of the European Parliament from other political groups, when I was on the Open Arms, just when the European Council was taking place. Well, this is not a uniform, one of those ones that, let me say, buffoonly wear some ministers of your government. This is a sign of solidarity. We received on the Open Arms the news that the Italian ports were closed for those 59 people who had been rescued at sea.  You referred to the conclusions of the European Council confirming the agreements with Turkey, voluntary relocation and the fight against flows. On the other hand, he did not refer to the European Parliament's position calling for a reform of the Dublin Regulation and a compulsory relocation process. You continue, Prime Minister, to give you this graph too, to say that the presence of NGOs at sea would increase departures. You have activating a process of criminalising NGOs unworthy of a civilised country, confusing those who help people with traffickers with a lie. That is why I am asking you, Prime Minister, as mayor Ada Colau has asked, to stop the disgraceful policy of closing ports and blocking NGOs. I would like to ask you whether a minister who is being investigated for kidnapping 177 people can really think of pointing out to the European Union the future with regard to migrant policies. Finally, on 8 March, Prime Minister, throughout Europe and also in Italy, women, feminists and those you forgot to mention in your speech will take to the streets. It is no coincidence, it has done well, because when this government talks about women's rights it only does negative things. I do not know whether you are aware that a delegation from the FEMM Committee went to Italy precisely to address the fact that the presence of medical objectors prevents the right to voluntary termination of pregnancy. I do not know whether you are aware that places of self-determination of women such as the International Women's House of Rome and the Luce and Siesta space are being evicted. I do not know whether you are aware of the fact that women are asking for ddl Pillon to be withered, that women are demanding with the anti-violence plan to finance anti-violence centres, an income of self-determination and a European minimum wage.  It is from these proposals that the future of Europe can really start again. We will continue to be partisan, because in order to save Europe from its sinking, we must oppose these European policies, but also the policies of your Government.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 259, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, Signor Presidente del Consiglio, benvenuto al Parlamento Europeo. Italy has bad press in European circles. And yet, when we think of your country, it is rather positive images that come to mind. It is in Italy that citizens have voted overwhelmingly in favour of keeping the common good of water in the public fold. It is in Italy, too, that citizens have spoken out against the return to the unpayable and risky energy that is nuclear power. It is still in Italy that the \"slow food\" movement was born, an antidote to junk food that is slowly killing our societies. And finally, it is Italy that has been able, in particular thanks to its fabric of small and medium-sized enterprises, to create three million green jobs. Yet your government, Mr Conte, confronts us with another reality and sometimes refers us to the worst hours this continent has experienced. Like when your Minister of the Interior, who sees himself as your true boss, affirms his dream of expelling from Italy the Roma and Sinti who live there. Your country is particularly vulnerable to climate change and facing a possible recession. And, in the face of this, your speech has shown us, you are turning your back on the opportunity to make the ecological transition the engine of the Italian and European economy. You might choose to listen to environmental whistleblowers, such as Rossella Muroni, innovative entrepreneurs like Catia Bastioli, or anti-speculation mayors like Matilde Casa. But instead, in the name of mythical growth, your government is tearing itself apart over pharaonic and senseless projects, such as the Tunnel of the Val de Susa or oil exploitation at sea, not to mention the continuous concreteization of your country, one of the most beautiful in Europe. This country has long faced a difficult budget equation. And if the share of responsibility of your predecessors is important, no one can deny that Italy has suffered greatly from the austerity policies imposed in the euro area since the Maastricht Treaty. But rather than seeking to build alliances to reform the euro area, so that our common currency benefits all Member States, your government chooses the path of a confrontation as theatrical as it is sterile which, far from reducing the risks, increases them. Finally, your country is on the front line of the challenge of asylum and migration. You could take the example of the dignity and determination of Pietro Bartolo, the doctor of Lampedusa, or Domenico Lucano, the mayor of Riace. Instead, your government makes migrants the scapegoats for all Italy's ills and closes its ports to ships that save Europe's honour by coming to the aid of refugees. You could seize the outstretched hand of our Parliament, which has adopted by a very large majority, the abandonment of the Dublin rule in favour of the European solidarity that you and your government are calling for. Indeed, the reform, as adopted by our Parliament, meets exactly the requirements of your government. But here, the 5-Star Movement opposed it while the League took refuge in abstention. Instead, your government prefers to associate itself with those who are merely preaching fortress Europe while leaving Italy abandoned to its fate. And if the migration issue is a problem for Italy, Prime Minister, I think it is rather to look on the side of the almost two million young Italians who have made the choice, free or forced, to leave their country in the last fifteen years. Do you really think that it is the confused and contradictory policies of your government that will encourage them to come back, and especially to encourage their brothers and sisters to stay in the country? On the contrary, we believe that it is by making Italy the engine of an ecological, solidarity and democratic transition that you will restore to your country a future that lives up to its history, at the height of its place within the European Union. And on our side, we will be with those who are mobilizing and preparing to launch, around these priorities, an \"onda verde e civica per l'Italia\".", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 260, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Laura AGEA", "mepid": "124811", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, Mr Katainen, Commissioner, colleagues and Prime Minister Conte. This is the 17th debate on the future of Europe, and the risk is that while we are debating the future, the Union no longer even has a present. We continue to regard Europe, which we founded, as our home. But the European Union needs a profound restructuring, because it was built from the roof, forgetting the foundations.  We want to give this house a solid, certain and lasting foundation. We want a fairer, fairer Europe, closer to its citizens, without second-class countries and second-class countries.  We want a Europe that is a leading player on the world stage, that does not get down to its knees by major powers such as Russia, China and the United States. We want a Union, not only in name, but also in fact. I ask you, does that mean being for or against Europe? Many have a habit of looking the straw in the eyes of others, but do not notice the beam that is in theirs.  Does being pro-European mean humiliating Greece and the Greeks, and then admitting - as if nothing had happened - that austerity was a huge mistake? Does being pro-European mean invoking solidarity between states and then leaving only one country to manage the burden of immigration? Does being pro-European mean creating tax havens in your own state? Furthermore, does being pro-European mean fighting with a stupid ideological war the introduction in Italy of the income of citizenship which - look at this - is a reality throughout Europe? These are false Pro-Europeans, who have built Europe, but those of banks and finance, bureaucracy and austerity far removed from the citizens. We still have time to change and we should take an example from Italy, where change is taking place today. In just seven months, we have taken away the life annuities of former Parliamentarians, compensated the defrauded savers of the banks, imposed the Daspo on the corrupt, cut gold pensions, lowered the tax on small VAT numbers and began paying 30 billion in public administration debts to entrepreneurs.  Finally today in Italy there is the income of citizenship. We dismantled the pension reform that Europe, yes Europe, had imposed on us the name of the rigour accounts. Commissioner Katainen, I am Umbrian. You spoke of Norcia, norcia needed only one thing: to unb away investment in reconstruction from the Stability and Growth Pact.  We have promised this to the citizens and we have achieved this because we do what we say. The recent Report \"Italy 2019\", published by the prestigious Eurispes institute, records an increase in the confidence of Italians in the government: fifteen points more than last year. We are not surprised, because the government of change, listening to the citizens, gives them new hope for the future.  That's why they accuse us of being populists.  Mr Conte, as you have already said, if that means listening to people, then yes, we are populists. All too often, however, in this building, locked in these cages, we forget to listen to the people.  Ladies and gentlemen, how many times have we asked you for a strong signal for the citizens, starting with, for example, the abolition of the dual seat of this Parliament? This structure, where we are today and which we occupy four days a month costs 200,000,000 EUROS every year, and has no reason to exist. And we are friends of the French, and I do not allow anyone to make any allegations about our support for the violent or the 'casseurs', all the more so as some have allowed themselves to call our government a government of lepers. I call for the waste of double seating to be erased: this is not an attack on democracy, democracy is not a privilege! Democracy cannot be a palace! Let us begin by cutting our salaries, our pensions and the monstrous salaries of commissioners, which really are a slap in the face for the citizens.

A government that proudly claims the sovereignty of our country, a government that does not bow its head and has the courage to say no to the boyars in Brussels, to say no to the berlin taxation, no to the manias of greatness of little Napoleon Macron, a government that finally defends the interests of the Italian people.  In recent months, the Lega and 5-star government has shown by its facts that change is possible. Thanks to our leader Matteo Salvini, wild immigration has been stopped. The security decree put an end to the business of illegal immigration. With the famous quota 100 we have begun to dismantle the Fornero law on pensions.  Mr Conte, much good has already been done, much more remains to be done. Autonomy must be given to Veneto, Lombardy and Emilia Romagna. There's a lot of tax reform to cut taxes. It must be made clear that Maduro is a communist dictator who must be wiped out and that Italy is one hundred percent with the people of Venezuela who want freedom. Mr Conte, we in the League are already at work, because after Italy we want to change Europe from top to bottom. And we will do so with the consent of the Italian people, who in the European elections will make the Salvini League the first party in Italy and the first party in all of Europe.  No more Europe as a slave to banks and multinationals. No more Europe of spread and austerity. No more Europe of Juncker, Merkel, Macron, who want to command at home and humiliate the Italian people. In Italy, Italian citizens rule, not Merkel or Macron. After the European elections we will have the strength and the numbers to build a new Europe, a Europe of peoples and freedom, a Europe capable of defending borders, stopping illegal immigration, protecting made in Italy, protecting our businesses and our workers.  Mr Conte, we are convinced that our government will last a long time, because we all have a great mission to fulfil: to defend our land from the bureaucrats in Brussels and to defend the freedom and sovereignty of the Italian people.

Thank you, Mr President. The issues that have been touched on are varied, ranging from issues of a clear European nature to other issues, on the other hand, which concern more closely the national policy followed by my government.  I am sorry that I am not going to answer one by one, but I will try to group together the issues that have been touched on. I shall begin with a subject that has been crossed a little and touched on by almost all the speeches: the issue of immigration. Everyone can have their own opinions, but I would like to remind you of what my government has done in practice, how we have dealt with the issue of immigration and what is the reality of the situation, then everyone will suffer the consequences. What we should perhaps not do is to obscure the reality of the situation, of how they unfolded.  From the first moment my government took office, it was fully aware that the issue of immigration was a divisive issue, it was a subject that had overwhelmed our country, with hundreds of thousands of landings in a few years. Italy has not been able, with previous policies, to withstand the impact of migratory flows, given our geographical condition. Some may forget this, but we are in the heart of the Mediterranean. So the routes, especially those in Central Africa, expose us directly to the impact of migratory flows.  Well, aware of what had happened, aware that an indiscriminate reception, as had been achieved in the past, means non-integration. Let us not approach the problem with hypocrisy: indiscriminate reception means non-integration. I am not going to name names, but also some of them, particularly a colleague of mine, a European Prime Minister, who had an attitude on the subject of immigration, as it were, a little detached, he told me, after he visited an Italian city in the North: 'Joseph, I understand now that you have a serious problem', after he saw dozens and dozens of immigrants on the streets.  How did we deal with it? We dealt with it immediately according to a structural approach, we understood that the emergency case leaves us all overwhelmed, we cannot manage it. And so we have drawn up a strategy, based on six premises, ten objectives ranging from the policy to be pursued in relations with the transit countries where the migratory flow originates, where these paths of hope originate, to the countries of transit, to the problem of European borders – including maritime borders, attention, which is not the same as land borders – to landing, to redistribution , to repatriations, and so on. I would like to remind you that Italy, at the first European Council in which I took part at the end of June, took an active part, as it were, with regard to those conclusions reached, where we reasoned for the first time with shared principles and efforts, where the principle was affirmed for the first time that those who land in Italy do not land in a non-European country , lands in Europe.  But there is one point: that once those principles have been affirmed, then the practical translation is still not found today. We have had a number of European Councils, but in fact we are unable to implement those principles accordingly. And certainly not because of Italy, of course, not because of Italy. Italy, then, I have to assume that it is true that it saved Europe's honour in the past, but perhaps some people thought that it would continue to save Europe's honour for the future. But this cannot be the case, it cannot be because any State that finds itself in Italy's position reaches a moment of saturation. Integration mechanisms no longer work, inclusion mechanisms no longer work, we know that there are difficulties with returns, because returns are not effective, because in many countries, it is not even possible to ascertain the identity of migrants, the origin, and in any case it is only possible on bilateral agreements, so objectively they cannot even be repatriated.  And then Italy decided to apply a line of greater rigour than in the past. Of course, we say it with our heads held high, we say it and we say it forcefully, with clarity and transparency: a line of greater rigour because we felt, having drawn up this articulated strategy, that we must not trivialise, no one can afford to trivialise, we felt that this was the only effective way to combat trafficking in human beings.  There is a problem, there is hypocrisy in Europe: migrants become a problem when the spotlight is turned on the Mediterranean, thanks also to some NGOs, then a mass media mechanism takes place, and then it becomes the problem of migrants. But we must ask ourselves the problem of migrants where they leave their village, where they immediately fall prey to the trafficking of these unscrupulous beings. You know how much a path of hope costs, punctuated by torture and personal violence? I've been around Africa a lot, I know what I'm talking about: it costs three thousand to five thousand dollars, and sometimes it's not enough. You think, we're talking about very poor people who can get this money and after a moment they get plundered, defrauded and raped. That is the problem, the problem is not just in the Mediterranean.  With regard to management then in the Mediterranean, I would like to point out that Italy, in search and rescue activities, rescue at sea, has always been inspired, always inspired by the protection of fundamental rights, and even in the case that has been mentioned, mentioned, of the \"Diciotti\", Italy first took the most vulnerable people, women and children, immediately transported them and brought them ashore. The fact that, as in the last case, there is a ship that comes to where health care, food supplies and so on is guaranteed, and a few days in the Italian port, in the roadstead, this does not mean that there is ill-treatment. But it was right, and I think it is right, in view of the conclusions that all 28 countries reached last June 2018, to demand that a redistributive mechanism work, which does not yet work, which cannot but be – on that I agree – on a mandatory basis. Attention, let us also come to the concrete. The safe haven only works if it is that of Italy, only if the landing is in Italy. This can't go well. Safe harbor doesn't mean nearer port. That is the first point. Secondly, the redistributive mechanism cannot work if there are only three, four, five or six countries, without an automatic mechanism. Everyone must be involved in this solidarity mechanism. Thirdly, there is a third problem, let us not hide it, even those countries that declare themselves willing to participate in the redistributive mechanism are only willing to do so with those who are entitled to international protection. Economic migrants nobody wants them, they stay in the country where they disembark. That is what we are about immigration. As far as the economy is concerned, you have dealt with the subject of the investment economy and infrastructure. Someone said: but Italy does not want to make the necessary reforms. Please inform yourself. During the mediation procedure with President Juncker, Vice-President Dombrovskis and Vice-President Moscovici, I, from the first moment I met them, did not ask for courtesy, to avoid the infringement procedure. I brought a full-bodied book, which I had translated into English, where there are all the reforms that we have already carried out and those that are being carried out. To say that Italy is not prepared to carry out reforms is simply to ignore what is happening in Italy. We have launched, we are achieving, the most far-biggest structural reform plan ever designed.

We have passed an anti-corruption law that introduces the highest anti-corruption standards not only in Europe but internationally. We have introduced a radical reform of bankruptcy. Today in Italy we are no longer talking about bankruptcy or bankruptcy: we are talking about the code of the crisis of companies and insolvency. It's a full-bodied book, a body of articles. We have introduced a delegation law and are now about to introduce delegated legislative decrees to reform and simplify all administrative procedures and streamline all procedures. That is what my country needs, which has never been done in recent years. We have a delegation law to introduce a radical reform of public procurement; we have a delegation law to reform the Civil Code, the Civil Trial Code and the Criminal Trial Code.  That's what we're doing. And when you tell us that we are against investment, perhaps because you follow the public debate and hear about TAV, who is in favour and who is not. But sorry, it's not that the TAV means the infrastructure investment plan in Italy. We have a substantial infrastructure investment plan, to which we have added as much as 13 billion from state-based companies, which have been summoned to Palazzo Chigi. We have a national plan: we are currently presenting a national plan for the security of the territory, a national plan against the risks of hydrogeological failure, for the modernization of our road infrastructure. I would like to remind you that we asked the Commission for flexibility, and we obtained it in the final phase of over EUR 3 billion – EUR 3 billion and EUR 200 million – in addition to the investment plan already planned.  And so, we can have differences of opinion – democracy is beautiful because when there is a public debate everyone can have opinions – but ignoring all this means doing european citizens, not just Italian citizens, a disape. As far as the TAV is concerned, it is true that it is a project that was also recognised as being of European interest and was already launched. , is in its early stages. So, before we committed so many resources, before we build an infrastructure that has such a big impact on the environment, we decided to do a cost-benefit analysis. We have said that we will do so in transparency, we will share the results publicly and we will take responsibility for the resulting decision. As far as the other projects are concerned, they are all being implemented. The TAP, the third pass, the Brenner motorway and so on. And by the way, precisely in order to accelerate investment, we have a plan, which we will make public these days, for all the construction sites in progress. A final joke – excuse me, Mr President, if I am abusing time – but a final joke about foreign policy choices. We are told: political isolation. Italy is in political isolation, Italy has obstructed Venezuela and has remained isolated. Attention: first of all, Italy is not isolated. Italy contributed, I would like to remind you – and this is a fact – to the communiqué by the High Representative, and therefore of the entire European Union, of 26 January. It has been acknowledged, even publicly, that my speech was decisive for that communiqué. Attention: many want to anticipate history. Caution should be exercised. We do not know what the evolution of the Venezuelan crisis will be. Italy has clear ideas and is not alone, it is with many other countries. We have clear ideas that, I would like to remind you, for us the presidential elections of last 2018 are not democratic elections. We didn't recognize them. Clear? We also have clear ideas that we need new presidential elections and that the conditions must be ensured for them to be conducted transparently and to be credible by international standards. We want them as soon as possible. We are aware that there is a population that is suffering and so we are pressing for an emergency and we have already allocated resources for humanitarian aid in accordance with international law. We are aware that no regime can be justified if it adopts violence and suppresses dissent and peaceful demonstrations through violence.  Having said that, we do not believe that we can crown anyone who does not go through free and democratic elections. That's what we're going to work for. (Applause) We are an active part of the contact group; we are also available for a form of mediation and we all warn against the historical responsibility of crowning someone at the expense of the other, when we know full well that the major international crises, historically, have occurred because there has been a rush to crown one leading actor over the other in contention.  Attention: because this polarizes and radicalizes the clash. It is clear that rushing to crown one actor means allowing other global actors to come to the rescue of the other, and we know that this has created the worst crises that are still dragging on in history.

I want to talk to you about the Lyon-Turin, which is incredible here to hear that it is still a project. In reality, the Lyon-Turin does not only connect two cities, just as the Channel Tunnel does not connect Dover to Calais, but the whole of the United Kingdom with the rest of the Union.

It is true that some revenues will be down, such as taxes on fuel and on the proceeds of motorway tolls. Yes, there will be less traffic, fewer trucks, but above all less pollution. My question, Prime Minister, is this: do you not think that the old and fraternal link between our two countries deserves better than this Ponti report, where there is no methodological rigour or environmental concern?", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 271, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Bernd LUCKE", "mepid": "124820", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to thank the Prime Minister, thank you very much for what you have said.

But when we talk about solidarity, we must of course also talk about why there has been a situation in the first place where Italy must demand this solidarity. I would like to point out once again that we have had a common currency for 20 years: the euro. And Italy has not had growth for 15 years. Have you ever thought about whether there might be a connection?  Could it be that Italy itself needs to think about whether this common currency is actually suitable for the country, to think about where it comes from, that the Italian central bank is pushing ahead with a target deficit of 400 billion euros, why Italy has increased its debt by a third since the euro was introduced, which is why Italy is constantly violating the rules on its deficit. , violates the Fiscal Compact?

I am interested as you see in relations with Slovenia and Croatia and as you see the future of cooperation on the Adriatic. It is also important to me how you see the enlargement of the European Union. I am also interested if your government wants to cut funding for the Italian minority in Istria, for bilingualism in Istria, which I did with my colleagues. I am interested in what you want to do with bilingualism in Slovenia and Croatia, because we also need Italian Union funding in Slovenia and Croatia.

Other speeches should not be commented on because they have obviously thought of offending not only myself, but the entire people that I represent.

Perhaps puppets are the ones that respond to lobbies, power groups and business committees.

Thank you, Mr President, but I come to the political questions that have been raised, some very interesting ones. I would like to answer a specific question: I have been asked for support for Cyprus and Greece. I would like to remind you that on 29 January I was in Nicosia, where we also held a joint final press conference with seven other countries in Southern Europe, took specific positions and therefore support for Cyprus has already taken place. As far as the other issues are concerned, however, shameful things have been said for Italy, for example that we allow children to die at sea. But this is a falsehood of unprecedented gravity! It is a falsehood of unprecedented gravity. I said it earlier: we have a duty to inform ourselves if we speak here. I said earlier that we have always taken action to ensure protection for the most vulnerable people, even in the most glaring and emergency cases we have immediately secured women and children, had them transhipped to other ships or disembarked. If we have taken stock, it was because we really want concrete solidarity, that we move from principles to deeds in Europe and that the other countries also behave accordingly. With regard to the issue with France, I have said it several times: Italy has an ancient link, not only economic but also cultural, with France. To think that the relationship between the two countries is called into question by a disagreement, by a single divergence, is something crazy. We are two culturally and economically integrated systems, so none of this. Vice-President Di Maio, moreover, said that the meeting he had with some members of the gilets jaunes movement was, of course, done in his capacity as leader of a political movement. So we enter into a dimension, that of political dialectics, where choices may be questionable, but they are legitimate.  As far as Venezuela is concerned, something has also been said here that is blatantly false: that Italy supports Maduro, that Italy does not press for the presidential elections, that I said that there is no hurry. But all our statements are the opposite. The Maduro regime is by no means supported by Italy. We have stated that the presidential elections, the whole of the European Parliament, have not recognised them. We have not sent anyone, we have not endorsed them at all, we do not believe that President Maduro has democratic legitimacy. We are calling for free presidential elections as soon as possible – do we write it in large billboards? – free, democratic and transparent as soon as possible, precisely because there is a population that is suffering. And we simply do not believe that this result is achieved by siding with and elevating and recognising as president someone who has proclaimed himself as such. We believe that this, on the contrary, slows down the process leading to a rapid and democratic solution.  The subject of the economy and the fact that we have been asked why Italy is not paying attention to an industrial policy, including a European one, has still been touched on. We have recognised the importance of the Juncker Plan – as I have also said – we have always supported the importance of an EU industrial policy, and we have also stressed the importance of a budget for the eurozone, even with a stabilising function.  Again to stay on the subject of economic and social policy, we were told: but why, do you see that you are not growing? But be ware, but should we discount past economic policies? Perhaps it is still a little early, it is still a little early to assess the effects of an economic manoeuvre that now contains measures, which are now still being implemented, are still being implemented. In fact, I have reasoned for an economic recovery that will develop in the second half of 2019 because, reasonably, our economic policy, our measures will not be able to be fully implemented in these very first months.  And to think that we are not attentive to production and the production system, to think that we are not engaging in the investment plan, is something – as I said before – completely wrong. We are working on this, I will just tell you that yesterday, to give an example, I was in three regions of southern Italy, where economic growth is struggling compared to others, where there is no social development, to sign three development contracts: Basilicata, Molise and Sardinia. This government has a very practical, pragmatic approach, and absolutely seeks to support economic growth with all the measures it has implemented. Citizenship income, you see, could also be a purely welfare measure. There has been a lot of talk about this, I am talking about this measure because it has catalysed the public debate a little. This measure could be merely a waste of resources, a welfare measure. In fact, it was conceived on the basis of a work pact, a training pact and social inclusion mechanisms to recover many people – we are talking about five million poor people who will be directly affected – who at the moment are absolutely outside any social, productive, working mechanism, and therefore in accordance with article 3, second paragraph , of our wonderful Italian Constitution, have no real chance of participating in the economic, democratic, political and social life of our country.

Meanwhile, in the grip of propaganda fury, Italy is isolating and it is not understood how we want to be in this Europe. From here, Mr Conte, everything seems meaningless. You have made alliances with countries that will never help Italy on migrants, and you have deteriorated your relationship with France, which has come to recall its ambassador from Rome. Some of your ministers sympathise in the home of others with the most violent fringes of jaunes gilets and cross the border without respecting the procedures laid down for state summits.

It’s been over a decade in the making, the Free Trade Agreement between the EU and Singapore, but after many twists and turns, we are at last at the final stage. I’d like to begin by thanking the Government of Singapore for its patience and support, and in particular their Ambassador for his good cooperation. I’d also like to thank the Commissioner and DG Trade for an agreement that I believe we can readily support in this House, and above all, I’d like to thank my shadow rapporteurs for what has been great cooperation. My question to those who are still sceptical is: frankly, what is not to like about this free trade agreement? It builds on Canada and Japan and sends the message that the EU is committed to a rules-based trading system. While Donald Trump wants to build walls to separate nations, we are tearing them down, keeping fair and free trade alive. Singapore is a safe harbour for EU trade and investment, and what a harbour! An important market in its own right, thanks to its unshakable commitment to the rule of law, it has one of the highest per capita incomes in the world and now has more than 10 000 EU companies based there. Many of them are looking forward, as a result of this FTA, to expanding their activities and vying for public sector contracts in Singapore. Singapore is important in its own right, but it’s also of key strategic importance for accessing the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) region, one of the fastest growing regions in the world. Singapore is a major hub, through which a large percentage of our exports pass, and, with the entry into force of the Trans-Pacific Partnership of 11 countries, if we do nothing we will lag behind those nations. So in economic terms this clearly is a win—win trade deal. In addition to the trade benefits, however, I would also argue that the agreement clearly reflects EU values and positions espoused by this Parliament in very many of our resolutions. For example, nothing in this agreement will prevent the application of the precautionary principle or affect the right of governments to regulate in the interest of their citizens. Public services are protected: the agreement uses the positive list for services, always the preferred option of this Parliament. Imports will have to respect EU standards. It contains commitments on the environment, in respect of the management of forests and fisheries, for example, and a commitment to implement multilateral agreements, including the Paris Agreement. I particularly welcome Singapore’s agreement to the early implementation of the Trade and Sustainable Development chapter and the commitment to take concrete steps to ratify the outstanding three core International Labour Organisation (ILO) conventions. They are serious about this. Singapore has already held talks with the social partners, they are already in dialogue with the ILO and they’ve set up an interministerial working group to see how they can bring domestic legislation into line with the three ILO conventions. Moving on to the Investment Protection Agreement, I believe this is the most progressive investment agreement we have so far negotiated, and it should be a model to build on for future agreements. I want to thank the Commissioner and her team for listening to Parliament’s concerns about the old and toxic investor-state dispute settlement system. This investment court system will have a permanent tribunal composed of judges or jurors of recognised competence, not arbiters. There will be a code of conduct for judges, proceedings will be transparent, the system will have an appeal mechanism, it contains a commitment to joint efforts towards a multilateral investment court, and it protects governments’ right to regulate. It is also worth mentioning that this replaces the existing 13 bilateral investment treaties that Member States already have. The last point I want to make is that this agreement has one major weakness, which, I believe, should be addressed in future investment agreements. It gives investors rights but it gives them no obligations. We have to look forward to giving them obligations in the future. With that caveat, I’m pleased to commend both of these agreements to this Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 303, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  Thank you very much, Mr Martin.

Fifteen years have passed since the Council authorized the Commission to negotiate an agreement with Singapore, and it was time to complete this procedure. Tomorrow we take a step forward by voting on our consent to the Framework Agreement on Collaboration and Cooperation and the Free Trade and Investment Protection Agreements. Today, once again, we send a strong message about the European Union's commitment to international cooperation and multilateralism, to others — we already know who. In a world where international cooperation is questioned, the European Union stands firm and points to the importance of international cooperation. This Agreement with Singapore seeks to institutionalize relationships dating back several decades and is based on a long history of friendship and close historical, political and economic ties. The new legal framework for bilateral relations will provide a strengthening of cooperation between Singapore and the European Union. The objective is to cooperate on issues such as justice, security, climate change, development; issues to which our citizens are very attentive. I remember the geostrategic importance of Singapore. It is an essential player in ensuring regional stability and balance in the Asia-Pacific region. And the security and stability of the region is important for Europe, European businesses and Europeans. Indeed, Singapore is the gateway to the Asian market and a platform for European companies, strategically located among the major economies that are China, India and Japan. These agreements improve the investment climate and will offer greater certainty to European investors. I would like to stress that, within the framework of this Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, we are going to set up a Standing Joint Committee, a committee composed of representatives from both sides at a high level who will have the mission of working on a daily basis to meet the established objectives of cooperation. We will be privileged partners in making decisions on issues such as international security, scientific and technological cooperation; in sectors such as energy, the environment, natural resources and transport, in particular maritime and air transport. We will cooperate on information society issues and, above all, cybersecurity. It is important to cooperate on these issues, because it is a global field that knows no borders, and because our companies lose millions with computer attacks, and together we can anticipate attacks and coordinate that fight. We will also increase – very importantly – existing cultural exchanges as well as education programmes for young Europeans – Erasmus Mundus, among others – and support new business and employment opportunities for our young people. Singapore can become that platform for our young people towards the Asian labour market. I would also like to point out the importance of this Agreement for global security and the fight against terrorism. The only way to combat this scourge that puts our welfare model in check is by establishing bridges of cooperation with other countries, exchanging data and information, stopping funding and thus making terrorist attacks impossible wherever they occur. This Agreement means a window open to all European entrepreneurs and companies so that they can establish trade relations, not only with Singapore, but also with other Asian countries. More than 10,000 companies and entrepreneurs in the European Union are based in Singapore and use it as a hub to serve the entire Pacific region. A stable legal framework is the cornerstone of any partnership agreement. By giving European entrepreneurs and companies legal certainty in their relations with Singapore, we are opening up new business opportunities, promoting their investments, growth and expansion. Whenever our citizens can freely and safely develop their business ideas and projects, we are creating the right environment to drive new jobs. I have mentioned issues such as climate change before, and I want to emphasize this. Singapore's geopolitical importance in responding to natural and humanitarian disasters in South-East Asia is crucial. The European Union will now have a privileged platform to cooperate and participate in Singapore's climate change policy decision-making process, providing our know-how in the fight against change climate policy, a key policy of our Union. Finally, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs in all this work for their help and cooperation in this report, and I am confident that tomorrow we will be able to approve with a large majority this Framework Agreement on Collaboration and Cooperation with Singapore. I believe that this is a huge achievement for all of us and, of course, a source of stability, employment and a guarantee of the future, also for our international relations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 305, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me start by thanking the two rapporteurs, David Martin and Antonio López-Istúriz White, for the good work they have done and the long journey that we have travelled jointly, which has brought us to where we are today. Few places symbolise the benefits of trade and investments like Singapore. Singapore’s determination in embracing openness and globalisation has transformed a city state without natural resources into one of the most prosperous countries in the world and has helped its people prosper too. Singapore has become a model of economic transformation and a prime example of how trade, investment and sustainable development can and should go hand in hand. Embracing openness has served the EU well in the past, too, and still shines a light on the way forward as we discuss the issues facing us today. Close partners for decades, the EU and Singapore have decided to seal our partnership through the three agreements that we are talking about today and that you will vote on tomorrow. The new EU-Singapore Partnership and Cooperation Agreement will lay down the overall framework for bilateral political cooperation between two like-minded partners. But we are also very close investment and trade partners. Singapore is currently our largest trade and investment partner in south-east Asia and among our top 20 trading partners for goods, our top five for services and our top ten partners for foreign direct investment. The trade and investment agreements between the EU and Singapore will provide a framework for these already strong flows to develop further. The benefits of the trade agreement are many. Tariffs on bilateral trade will be removed. Non-tariff barriers on EU exports for cars, electronics and renewables we’ll do away with. Access to service procurement markets will be improved, and all this will create opportunities for businesses and for individuals on both sides. The agreement further contains a comprehensive trade and sustainable development chapter that includes obligations in relation to international conventions on workers’ rights and the environment; covers areas like biodiversity, eco-labelling and corporate and social responsibility; and gives a strong role to EU and Singapore civil society groups in making sure that these commitments are put into practice. Ratification of, and compliance with, International Labour Organisation (ILO) fundamental conventions will figure among priority items to focus and deliver on. We need to see sustained efforts in this respect, as of the agreement’s entry into force. And here already the Singaporean authorities have shown good engagement in preparing for the implementation of the agreement’s sustainable development provisions. The trade agreement was also negotiated together with an investment protection agreement that contains the fully reformed investment protection system developed at EU level, which the European Parliament requested and helped to shape – and I would like to thank you for this support. This system addresses the concerns civil society has expressed about vaguely defined rules, lack of transparency, absence of appeal, lack of independence of adjudicators and lack of accountability in bilateral investment agreements that we have today. So, delivering on the negotiating mandate, the Commission has presented for consent an agreement that tightens the standards on investment protection so as to prevent abuses, an agreement that fully safeguards a government’s right to make new laws to protect health, the environment and other public interests. It thus establishes a fully transparent investment court system, a system which, in the very recent opinion of the Advocate-General in relation to a trade agreement with Canada, has been considered fully compatible with the EU Treaties. That is a stepping-stone towards the multilateral investment courts that could potentially cover all 3 000 existing investment agreements worldwide and could play a central role in the future development of investment policy, including a possible evolution to include investors’ obligations, as Mr Martin mentioned. So these trade and investment agreements negotiated with Singapore are state-of-the-art agreements with a privileged bilateral trade and investment partner to the EU. And, beyond being a partner, Singapore is a beating commercial heart of the south-east Asian region so, in that sense, the agreement will constitute a benchmark for negotiation with other Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) partners. Lastly, on the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, this is, of course, a stepping stone towards enhanced political and economic involvement between the EU and Singapore, as well as the whole region. It provides a basis, as the rapporteur mentioned, for effective bilateral engagement with Singapore, strengthening the political dialogue and enhancing cooperation in a variety of areas – human and labour rights, justice, security, connectivity, people-to-people links, the information society, education and cultural exchanges, as well as employment and social affairs. It will enable us to step up scientific and technological cooperation in areas such as energy, environment, the fight against climate change, protection of natural resources, smart cities and transport. Under this agreement, a joint committee will be established comprising representatives of both sides at an appropriately high level to ensure the proper functioning of the agreement and see that it is implemented. It will also set priorities and make recommendations to promote the agreement’s objectives. On regional dynamics, Singapore has advocated regional multilateralism in South-east Asia and is currently the country coordinator for EU-ASEAN dialogue relations. We value that partnership very much and we are committed to ensuring that it will become even stronger. The collaboration with Singapore on ASEAN-related matters has been very fruitful so far. Cooperation between Singapore and the EU is already deep and wide today and, given the challenges that we are jointly facing, the potential for even greater engagement is significant – founded on a shared vision, a rule-based multilateral system and effective multilateralism. So thank you to the European Parliament for the work that has been done here. We are looking forward to strong support in tomorrow’s vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 306, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, firstly my thanks to rapporteurs David Martin and Antonio López-Istúriz White for their great work and cooperation on this issue, and also to all the shadow rapporteurs.

The value of trade between Singapore and the European Union is, for the European Union exports, EUR 55 billion, and, for the exports from Singapore to us, EUR 44 billion. That trade is set to grow rapidly and enormously with this very good Free Trade Agreement (FTA), and I compliment Commissioner Malmström for her work in that regard. Many areas will benefit. I know that, in Ireland, the agricultural sector will benefit hugely, and that will be very important to them, as they are concerned about what might happen with our exports to the United Kingdom post Brexit. This shows that the European Union is working for them and for us, and is planning ahead. I would also like to say that the removal of tariffs and non-tariff barriers is going to help a whole host of businesses, and the Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), which I must mention briefly, is a wonderful, progressive proposal dealing with the problems around investor-state dispute settlement.

The European Union, after the vacuum left by the United States, is establishing itself as the absolute protagonist on the global trade stage. Our third way to trade, which is antithetical to protectionism and unbridled liberalism, has never been more attractive. Thanks to this partnership we are able to project our standards and values globally. Thanks to the clauses on the protection of workers, consumers and the environment, we are able to protect citizens from the side effects of globalisation.  To name a few, I am referring to singapore's commitments to ratify the World Labour Organisation conventions, to respect the Paris climate agreement, but also to recognise our geographical indications, such as PDOs, OCDs. Not only that: we cannot forget that more than 90% of global economic growth in the coming years will take place outside our borders. These agreements therefore provide a fundamental outlet for supporting employment and growth. Singapore is the gateway to the ASEAN region in South-East Asia, the most dynamic economic region in the world: markets that are increasingly important for our European productions, and I am not referring to the large multinationals: more than 80% of European companies in Singapore are small and medium-sized enterprises. Exports to Singapore have guaranteed 33 billion euros in turnover to our companies.  Will the agreement, by increasing these numbers, create thousands of jobs in Europe and at what cost? No one, singapore's economy is totally complementary to the European economy: from the industrial sector to the agricultural sector, no sector of our economic system is in competitive conflict with Singapore. Faced with these facts, with these numbers, we must have no doubt: these agreements are fundamental for European workers, whose products are sold and appreciated throughout the world and for citizens, who will receive greater protection against the possible adverse side effects of globalisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 308, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Charles TANNOCK", "mepid": "4521", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, the EU—Singapore Free Trade Agreement (FTA) is yet another example of the EU’s highly successful global free trade agenda – we’ve just heard about the conclusion of the Japan agreement – that is opening up markets across the world for all of the EU’s current 28 Member States. As Britain stands just 45 days away from leaving the European Union, I’m reminded once again of all the disingenuous untruths and false promises peddled by the Brexiteers in the Leave campaign. One of those was that Britain needed to leave the European Union in order to strike optimal trade deals with the Commonwealth and the Anglosphere countries that the EU was neither interested in nor capable of concluding in the UK’s bilateral interest. Yet here we are today discussing an EU trade deal with Singapore, a Commonwealth and ASEAN country, following on from the EU’s FTA with Canada whilst talks on FTAs with Australia and New Zealand are now in advanced stages. Far from the UK needing to leave the EU to improve trading links with the Commonwealth, it seems patently obvious that, following 29 March, the EU—27 will enjoy far better opportunities to trade with the Commonwealth than the UK will for many years to come.

The clear vote in favour on the Free Trade Agreement that we had in the Committee on International Trade (INTA) last month reflects this excellent cooperation. I also want to thank the Ambassador of Singapore and his Government for their cooperation and patience. I strongly support both the Free Trade Agreement and the Investment Protection Agreement. This is a win—win fair deal for both sides and for both consumers and companies. Negotiations between the EU and Singapore were launched in December 2009. Nearly 10 years later, here we are, finally. Singapore is by far the EU’s largest partner in Asia, accounting for almost a third of EU—Asian trade in goods and services. More than 10 000 European companies have their regional offices in Singapore and they operate in a reliable business and regulatory environment. Singapore is also a trade and transport hub to Asia and a gateway to the major growth economies of the world. This agreement can be a model for other Asian countries as it is the first in this region. With regard to the Investment Protection Agreement (IPA), it replaces 13 old bilateral investment treaties between individual Member States and Singapore. Tomorrow, I hope we will vote in favour of a new and modern investment court system. The IPA protects the parties’ right to regulate and to achieve legitimate policy objectives in areas such as public health, safety and the environment. Moreover, there is no protection of investors’ profit expectation. Furthermore, the Investment Protection Agreement defines fair and equitable treatment, preventing forum shopping and parallel claims, among other things. Lastly, I want to recognise Commissioner Malmström’s efforts to improve dialogue, accountability and transparency. Growth in Europe comes with trade and not with more public debt.

Mr President, I have three serious objections to the investment protection agreement with Singapore. This agreement again includes a paragraph on ISDS, investor-state arbitration. Yes, I know you call it different, but that's what it is. We know that companies can make claims if governments make justifiable decisions that threaten their profits. And the taxpayer is paying for that. It undermines the rule of law and democracy. Secondly, the agreement offers exclusive rights to investors, but does not include enforceable rules to achieve the sustainability goals. This puts pressure on the interests of people, animals and the environment. Thirdly, the agreement explicitly allows foreign investors to buy up government bonds. In the event of a crisis, these investors can then block restructuring of public debt. The way in which Parliament and this Commission prioritise the interests of multinationals in general, and the financial sector in particular, over the interests of citizens is unacceptable. Nearly half a million people have signed a petition against ISDS in recent weeks to stop such treaties. My call to you is: stop ISDS. Stop these kinds of trade treaties.

I congratulate Singapore on finally achieving their goal now that they have the responsibility for coordinating the EU-ASEAN dialogue.  The agreements show that Europe is seeking increased cooperation with Asia in order to realise our values and interests. We need strategic partnership. We also want a strategic partnership with ASEAN to pursue security and development in the Indo-Pacific region. We want to strengthen connectivity between the EU and Asia and we want to work together multilaterally. Finally, we want the full application of human rights, from freedom of expression and assembly, to the abolition of the death penalty, and environmental and social progress. But I must raise a problem, and I am saying this in English so that the Singaporeans will understand: public debt titles should not be covered by investment protection agreements (IPAs). Since the financial crisis of 2007, the EU has had standards and procedures if a government defaults on its debt and the debt needs restructuring. Here, the Singapore IPA creates a loophole. As the German business daily Handelsblatt writes today: 'The IPA increases the threshold for investor consent in debt-restructuring procedures vis—a—a—vis the level that otherwise exists in the EU.' Investors that operate under this IPA would be privileged over other investors. That's unacceptable.

But one thing is certain: we will oppose the Investment Treaty, because it contains that infamous special court, which only allows the demands of the multinationals to be pursued, something to which we had already strongly opposed with CETA and we will continue to fight here too.

Trade for all, which the Commission so often advocates, continues to be a long way off.

Sustainability, workers' rights and environmental standards play a minor or no role in comparison. Singapore has not ratified and implemented the eight core labour standards. We therefore need the possibility of sanctions for infringements. But even these are searched in vain in this text.

Singapore is a major modern open hub for trade services and investment and a strong partner in the south-east Asian region in general. But this agreement will not make the Singaporeans become exactly like us and neither will we copy them. As always, we are responsible for setting our own laws and standards. I’m very happy to see that we have been able to convince the Singaporeans to replace the outdated 13 agreements that included Investor-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) chapters between different Member States of the EU and Singapore and replace them with the Investment Court System. We pushed for that and it’s good to see the results. It guarantees more transparency, maintains our right to regulate and creates an appeals mechanism; a greater role for civil society.

Anyway, Singapore is a success story. Singapore now has a bigger GDP per capita than Germany, but Singapore is not – repeat, not – part of a very large trading bloc. Perhaps the ill—informed UK Remainers will note that basic fact. The EU—Singapore deal is a success for free-trade principles and, by the way, to respond to a point made earlier, this agreement has now been signed 45 years after the UK originally joined the EU. The EU’s method of trade agreements is a bit like Strictly Come Dancing: slow, slow, quick, quick, slow. Under the agreement, tariffs will be abolished entirely on a wide range of manufactured goods, and between the EU and Singapore there will be mutual recognition of professional qualifications. But what the agreement does not require is freedom of movement of people. This demonstrates again that free trade and free movement can be – indeed are – entirely separate. Now to Brexit. The EU grants Singapore the abolition of tariffs but, at the same time, the EU sabre-rattles about a hard tariff border with the UK. For Singapore, the EU liberalises trade in services. At the same time, the EU scaremongers about impeding the existing trade in services between the EU and the UK. One day perhaps, the EU will show the same sound commercial sense towards the UK that it is currently showing towards Singapore. However, I have to say it’s probable that that day will come only when the current President of the Council, Donald Tusk, finds his own special place in hell.

The real risk, ladies and gentlemen, is that the advantage of this Treaty will be felt by other players who are not part of the European Union and who do not respect the parameters set for commercial processing.

There are no guarantees of combating this phenomenon, which is very present in Asia and of which Italian industry is one of the main victims. We risk opening our doors to cheap taroccati products, of Malaysian, Chinese or Indonesian origin, which in Singapore see only the last stage of processing. Many doubts also remain about protected geographical indications. The system in force in Singapore does not provide for the existence of a register. Our geographical indications will not be automatically protected, but European operators will have to activate the procedures themselves. Singapore is also a global financial centre and the reciprocal liberalisation of financial services is precisely one of the main aims of the agreement, but it could make it possible to circumvent European financial regulations in this area.

Public debt is excluded from this. The Investment Protection Agreement (IPA) is very clear on excluding the EU sovereign debt restructuring from the investment protection, so here you can be calm. Investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) does not exist anymore in the European Union. We have replaced it – very much at your demand and with your help, cooperation and push, and I thank you for that – with a new modern system that the Advocate General declared perfectly compatible with EU laws. It does away with many of the flaws of ISDS. There are full—term arbitrators with a code of conduct, there is full transparency, there is an appeal mechanism, there are very clear limits on what can be brought to the table, and it says that states have the right to regulate. Singapore is not on the list of non—cooperative jurisdictions for tax evasion.  On geographical indications (GIs), it is true that this still remains to be done. Singapore is about to establish a register to protect the GIs to which the European Union countries can apply for protection of the 196 geographical indications that were on the consulting list and the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) will enter into force only when there is satisfactory compliance with this. It is true that Singapore still has to ratify three ILO Conventions, but hard work is ongoing inside the Government of Singapore and cooperation with the ILO to make sure that legislation is in compliance with these three Conventions and that they are eventually ratified. As was referred to, there has been a letter from the Government of Singapore on this process.  If – and I hope you will – this House votes strongly in favour of these agreements tomorrow, you will vote for an ambitious FTA, which will be a reference for many other upcoming agreements in the ASEAN region. You will vote in favour of an Investment Protection Agreement that follows the approach that you have helped to shape.  You will also help to frame the broader cooperation between the EU and Singapore, giving our relations a solid and broad foundation in areas such as security, people—to—people contact, research etc., through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and it will be the first agreement that is endorsed by this Parliament following the new modern architecture.  With this we are expanding the circle of friends that we are setting up with like-minded countries, countries who believe in multilateralism, countries who believe in global rules and norms, and countries who believe that we can make mutually beneficial, fair and sustainable trade agreements with friends and with whom we are contributing to shaping globalisation.

Evidence of the rollback of women's rights in the European Union does not allow omissions. In the last decade, women's labour, economic, social and cultural rights have been severely compromised. Right-wing policies, sponsored or imposed since the European Union, have led to an increase in the precarious employment of labour relations. Low-wage policies, the deregulation of working hours, the raising of the retirement age, which impose multiple discrimination on women. At the same time, social responses and public services have been degraded. The degradation or absence of public services that guarantee care and care, whether in childhood or in situations of disease or in old age, constitutes an ignoble disresponsibility of states in the responses to the needs of populations, contributing to situations that keep women from the labor market. The protection of motherhood, determined by law, is compromised by the enormous pressure on workers to give up their rights, a direct consequence of the precariousemployment of employment ties. The degradation of the public supply of health services and the offensive against the right to sexual and reproductive health is another element of attack on women's rights.  Attempts to reverse or prevent the consecration of rights in the voluntary termination of pregnancy and to ensure proper reproductive health care are known and unacceptable. Global levels of poverty and unemployment, which particularly affect women, remain at unsustainable levels. The gender pay and pension gap persists at unacceptable values. The increase in violence against women, which has been seen in the same period, cannot be disconnected from the cutting of rights and the degradation of the socio-economic conditions of the population. Nine women and one child have been killed in my country since the beginning of the year. These figures are a brutal and growing expression in the European Union of the multiple forms of violence against women, be it domestic violence or sexual violence and harassment, violence and harassment in the workplace, violence and exploitation in prostitution. The consecration of equality and the fight against violence in law, whether in the national or international field, of which the Istanbul Convention is an example, are important and necessary steps, but it is not enough to enshrine it in law. There can be no place for make-believe policies in equality policies or quick terms of combating all forms of violence.  The success of preventing, combating and eradicating violence against women in its multiple forms is inseparable from the realising of women's rights in law and in life. It is necessary to establish specific programmes for the protection and monitoring of victims, measures to strengthen social support, access to justice, shelters, mental health care in the fields of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation, responses that ensure economic autonomy and ensure, in practice, the confidence and security that the law actually protects , women who are victims of violence at various stages until they remake their lives. The path of economic and social emancipation of women is decisive in the construction of equality and combating all forms of violence. This requires putting work as a central element to address inequalities between men and women. Equality in life that requires combating unemployment and labour precarity, valuing wages and eliminating wage discrimination, women's equal participation in all sectors of activity, the right to be a mother and worker with rights, the social protection of motherhood and paternity in the personal areas of health and social security, the creation of a public network of child support equipment , young people, the elderly, people with disabilities and victims of violence, access to the National Health Service and protection in sexual and reproductive health, the protection of women who are victims of prostitution and trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and moral or sexual harassment in the workplace. Combating equality and against all forms of violence is a fight for all, a fight that requires states to take responsibility and to claim, in fact, as an irreplaceable element of consecration of equality and combating all forms of violence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 5, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 348, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, Europe is confronted with increased populist and extremist trends which also manifest themselves in sexist and racist hate speech and in backward trends regarding women’s and girls’ rights. The Commission, with the support of High Representative Mogherini, has put gender equality at the centre of the EU’s internal and external action. The Strategic Engagement for Gender Equality for the years 2016-2019 has been our framework for the promotion of gender equality and gender mainstreaming in the EU and beyond. In 2019 we are taking stock of progress, identifying gaps and preparing the setting of priorities for the future. In this context, the views of the European Parliament are very welcome. I also warmly welcome the agreement reached on the work—life balance proposal. This will offer more choices for parents and carers in terms of reconciling family and professional life. In November 2017, the Commission adopted an action plan to tackle the gender pay gap, which comprises a broad and coherent set of more than 20 concrete actions. The majority of these have been implemented and the remaining measures should be concluded this year. Reliable data are essential in order to monitor trends in gender equality in the EU. That is why Eurostat is currently developing an EU survey on gender-based violence, with the aim of having updated statistics, following on from the EU—wide survey by the Fundamental Rights Agency in 2014. Eradicating gender—based violence has been a key priority for the Commission. We have just finished a second year of targeted action and awareness raising. We are continuing to push ahead on EU accession to the Istanbul Convention on gender—based violence. With regard to ratification by the Member States, as of today 20 Member States have ratified this Council of Europe convention but, as you know, ratification is being seriously challenged in other countries. The political and public debate around the Istanbul Convention is a good illustration of the impact of the current backlash against gender equality and women’s rights in Europe. Misleading arguments about the convention and its measures are being used in public debate. We must confront these and explain that the sole purpose of the convention is to prevent and combat violence against women and domestic violence against children, women and men, without any hidden purposes or effects. This situation is paralysing some Member States in the process towards ratification of the convention and the EU’s accession to it. Time is running out if we are to conclude that process before the end of this Parliament’s term. Gender equality is not only a core value of the EU but it is also central to the Union’s external action. I am glad that this Parliament has welcomed the good progress made on implementing international cooperation and development under the EU Gender Action Plan. This plan focuses on the enhancement of women’s integrity, economic and social rights and on participation and the elimination of gender—based violence. The Council has welcomed a new and ambitious EU strategic approach to ‘Women, Peace and Security’, which explicitly combines internal and external policies and requires analysis of, and response to, the gender-related root causes of inequalities, violence and conflict. Lastly, we need to continue our sustained efforts. This is one of the reasons why, in September 2017, the EU and the United Nations jointly launched the Spotlight initiative with the objective of eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls worldwide. Backed by an initial contribution of EUR 500 million, our ambition is to see this initiative being transformational for the lives of women and girls worldwide, in particular for young people and those living in the most marginalised and vulnerable situations. The Commission will continue its engagement in the field.

And there are lengthy experiments and research showing that when women suffer, societies are on the way to limiting democratic rights, limiting the welfare state and limiting other aspects of freedom. Women do not have the choice or the liberty to ask whether they are discriminated against as women or for other reasons – because women make up more or less half and half of workers, entrepreneurs, emigrants or disabled people. So women face multiple discrimination. And yes indeed, we in Europe have seen a backlash throughout the last years, especially in some Member States.

Look, women charge fewer wages, fewer pensions; we have difficulty joining the labour market; we are the caregivers of dependents; every day there are women killed by sexist violence, victims of sexual violence and trafficking in human beings; even women, many times, are afraid to return home alone, and before that we cannot remain impassive.

Women throughout the European Union continue to face discrimination, harassment, are denied equal access to participation in public and political life, and suffer sexual and gender-based violence and abuse in public places and at home. We are now seeing a backlash against women’s rights, a backlash that hurts us all. We need to be alert. The advances of the last few decades are fragile and should by no means be taken for granted. Ultra-conservative, anti-feminist and religious groups systematically call gender equality into question and use religion, tradition or culture to legitimise violations of women’s rights. This includes organised lobbying against abortion, reproductive health rights and sexual education reforms. These attacks provide a powerful illustration of the extent and the nature of the backlash against women’s rights and gender equality in Europe.  In this resolution we call on the European Union to put words into action. I call on the Union and the Member States to commit to the realisation of women’s human rights, accelerate the implementation of all women’s rights instruments, keep women’s rights on the highest level of the political agenda at all times and, finally, invest in women’s and girls’ rights and in women’s organisations. We also need to ensure that national and regional budgets include increased dedicated investment to secure women’s rights. Equally, women’s organisations and experts should be included in all regional and global discussions on all issues and in national delegations to the intergovernmental meetings.

Let me just react, because I know we are running late, to two speakers.  First to Ms Matera: I am not satisfied either. I expected better or bigger progress when I started in this position of the Commissioner responsible for gender equality. However, we have to be aware of the wider context we are in. Somebody called this era the ‘era of anxiety’. We see a lot of uncertainty and nervousness in our society, and in such an atmosphere, people tend more to come back to old traditions and things which have somehow proved to work over the time before. So this period is not very favourable for new concepts, for new trends which will be accepted by wider society. That’s why we spoke about the results, that there is very little progress, but I wanted to mention this as one of the reasons why we have such little progress. Just an illustration: recently we had one government which didn’t have any women in it, that was Hungary. Now, as Ms Blinkevičiūtė mentioned, it’s Lithuania where there is no woman in the government. The people in these countries, the women in these countries, do not seem to mind, reactions are quite weak, and I believe that the people in the Member States have to express what they think about this and how they feel about such inequality, about seeing that there is no woman in their government. So we have to trust the people, that they will express how they want to live. I was always against, for instance, a regulation that will order people how to combine their roles. That’s why I was happy about the work—life balance initiative, which opens up the choice, which gives the opportunity to combine roles at work and at home for working parents, for women and men.  And I think that this is the way Europe should continue, by offering choices, enhancing equality, not tolerating discrimination – this has to be very much emphasised – and continue the smart policy which will combine regulation where needed – but I don’t believe regulation here works too well – but campaigning, awareness—raising, funding, training and so on. The second comment from Mr Jurek: I know very well what I said about the Istanbul Convention. We respect the right of sovereign states to ratify or not to ratify the Istanbul Convention. I just want to repeat here that I will continue to explain some of the misunderstandings and misleading arguments which appear around the interpretation of the Istanbul Convention, because I think that it is important to understand what the Convention is and what it isn’t.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, every day thousands of women face their battle against the evil of the century, cancer. They do so while courageously continuing to look after their family, while trying to continue working despite everything. For them and for all, we strongly demand easier and cheaper access to diagnostic and preventive examinations and treatment.  The figures that Eurostat presents to us every year are alarming: one in three Europeans develops cancer during their lifetime. Some 600 000 European women die of cancer every year, of which more than 90 000 are breast cancers, in addition to cervical and cervical cancer, to name but a few.  We know that cancers are devastating for everyone, men, women and unfortunately also children, but it must be recognised that when they affect us women, they often affect us in our femininity, attacking our bodies and depriving us of those parts that physiologically make us feel like women, such as the breasts or the reproductive system, and which have enormous psychological repercussions that are often set aside or underestimated in comparison with the severity of the disease itself. Compared to the figures of those mortally affected by evil, fortunately many more are the women who manage to overcome it. More than 80 % of Europeans affected by breast cancer, for example, survive after treatment. And it is also these women that we must protect, them and their families. After the disease, in fact, their lives change radically, both because of invasive treatments, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy, and as a result of the surgical operations they are forced to undergo, with not only physical devastation – think a hysterectomy or a mastectomy – but also psychological.  We therefore call on the European Commission, together with the Member States, to implement health policies and planning, taking into account a much wider range of facets that lie behind this terrible evil.  There are three main points I would like to highlight. The first is the prevention, monitoring and access to treatment. There is no doubt that the high incidence of mortality from cancer is due to the fact that it is often intervened in an already evolved phase of the disease, rendering any possible cure in vain. We are aware that if a disease is diagnosed in time, the healing rate is much higher. Prevention is essential through constant and accessible monitoring, also from an economic point of view, with both generic and specific screenings. It is true that prevention is not always easy to implement, as follow-up visits are often onerous and waiting times are very long. We therefore call for work to be done on this issue in order to defend everyone's health.  The second aspect is linked to the specific nature of the care needed in the event of women's illness. We are talking about cancer diseases that affect purely female organs, such as the breast or uterus, which can affect the femininity of the same woman. Care must take into account that we intervene on organs and parts of the body that represent our femininity and should, as far as possible, also take into account aesthetic as well as functional aspects.  Lastly, but that is what I would like us to dwell on, is the psychological and welfare aspect. This is linked to the need to ensure adequate support and assistance for women. At a time when the woman's body is being attacked to combat the disease and, surgically, the most essential parts of our femininity or reproductive capacity, often irreversibly, are being permanently damaged, psychological assistance, even in the period following surgical treatment and treatment, is absolutely necessary and must become everyone's right. Leaving these women alone means making it much more difficult for them to carry on their role as mothers or wives, roles that certainly do not stop with the disease.  I will conclude by asking the Commission to commit itself to developing a uniform European strategy for all Member States, through cancer screening programmes, combined with increased investment in both research programmes and health infrastructure.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 3, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 1, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 373, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, there were three very comprehensive questions, so, if you will allow me, I will take a bit more than three minutes because I need to address all the very sensitive questions.  Let me begin by thanking this House and especially Ms Daniela Aiuto for raising this crucial issue of women’s cancer on behalf of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. When it comes to cancer, the statistics are startling. It is Europe’s second leading cause of death. In 2015, cancer cut short the lives of more than 580 000 women, and it is increasing in prominence; almost four million new cases are expected this year alone.  But this disease is not only about statistics. Cancer damages our families, communities and economies and our healthcare and cure systems, and so on. Since the first Europe Against Cancer programme in 1980, science, research and public policies have led to new initiatives, more effective prevention and promotion schemes and improved screening, treatment and care. I am proud of what we have achieved together to fight cancer.  Legislation on tobacco and on carcinogens, the European Code Against Cancer and the implementation of national cancer plans are a few examples of concrete achievements. I am now going to outline other examples as a reply to your specific questions. Question No 1, about preparing a strategy at EU level. Let me stress that the Commission and the Member States are already collaborating to strengthen national cancer plans and ensure that patients, including women, benefit from high quality programmes. This will encompass all aspects of the cancer management cycle from fighting against the main carcinogenic risk factors that cause cancer to early prevention and early detection of cancer, survivorship and rehabilitation, and concrete cancer types.  This is in line with the 2017 European Guide on Quality Improvement in Comprehensive Cancer Control, which includes recommendations on screening, integrated cancer care, quality improvement in aftercare at community level and survivorship and rehabilitation. At the same time the Joint Research Centre provides evidence-based European Guidelines for breast cancer, covering the entire pathway of care and the latest information indicators quantifying the cancer burden across Europe. These data are enabled by the European Cancer Information System, which allows the use of patterns of incidence, mortality and survival.  In addition, the Commission is supporting Member States’ efforts on vaccination, including against the hepatitis B virus and the human papillomavirus that causes liver and cervical cancer in women, and I ask you all to be very active in fighting against vaccine hesitancy because it is about prevention of cancer.  I should emphasise that since the adoption of a Council recommendation on cancer screening, we have seen a continuous improvement in national screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer. Twenty-five EU countries now have population-based programmes for breast cancer and 22 for cervical cancer. Of course it would be good to have all Member States together but it is much more than when we started with 18 and 17 countries 10 years ago.  Over the past decade the EU’s average proportion of women targeted for breast cancer increased from 54% to 58% – as always, prevention is a very difficult task, to motivate people to follow a prevention idea – and screening for cervical cancer rose from 54% to 60%. This has a concrete impact on breast and cervical survival rates and reflects both early detection and effectiveness of treatment. Second point, does the Commission plan to prepare standards for cancer screening programmes, and so on? I would like to recall that the European Commission Initiative on Breast Cancer provides the European Breast Guidelines, which cover the entire breast-cancer cycle from screening to end-of-life care, and they are tailored to the needs of the different users.  In addition, the European Guidelines for Quality Assurance in Cervical Cancer Screening have been updated also, but guidelines, recommendations and best practices need to be translated into practice through implementation of concrete solutions in Member States and we are doing a lot to encourage Member States to really provide on the ground those programmes in regard to implementation.  This will drive change and improvement on the ground. In this context a new Steering Group on Health Promotion, Disease Prevention and Management of Non-Communicable Diseases bridges those gaps between knowledge and funding in a practical way, advising Member States with concrete examples of what they can do, because we have only one tool, once again to cooperate. It advises the Commission about evidence-based best practices in Member States that can be transferred, scaled up and implemented more broadly with support from the EU health programme and as an EU financial instrument. The new framework programme for research, Horizon Europe, is introducing the concept of mission driving initiatives in research – it just proposed it – and cancer in, for example, children, girls, and so on could be considered. The third question is: will the Commission and Member States plan a cancer-prevention awareness campaign? A very good question! A timely question! Let me assure you that prevention is the cornerstone of our efforts. We know very well that prevention is better than cure, but how can we disseminate that message to the public? The Commission continues to work with the Member States and the World Health Organisation, including the International Agency for Research on Cancer, and with non-governmental organisations in order regularly to update, and to promote implementation of, the European Code Against Cancer. This Code is a very powerful tool: simple, understandable and powerful. The Code contains 12 messages to reduce the risk of cancer, highlighting areas like tobacco use, exercise, diet, alcohol intake, nutritional issues, and so on, in a very simple way but using very strong messages. In addition, the Code recommends taking part in organised cancer screening programmes, including for breast and cervical cancers, and urges people to vaccinate children against hepatitis B and the human papillomavirus. Such initiatives providing information in a citizen-friendly, easily understandable way are essential to get the message across on how cancer risk can be reduced.  But I encourage Member States to do more in the spirit of cooperation, such as organising cancer awareness campaigns about available screening programmes and in public spaces. I saw an excellent example when I used to take the plane from Brussels to Poland a lot: I saw a stewardess who informed women on the plane, telling them about the possibilities for using breast-cancer screening. It was an excellent example of cooperation. Let’s do more. And, of course, in the context of the European elections, this topic should be kept very high on the political agenda and in public debate.

In Europe, one million and 300,000 people die of cancer every year, more than a quarter of the deaths. On the other hand, for some cancers, such as breast cancer, the probability of survival is 80 percent, but with a key condition of early detection. We need to put in place a better system of controls and screening for all cancers, and better and more affordable healthcare for all patients. Every woman should have universal and equal access to health services, in particular early cancer screenings, treatment and free and high-quality post-treatment support, regardless of place of residence, social status, occupation, culture or any other factor. Women who survive cancer may encounter particular difficulties when returning to work, education or family life. Preserving reproductive health during therapies is particularly problematic. Cancer diseases are very worrying and much more can be done to save lives by pooling resources, knowledge and existing technologies. In my amendments, I stressed that research into all types of cancer must be invested. Also, there is a need to react to worrying differences in cancer deaths between Central and Eastern Europe compared to the European average. I call on the Commission to act, in particular as regards the prevalence and mortality of ovarian cancer and cervical cancer. It is also necessary to promote a healthier lifestyle. Patients need to be provided with quality care, but also support for their family. Member States should set up quality treatment centres that can be funded by the Structural and Cohesion Funds.

There are about thirty thousand new cases of cancer in Slovakia every year. Despite the fact that it is one of the diseases that kills the most, we do not currently know the exact number of positively diagnosed in Slovakia. For several years now, there has been no functioning national cancer register. However, this situation should come to an end this year and data collection should finally be resumed. Likewise, after years of efforts by many doctors and patient representatives, screening for cervical cancer, colorectal cancer and breast cancer is finally being launched these days. It is the latter type of cancer that is the most common malignant tumor in women in Slovakia. Unfortunately, many women are already diagnosed with an advanced form of cancer, so on average 300 women a year die completely unnecessarily in our country. I therefore very much welcome the introduction of screening, which will also recommend screened mammograms to invited women. It is extremely important that examinations are done competently and also that the myth of the harmfulness of mammograms is refuted. Because mammography is really the only method at the moment that can also capture the early stage of breast cancer. A screening examination takes several minutes in a woman's life, but it can save a life.

Thank you, Madam President. Commissioner Andriukaitis, ladies and gentlemen, there are many challenges in our policy to improve the life of a woman with cancer. For me, this starts with prevention at European level. The first challenge we need to tackle is harmonising the quality of screening across Europe. Earlier screening in at-risk groups can already drastically reduce the number of patients. The quality of life is strongly affected by any type of cancer. For example, women have to fight against depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, loss of appetite and lack of zest for life. In addition, the side effects of cancer therapy can lead to an early menopause, which means that for young women becoming a mother becomes almost impossible. That is why I support the \"Transforming Breast Cancer Together\" initiative. With this initiative, we will be working with stakeholders across party borders and borders to discuss how to improve the lives of women with breast cancer. Cancer also has a negative effect on a woman's professional career, with the result that she may be absent for a long time and may even lose her job. Even after healing, patients still suffer consequences. That is why I am a strong supporter of the 'right to be forgotten' initiative. After healing, it should be possible to take out insurance or to enter into financial transactions such as loans as if one had never been ill. Thanks to research and innovation, there has already been a lot of progress in cancer prevention, treatment and care for cancer patients.

As we read in the press, as the ombudsman says, as the last report of the European Observatory says, it is impossible to disguise the infinite number of meetings between lobbies and the Commission. Or the countless events, within this House, sponsored by companies also in the healthcare sector. This collusion is observed, for example, in the case of defective breast implants manufactured by a French company, which has been the subject of constant public denunciation in recent years. Despite this scandal, other manufacturers still do not adequately warn of the risks and adverse effects of silicone gel. That is why in the coming weeks we will return, again, to discuss this issue in the Committee on Petitions. The same is true of cancer treatments, which need a strong, undeniably universal and public health system, and with as many means as possible and appropriate to gender specificities. We must ensure that the Commission promotes the exchange of good practices in the prevention, detention, treatment and monitoring of the cure of diseases, as in the case of breast cancer. Second, States implementing public health measures should raise a holistic view, not only with adequate funding of their health systems to make them accessible and quality, but also in the framework of monitoring high-risk health products, assessing their effect on women's health.

Let me react a little bit. Some people raised issues about medical devices, prosthesis and so on. Now we have a new Medical Devices Directive; now we are carrying out a health technology assessment because it’s about innovation in cancer treatment. Let’s go forward. It is in our hands to regulate the environment, speaking about multinationals and so on, and it’s about transparency. Let’s take carcinogens. We included a lot of new carcinogens on the list when we talked about safety at work. Acrylamides, endocrine disruptors, the fight against tobacco, a tracking and tracing system, the possibilities of strictly regulating pesticides. We did a lot in those four and a half years together and thank you. We are cooperating in cancer prevention. That is the comprehensive answer, of course. Sitting on top of cancer requires investment in research and innovation. Through each framework programme for research, the EU has invested some EUR 2.8 billion since 2007 on prevention. Altogether this is OK – we are moving forward. Some EUR 440 million have been devoted in the last ten years to cancer that specifically affects women, mainly targeting breast cancer and cancers of the reproductive organs. Secondly, access to data also empowers patients. In this light, I would like to inform you about the adoption last week of the recommendation of the creation of a secure system that really enables citizens to access their electronic health files across Member States and can help us to support those who are suffering from cancer. Finally, I would like to underline that cancer treatment is no longer just about survival. We therefore need to ensure that the reintegration into education, employment and daily life for women having suffered from cancer is as easy as possible. It is the responsibility of employers and trade unions, and it would also be good to raise questions about cancer at the Council of the Heads of State or Government.

According to the available data, we can see that the percentage of women's survival can reach almost 80% after early diagnosis and timely treatment. This shows how important quality prophylactic screening of the whole population for cancer is. However, even if women manage to overcome cancer, the fight does not end, as they often have serious and usually underestimated psychological problems, especially if they have undergone a hysterectomy or mastectomy. Women and their family members should receive special counseling assistance. In addition, it is essential that women can easily participate in screening programmes, receive affordable and equal treatment and access to affordable and equal support, and provide them with tailor-made support and information on lifestyle-related factors that can help prevent cancer.

Every year, more than four thousand women develop breast cancer in Finland. Different approaches and targeted policies are needed to diagnose and prevent cancer diseases in men and women. In Finland, a great example is breast cancer screening. People aged 50 to 69 receive an invitation to screening every couple of years. This is aimed at detecting breast cancer at an early stage, when treatment is more effective. In Finland, the breast cancer prognosis is good: 89% of sufferers are alive after five years of diagnosing the disease.

I know that many people today in the Chamber care about this issue, and I particularly thank Parliament’s LGBTI Intergroup for ensuring that this has been brought to the agenda. In particular, I want to raise one aspect of the fight against discrimination against LGBTI people, and that is to highlight the fact that this is the first time a specific aspect of this issue is being debated in this Parliament – having been debated in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and, indeed, in the UN. This will be the first time that the daily discrimination faced by intersex people – the ‘I’ in LGBTI – has been discussed here in the European Parliament. And that is significant and important. So, to focus on the oral question and resolution put forward by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, which touches upon this issue not often discussed but extremely important. Why important? If we are going to measure our values in the European Union by the way particular communities are treated and their vulnerability, then clearly the position faced by intersex people, not only in the European Union but also worldwide, is of significance. And it’s worth mentioning that human rights violations experienced by this community are significant, and we need to put them on the agenda today. Intersex people face violation of their bodily integrity. Very often intersex is still considered as a disease, as something wrong, to be fixed, and ‘normalising’ surgery is often applied. Medical treatments are carried out on intersex newborns in at least 21 EU Member States. Secondly, throughout their lives, intersex people are victims of stigma, verbal discrimination including in the workplace, harassment, and lack of adequate medical care, legal recognition and access to justice, and of the invisibility of their bodies in our society. However, there is still no legal protection against discrimination based on such sex characteristics: no legal recognition of intersex people. So today, we call on the Council and the Commission to ensure a de-pathologisation of intersex people and to prohibit unnecessary sex-normalising treatment and surgery. We know that in some Member States there has been progress, but in too many Member States there is insufficient progress. We ask for gender and sex characteristics to be recognised as a ground of discrimination. We ask for provision of adequate, impartial psychosocial counselling; for the mainstreaming of flexible birth registration; and for legal gender-recognition procedures to be facilitated. The key questions we’re asking of the Commission are very important ones. Today, almost 10 years on – and while I know the Commissioner is strongly committed to this, as she said in the LIBE Committee – we still do not have our cross-cutting anti-discrimination directive. So the base, which I know the Commissioner and the Members here are committed to, has not been put in place. And really the question is: what can we do to advance this anti-discrimination directive in a wider way? Secondly, specifically with the intersex community, what are we doing to ensure that sex characteristics as a ground of discrimination, hate crime and hate speech are recognised? Today, in the EU, only Malta and Portugal have outlawed medically unnecessary treatments on intersex children, and only Malta, Portugal and Greece have explicitly recognised sex characteristics as a ground of discrimination, hate crime and hate speech. It is intolerable that people in Europe continue to be discriminated against because of who they love, the body they are born with, and their personal sense of their gender. It is important today that we have put this on the agenda. And, I repeat, if we are to have values across the EU that we can respect, then they must entail caring for the most vulnerable minorities in our society; facing up to such discrimination; and showing that we are not afraid to stand up against it. For that reason, I am very proud that this oral question and resolution are being presented to you today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 396, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  author. – Madam President, in ‘LGBTI’, what does the ‘I’ stand for?

I want to agree with you, Mr Moraes, that the anti—discrimination directive, on which I am the shadow rapporteur for the PPE Group, should move forward. It’s unacceptable that it has been blocked for years in the Council. Too often, LGBTI people are victims of bullying, hate speech, homophobia, stereotypes and stigmatisation, at school and online.

The families of LGBTQ people are not recognised – no free movement here, indeed. Transgender and intersex people are subjected to abusive and even genital mutilation. LGBTQ refugees are locked up and deported – in 2019 in Europe. In some countries, fighting and solidarity between different groups have progressed, but in other countries things are going in the wrong direction. Nationalists and conservatives are attacking our rights. They organize themselves and say we're unnatural. We're freaks, we're unwanted. It's over. It is time to fight back and we intend to do so together with other movements that want to see a better Europe and a more humane and equal future – queer solidarity, my friends – refugee solidarity movements, women's movements, functional rights movements and many others who want to see a humane and equal future. We demand political action. Imagine that ministers could not even agree on a few small lines on LGBTQ rights, because then Orbán and Poland and others said no. Here we colleagues have managed to agree on a strategy for the rights of intersex people. We're advancing the positions. We also call for a comprehensive strategy for LGBTQ rights against discrimination, a new discrimination law. We need to put an end to hate crimes and threats against LGBTQ people. We need to support all LGBTQ kids around Europe. We need to stand up for the rainbow families. We're not going to go away. I myself thought I would come back here as an MEP after the elections in May and then it will be a political workshop, may you believe. Then we're going to move the positions forward.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, allow me to say an initial word about the fact that these two questions, which are likely to close the work of this parliamentary term, are also the completion of work done with the many colleagues within the European Parliament's LGBTI intergroup, and so this fills me with pride.  Through this resolution, Mr President, the European Parliament intends to call on the Commission to ensure that the rights of LGBTI people are a top priority in the work programme from 2019 to 2024. It is crucial to ensure a comprehensive and strong follow-up strategy on the list of actions to further improve the protection of the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex people, and to promote equality. To date, the rights of LGBTI people are not protected uniformly across Europe. Unfortunately, the European Union does not yet have global protection against discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation or sexual characteristics. Same-sex unions are not yet recognised in all Member States, sterilisation is a requirement for legal recognition of this kind in eight Member States, and 18 Member States require a mental health diagnosis. In 21 Member States, intersex children undergo 'sexual normalisation' interventions.  In the meantime, the list of actions remains limited in terms of priorities and commitment, and the European Union's innovative responses, such as the pillar of social rights, are not being integrated. Only by restoring credibility to this policy document, by protecting the rights of intersex people, by protecting European citizens from all forms of discrimination through the horizontal anti-discrimination directive, which has been blocked for ten years now, as has already been said, and by taking concrete measures to guarantee the freedom of movement of families, including LGBTI families, will we respond in accordance with the demands of the Court of Justice.

First of all, like my colleagues, I’m pleased and proud that we have our very first resolution on intersex people on the agenda. I think that is a strong political signal. At the same time, we’re also looking at the resolution on the LGBTI list of actions that was adopted by the Commission at the start of its term of office. In my view, these two resolutions should be a kind of legacy to the next European Parliament, and also to the next Commission, and a call for stronger action – even stronger action than has been taken in the past five years – because I think that a lot still needs to be done. A lot has been achieved, but if I look at the Council, for example, I note that at one of the last Council meetings the Member States couldn’t even agree on a joint statement on LGBTI rights. Hello! We’re still in the Middle Ages. Some countries are blocking it. I also note, like other colleagues, that the anti-discrimination directive has been blocked for more than 10 years now. But I note, too, if I look at our own House, that the President of our House, Mr Tajani, is one of the keynote speakers at the World Congress of Families, which is probably one of the most homophobic, anti-choice events that you will find in the world. One of the co—organisers is an organisation called CitizenGO, which is also one of the champions of the so-called Nashville Declaration, which is the most homophobic declaration in the world. It has also been signed by some people in this House. I do not feel represented by Mr Tajani showing up at such an event and then arguing here for LGBTI rights.

This message is long overdue, but it comes at a very crucial moment because the rights of all LGBTI people are currently under attack. After decades of progress, we are in danger of going backwards. To prevent that from happening, the EU must adopt a strategy on how to prevent it. A new list of measures on LGBTI rights is the least that the Commission can do in order to stand firm with those who are fighting to love and to live as they want to. The specific measures that we want the Commission to take are: to unblock the cross-cutting equality directive proposal in the Council; to make LGBTI rights a priority, including in the forthcoming work programme; to follow up on the Coleman case to enable freedom of movement for LGBTI citizens of the European Union; and to ensure that all possible measures are taken to fight discrimination against LGBTI people throughout the European Union.

I will focus particularly on the rights of intersex people, which should be protected in all Member States and which are the subject of one of your questions to the Council. I would like to begin by stating very clearly that violence and discrimination have no place in European society. We should not forget that Romania’s Presidency of the Council of the European Union has as one of its priorities combating discrimination of any kind. The principles and values enshrined in the EU Treaties, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and EU legislation are not up for negotiation or bargaining. In Europe, the commitment to decency, tolerance and equal treatment is the very foundation of the idea of a just society. This is a source of pride for Europeans, and for good reason: our society is becoming more inclusive and diverse than ever before. Together, we have taken steps to guarantee equal treatment for women, ethnic minorities, sexual minorities, persons with disabilities, religious minorities and citizens of all ages. And we continue to work on that. I believe that all three EU institutions fundamentally agree on the direction of the journey – towards even greater emancipation and tolerance. I am proud to say that the Council has already adopted legislation that clearly prohibits discrimination on the grounds listed in Article 19 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, but, as you well know, the anti-discrimination law book remains incomplete. We have better protection, at EU level in respect of discrimination on some grounds rather than others. As many of you have often reminded us, the Council has not yet exhausted its legal capabilities in that regard. I would like now to turn to the specific issue of violence and discrimination against intersex people. For, indeed, you speak of real suffering in the questions you have put to the Council and the Commission today. I am proud to point out that, in June 2016, the Council responded positively to the Commission’s list of actions to advance LGBTI equality. It was the first time that the Council had adopted a declaration devoted to the advancement of equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons. So it was a historic moment. In its conclusions the Council invited the Commission to promote the measures outlined in this list of actions and to report on a regular basis on the progress achieved. The Council also invited the Member States to take their own actions to combat discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender identity. It is, of course, the responsibility of the Member States to hear that call.  Honourable Members, the advancement of equal treatment is a joint effort to which we all must contribute. When it comes to cooperation at EU level, the Commission’s list of actions, including the exchange of good practice, is to be welcomed. The Commission has also undertaken a campaign of awareness raising. The Fundamental Rights Agency is also making important contributions by mapping out the situation of intersex people, including the problems they face in terms of birth registration as well as the matter of non-necessary surgery – which you mentioned – and the closely related problem of informed consent. This is, first and foremost, a question of medical ethics, for which the Member States are responsible and accountable. The issue of birth registration is also a national matter. Indeed, when it comes to the more specific issues identified in your question, it is the Member States that have the key competences. However, this does not mean there is no European dimension or solution. Of course there is. As you know, the category of intersex is not included on the list of prohibited discrimination grounds in the Treaties, but I believe it is obvious that extending the right to equal treatment for intersex people is entirely within the spirit of our common European values and our common campaign for inclusiveness. As we pursue, improve and defend our values, we all benefit from constructive exchanges, including the one we are holding here today and the vote you will have tomorrow. Thank you for your attention. I would like to remind you, as I said at the beginning, that the Romanian Presidency of the Council has as one of its priorities the fight against discrimination, and this is one of the opportunities that we are proud to have.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 402, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me first start by thanking Parliament for tabling this debate on the discrimination against LGBTI people. The Commission is committed to the advancement of equality of LGBTI people and welcomes that Parliament has ensured, through the report, that these issues, and particularly the situation of intersex persons, are kept high on the political radar screen.  It is exactly for this reason that we published a list of actions to advance LGBTI equality, in December 2015. In the coming months we will present a third report on the implementation of the list of actions. I will come back to this list of actions at the end of this opening remark.  Let me say a few words on the problems related to intersex people who, as we all know and as you mentioned many times, are having serious problems because they do not fit into the main gender categories – female and male. The unnecessary surgical operations and treatments that intersex children may undergo are especially worrying since they are not able to give their fully informed consent due to their young age.  However, according to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the definition of health policies and the organisation and delivery of health services, fall under the responsibility of Member States. The Commission respects the principle of subsidiarity in the area of ethical accountability for the surgical treatment that intersex young people and children undergo. The possibility to provide a third gender option at birth or in public documents are also competences of the Member States.  Regarding transgender people, Member States have to ensure that the relevant laws are applied in accordance with the latest international human rights standards. The European Court of Human Rights ruled that the condition of compulsory sterilising surgery or treatment for legal gender recognition violated Article 8 of the Convention.  So I will now come back to our list of actions which aim to advance LGBTI rights. Within the framework, or based on this list of actions, the Commission has carried out several activities to raise awareness of the difficulties that transgender and intersex people experience. It recently published a new report on trans and intersex equality rights in Europe.  We also financially support civil society organisations whose work also includes promoting transgender and intersex equality. We have released awareness raising videos and we organised a good practice exchange between the Member States on these topics.  Upon the request of Parliament, the pilot project Health4LGBTI was carried out, which also focused on the specific health issues transgender and intersex people face.  As part of the list of actions, the Commission also monitors and enforces existing rights of LGBTI people under the Free Movement Directive. The Commission welcomes the recent ruling by the Court in the Coman case and the Commission will monitor Member States’ compliance with the EU free movement acquis as regards issues related to sexual orientation.  The Commission will continue to implement the list of actions to advance LGBTI rights in 2019. This year a new Eurobarometer on discrimination, including relevant questions for LGBTI equality, and the second Fundamental Rights Agency LGBTI survey will take place. These surveys will provide us with important data that will help us to target our future actions. This year is the year of evaluation and preparatory works for the future, updated LGBTI list of actions which should be adopted by the newly established Commission and endorsed by Parliament.  The Commission is committed to successfully and positively handing over its work to advance LGBTI equality to the next Commission, which will have to decide how it will continue these policies. But I will strongly recommend that my successor involve the European Parliament and civil society organisations in the design of its future LGBTI list of actions, as also suggested in the motion we are debating today.  I want also to react to the debate we have heard up to now. The Commission continues to promote the adoption of the horizontal equal treatment directive. As you rightly pointed out, I will call it a shameful situation that it has been blocked for years in the Council. You are aware that this piece of legislation requires unanimous adoption. That’s why we need to have all the Member States on board.  When I indicated that after so many years of having this blocked, the Treaty offers the option of enhanced cooperation, you will not be surprised that the Member States – at least in the reactions I got in the Council meetings, but also in many bilateral meetings where I raised this issue – confirmed that they need more time and they do not want us to go for the enhanced cooperation, because this is about fundamental rights. So I just convey this information to you and I will continue to keep pushing because we regularly discuss the prospects of this directive, which I would like to see in a positive way. My last comment: you also raised the issue of hate speech online and hate speech in general. The Commission is continuing very intensive work, together with the IT sector, to achieve a radical decrease in hate speech online and a decrease in hate speech from the social networks. We are reasonably successful. The IT sector is doing what it committed itself to do in the Code of Conduct and we will continue to do this exercise in the future until the end of my mandate.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, even now LGBTI rights are not guaranteed in the EU. There are major differences between EU Member States. There is still no comprehensive protection against discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation or gender characteristics. Many EU countries do not recognise marriages between two men or two women, which is possible in Belgium. Prior sterilisation is still a prerequisite for legal change of gender in eight Member States, while 18 Member States require psychological research. In 21 Member States, \"gender normalisation surgery\" is performed on intersex children. The question is whether this is in line with the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. I support the Commission's call to ensure that LGBTI rights are a priority in its 2019-2024 work programme, among other things, and to strengthen cooperation between the various DGs, with the aim of better mainstreaming LGBTI rights, such as in education and health.

Tonight we present the European Parliament resolution and the oral question on the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes. We discussed this topic a lot at the ENVI Committee, and when drafting this resolution we wanted to focus on supporting quality research into cannabis-based drugs, as well as on distinguishing between cannabis-based drugs that have undergone clinical trials and have been regulatorily approved, and medical cannabis itself. This term is largely undefined from a legal point of view and therefore I consider that it remains unclear and open to interpretation. In addition, an important aspect of this resolution was to make a strict distinction between the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes and its misuse.  European Union countries vary widely in their approach to cannabis regulations, including cannabis legislation for medicinal purposes, for example, on the maximum levels of permissible concentrations of THC and CBD. Even in those Member States where medical cannabis is legal, the conditions for access, prescribing, purchasing, pricing, reimbursement, as well as the level of knowledge of healthcare professionals about the use of such medicines vary greatly and are a problem for patients. That is why, in our oral question, we asked the Commission for justification: what the Commission has undertaken to support quality research, what it plans to do about future research, how much funding it plans to allocate to research in this area under the Ninth Horizon Europe Framework Programme, and whether the Commission considers that the regulatory environment in the European Union supports quality research on medical cannabis. Likewise, does the Commission consider that it should improve patients' access to medical cannabis? Also, does the Commission intend to establish standards for non-pharmacoceutic medical cannabis to ensure user safety?  In the resolution, we called on the Commission and national authorities to work together to ensure a legal definition of medical cannabis and to make a clear distinction between cannabis-based medicines approved by the European Medical Agency or other regulatory agencies, medical cannabis not supported by clinical trials and cannabis for other applications.  As we know, the cannabis plant is made up of a number of cannabionides that can have a neuroprotective effect, can contribute to reducing some symptoms in patients such as inflammation or bacterial infections, and can also promote bone growth. Also, a comprehensive, evidence-based regulation of cannabis-based medicines would entail additional resources for public authorities, limit the black market, ensure product quality and accurate labelling to help control selling points, limit access to the substance for minors, but also provide legal certainty and safe access to patients who would use it for medicinal purposes with specific precautions for young people and pregnant women.  It is important to point out that the review of existing scientific literature on cannabis use gives conclusive and satisfactory evidence that it has therapeutic effects in the treatment of chronic pain in adults, for example in the case of cancer, which we talked about at the last point, as well as in the case of epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, arthritis, asthma, Chron disease, glaucoma, as well as symptoms of spasticity described by patients with multiple sclerosis and are effective in treating patients with anxiety disorder , PTSD and depression.  I would not want to go too far with this theme, so here I will conclude that the work of european institutions and agencies to raise awareness of the importance of research and the legal definition of this medical cannabis is of the utmost importance and can only help patients who really need these drugs, of course, with strict regulations and thorough analysis.  It is up to us politicians, public figures, professors, activists to unite in the fight to improve health in every way. In any case, I would just like to emphasize that we want to strictly part the use of cannabis for medicinal purposes from the one used for recreational purposes and it is very important to emphasize this so that any abuse with this desire of ours is addressed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 415, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, over the past decade, we have seen growing public interest in the development of therapies derived from cannabis and its components and in the use of cannabis for medical purposes. The therapeutic use of cannabis has been discussed in relation to a wide range of medical conditions, from multiple sclerosis to post—traumatic stress disorder and anxiety. I would first like to highlight the distinction between non—pharmaceutical medical cannabis and medicinal products derived from cannabis. When it comes to the regulatory point of view, the EU angle is limited. This is a Member State competence, which means that each national authority will decide whether it is legal in its territory. On the other hand, the EU pharmaceutical legislative framework is clear and robust and includes cannabis—derived medicinal products. A marketing authorisation is granted for a medicinal product only after its quality, safety and efficacy have been evaluated, and a positive benefit/risk balance related to its use has been concluded. Once placed on the market, medicinal products continue to be monitored through pharmacovigilance activities, which also apply to cannabis—derived medicinal products. So, how exactly can the EU contribute to this discussion? Well, early dialogue and scientific advice for medicinal-product development are examples of EU added value. Furthermore, coordination between the various EU agencies is crucial. Let me now address each of the questions you raised. As a starting point, let me stress that more research is needed on the safety and efficacy of cannabinoid—based therapies. Opportunities to support this type of research will be available through the upcoming Horizon 2020 calls for research proposals in 2019 and 2020. As for previous framework programmes for research and innovation, the EU has funded a number of relevant projects and fellowships. More than EUR 40 million has been dedicated to research on cannabis and cannabinoid—based compounds. Our mission is to encourage research and innovation in Europe and we will continue with that approach. In the new framework programme, Horizon Europe, the Commission will continue to support research, including in innovative areas including novel therapeutic approaches. Turning now to your second series of questions, let me say that the healthcare—related issues are complex, and decisions are taken by the Member States. The EU regulatory framework for pharmaceuticals provides for the authorisation of medicinal products derived from cannabis when their quality, safety and efficacy have been proven. Any other use of cannabis for a medical purpose falls within the competence of the Member States. However, that is not to say that the EU is not contributing to this discussion. In October 2016, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction launched a new service on cannabis, providing updates on cannabis policy models. In December 2018, the agency published a report on medical use of cannabis and cannabinoids, as well as questions and answers for policy making. This was in response to the growing interest in the topic. On your third set of questions, I want to take this opportunity to stress that non—pharmaceutical medical cannabis lies outside EU competence. At the same time, the Commission is aware of the discussion in the World Health Organisation Expert Committee on Drug Dependence about the pharmaceutical preparation of psychoactive substances. If applicable, the relevant conclusions will be considered in the framework of the pharmaceutical legislation on a product basis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 416, "date": "2019-02-12.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which The medical use of cannabis makes sense. Cannabis products can help patients who are not or do not help well enough from other drugs. We must beware of two extremes in the debate. One extreme, as with Pavlov's dog, is to hear the word cannabis and react: Oh, this is something dangerous, horrible, illegal drugs, we have to be against it. If used medically in a controlled manner, this Pavlovian reflex is not appropriate.  But on the other hand, we also have to be careful that patients do not develop an attitude, as I was once told as a doctor by a patient who said: Yes, against my back pain only helps if I smoke in a joint. Without it, this had really been examined well beforehand by a specialist, who might have given him quite different tips on what to do against back pain. So, you have to do it within a regulated framework. You have to be careful. I also expressly agree with paragraph 14 in the resolution that, as with other medicines, this must be done under the rules of authorisation. Surely we cannot impose high burdens on the industry on other matters and say that if they use cannabis, we can simply do it somewhere.

But in this regard, a number of amendments have been tabled, including by Conservative MPs, which say that only the form of drugs could be useful. However, this is not entirely true because, as we know, mild prescribing methods, for example, herbal teas, ointments or others can sometimes be much more effective and much more targeted in some patients who do not tolerate drugs. So be careful. Of course, we need medicines and they need to be controlled, but we must also trust doctors to prescribe other methods of administration, and that is in particular the meaning of the amendments that my group will table, which are more appropriate methods for certain pathologies and profiles.

It is obvious that cannabis is not a panacea, but it does have therapeutic properties for the symptomatic treatment of some diseases.

We must not, on the other hand, trivialize the risks of cannabis use. According to the WHO Committee of Experts on Pharmacodependence, its consumption can cause adverse effects such as dizziness and motor disturbances and cognitive function. It is necessary to carry out a greater number of pharmacological, preclynic, toxicological and trial research, which ensures the control of the quality, safety and efficacy of the medical use of cannabis and its cannabinoids, as well as studies that allow to know the possible risks associated with its consumption.

The two main substances contained in dried or fermented female cannabis inflorescences (Cannabis sativa) are THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinoid), which has a 'narcotic' effect: it makes it euphoric, gives a feeling of \"full backlash\", changes sensations, while CBD (cannabidiol) has anti convulsive, antipsychotic, anti-inflammatory, anticancer effects, and probably also prevents neurodegenerative changes.

The modification of the human genome does not only concern a narrow group that wants to determine the direction of scientific and research progress, it concerns all of us. Somatic cell genetic editing technology is an asset with revolutionary potential to advance the treatment of individual patients' diseases. However, it is necessary to distinguish it carefully from the genetic editing of embryos and gametes, which carries the risk of serious side effects, not only for the individual, but also for his offspring. Hereditary genetic changes would thus lead to changes in all future generations. The irresponsible and unethical experiment by Chinese scientist Che Yiandej, who created the world's first genetically engineered children using genetic editing technology, requires a serious international response. This answer cannot be an easy call for the introduction of safety and efficiency standards for such 'inherited children'. The problem is not only how it was done, but above all what has been done. Germline genetic adjustment is internationally prohibited precisely because of its contradiction with the value of human dignity, human rights, integrity, but also equality. The consequences of reproductive genetic engineering give rise to serious societal and ethical risks. The scientific community cannot have the exclusive competence to decide such a serious matter with far-reaching consequences. Public confidence in new technologies is part of human progress. There is a need for a community-wide debate based on a correct interpretation of scientific knowledge in a social context.

I am well aware of the recent unfortunate event that is referred to in the question and which has triggered widespread awareness of the consequences emanating from the possibility to adjust the human genome. The honourable Members refer to clinical trials where genome editing is used in treatments affecting an individual who is suffering from a serious medical condition.  Based on that reference, I understand that we agree that increased knowledge about the human genome, and in particular about genetic causes of illness, could contribute to alleviating human suffering by opening the way to new therapies against such diseases. On the other hand, I am strongly convinced that we are all very concerned about the risk associated with manipulating the genome of future generations. In this context, I allow myself to recall that the debate on the ethical consequences of knowledge about and the possibilities to manipulate the human genome has been ongoing for some decades now. Politicians and scientists are well aware of the situation. This has resulted in legislative and other initiatives to strictly regulate manipulation of the human genome and in particular to prevent human germline genome modification. I would like to point to the legislative framework at Union level, in particular the legislative acts concerning pharmaceuticals and medical devices. We set strict rules for interaction with the human genome for somatic purposes and prohibit germline modification. This said, I would like also to draw everyone’s attention to the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, the first principle of which is human dignity, and which clearly prohibits eugenic practices in the fields of medicine and biology. To the best of my understanding the act of germline genome editing to which the honourable Members refer would therefore be illegal in the Union. I read your questions as dealing with future directions in this field. It must be noted that the Treaties, and in particular Article 168(7) of the Founding Treaty of the European Union, give Member States, and not the Union, the competence for medical care, including the corresponding ethical considerations. The use of gene editing as a means of medical care should be regulated at Member State level. I am convinced that the Commission, which has the sole right of initiative concerning Union legislation, is following this issue and will, if it deems it necessary or appropriate, prepare legislative proposals. The Romanian Presidency, and I believe the incoming Presidencies, are ready to give our full priority to the examination of any such proposals and I thank you for your attention.

The latter has been looking into the ethical and legal debate on germline genome editing. We are also involved with the World Health Organisation in considering the governance and oversight of human gene editing. At the level of the European Union, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation and the EU clinical trials and legislation for medicinal products contain specific requirements prohibiting these types of research activity. In addition, the EU has a robust regulatory framework on medicinal products, which is underpinned by the principles of the Council of Europe’s Oviedo Convention on protecting human rights in the biomedical field. Regulation 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products provides for strict controls in respect of quality, safety and efficacy and for a centralised authorisation system.

But there must be ethically motivated boundaries that we respect. Not everything that is technically feasible can be carried out. Researcher He Jiankui's experiments, presented at the Hong Kong conference in November, are irresponsible – and not just in the case of individual cases. Interventions in the human germline are generally irresponsible.  I am very grateful that there has also been a great outcry in the scientific community. But this outcry must now be sustained.
