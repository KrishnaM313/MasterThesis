We do understand very well that the CAP does of course need to be prolonged and that we need to assure certainty for farmers. However, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI) has decided that they are prolonging it, instead of for one year, for two years. That makes this a decision about a value in money of EUR 100 billion. That decision has been taken in the AGRI Committee. We as Greens think that deserves a plenary discussion, so that’s what we’re voting on. We’re not voting against the extension. We are voting against the mandate for direct negotiations. We want to negotiate the mandate here in this plenary because a decision on EUR 100 billion should be a debate here in plenary. That’s what we’re voting on and that’s why we are asking all our colleagues to vote against the mandate so that we can have a plenary debate on this issue. That will take place in June, well in time before the decisions will be taken, and I hope on the understanding of my colleagues that they will support this objection so we can vote for a full plenary mandate. The rapporteur said in an email that we need a strong and clear mandate. Well, I can assure you that the strongest mandate you can get is by a plenary mandate. Let’s ensure a plenary mandate in June and, for that, we need to vote against a direct mandate for only the AGRI Committee.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2020-05-15.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  Thank you, Mr Eickhout, for the explanations.
