The European Semester has become a key mechanism for the coordination of economic policies at EU level. It has played a crucial role in triggering and supporting urgently needed economic reforms in Member States, and in the current context of a gradual but all-too-moderate recovery, there is no time for complacency. The messages included in the 2017 Annual Growth Survey, and more generally in the Autumn Package, are a reflection of the new impetus that the Commission has given to economic governance, building on the experience of the last few years. The aim is to identify where challenges remain and where the EU and Member States should focus their efforts. In particular, faster progress on the implementation of structural reforms, in line with the country-specific recommendations, is needed to boost jobs and growth and to foster economic, social and territorial cohesion. As we have seen from the Commission’s autumn economic forecast, economic growth in Europe is expected to continue at a moderate pace. Recently, we have seen some labour market gains and rising private consumption but, at the same time, there are a number of risks to growth and a weakening of supportive factors like low oil prices. However, the economic recovery is proving quite resilient. The EU’s GDP is now higher than before the crisis. All Member States are set to grow next year. Investment is starting to increase, supported in part by projects financed under the Investment Plan for Europe. Labour market developments are also more encouraging. Employment is expected to grow faster this year than at any time since 2008, though unemployment still remains high.  Public finances continue to improve. In the EU, both average public deficit and the government debt-to-GDP ratio will continue to fall over the next two years. However, political uncertainty, slow global growth and weak global trade weigh on our growth prospects and we face a number of economic and social challenges. Unemployment is still high. Disparities persist across and within countries, both as regards economic performance and in terms of social challenges. Public and private debt levels remain high in some Member States and act as a drag on growth. In the financial sector there are still high levels of non-performing loans in several Member States. The Annual Growth Survey 2017 builds on the priorities set out in President Juncker’s State of the Union address, as well as on the Bratislava road map. The over-arching message from the annual Growth Survey is that we have to redouble efforts along the virtuous triangle of boosting investment, pursuing structural reforms and ensuring responsible fiscal policies, and in doing so we have to focus on social fairness and delivering more inclusive growth. A new element this year is a communication on the fiscal stance of the euro area. The letter of intent that accompanies the State of the Union speech announced that the Commission will propose a positive fiscal stance for the euro area in support of the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. The communication provides the Commission’s views on the appropriate euro area aggregate fiscal stance in the context of the institutional architecture of the Economic and Monetary Union. Of course, such an orientation should build on the legal frameworks set by the Stability and Growth Pact and take into account the broader fiscal sustainability concerns. The recommendation on the economic policy of the euro area highlights five areas for action: reforms that favour growth and productivity; a supportive fiscal stance; job creation and social fairness; strengthening the banking sector, and completion of our Economic and Monetary Union. The draft Joint Employment Report shows that employment and the social situation are gradually improving, while stressing clearly that there is, nevertheless, no room for complacency. The main challenges concern notably high levels of inequality; still high rates of youth unemployment and of those not in employment, education or training; long-term unemployment; and the under-representation of women in the labour market. The unprecedented inflow of asylum seekers and other migrants also calls for comprehensive integration policies. The package also includes the 2017 Alert Mechanism Report, which screens Member States for risks of macroeconomic imbalances and identifies countries for in-depth reviews. Thirteen in-depth reviews are announced in the Alert Mechanism Report, namely for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden. The results will be included in the country reports that the Commission will issue towards the end of February 2017. The reduction of the number of in-depth reviews compared to the last year, when 19 such reviews were carried out, reflects the recent progress made in addressing imbalances. Also, a number of vulnerabilities persist. The Commission also issued opinions on the draft budgetary plans received from the euro area Member States. We received those budgetary plans in October, and the findings have been summarised in a chapeau communication. This year, with regard to the Member States under the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, we found that for five countries – Germany, Estonia, Luxembourg, Slovakia and the Netherlands – their draft budgetary plans are compliant with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact. For four countries – Ireland, Malta, Austria and Latvia – the draft budgetary plans are broadly compliant. For six countries – Belgium, Italy, Cyprus, Lithuania Slovenia and Finland – the draft budgetary plans pose a risk of non-compliance. Concerning the Member States under the corrective arm of the Stability and Growth Pact, for France, the draft budgetary plan is found to be broadly compliant with the requirements of SGP. For Spain, the draft budgetary plan which was submitted under the no-policy-change scenario, is found to be at risk of non-compliance. Also for Portugal, the draft budgetary plan is found to be at risk of non-compliance. Portugal, however, is expected to correct the excessive deficit this year and to transit to the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact next year.  Spain and Portugal have also submitted reports on actions taken in the response to the Council decisions to step up the excessive deficit procedures. The Commission has in the meantime assessed the possible partial suspension of European structural and investment funds and engaged in a structured dialogue with the European Parliament. Taking into account the measures that Spain and Portugal have taken, the Commission’s view is that the excessive deficit procedure should be kept in abeyance at this point for both countries. Accordingly, the requirement for a proposal by the Commission to suspend part of the European structural and investment Funds is no longer present and there will be no such proposal by the Commission.  This autumn package is there to assess the EU and euro area dimension of the European Semester. In the coming weeks and months, the work will focus more on the country-specific dimension of the process. The Commission will present its country-specific analysis, including the in-depth reviews under the macroeconomic imbalances procedure and the country reports, towards the end of February next year.  In the run-up to the country-specific recommendations, scheduled for May next year, the Commission plans to intensify dialogue with the Member States and the social partners to develop a common understanding of successful reform implementation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Gunnar HÖKMARK", "mepid": "28124", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner for the statements. Let me first of all underline one thing: the Commission is the guardian of the Treaty and it has the responsibility to act within the legal framework – not to change it or cause hesitancy about the rules. That is why it is important that all actions regarding the Stability Pact are consistent with what has been legislated in this Chamber.  I will make three points. The recovery we are seeing is moving at a slow pace. It is to a high degree dependent on a unique monetary policy that is not sustainable in a long—term perspective, but it is also based upon the credibility of the Stability Pact and the stability of public finances. Do not risk that, Commissioner, by calling the Stability Pact and its rules into question.  Secondly, reforms and the consolidation of public finances are the best way to avoid austerity. Wherever you use deficits as a way to avoid structural reforms, you enter into austerity because austerity comes from spending more money than you have. As soon as you do that, you are creating problems for investment, for growth and for jobs. We can see this on the European map. Thirdly, budgets must be improved with quality. Member States must give priority to the spending that is most important before they increase the deficits. They must give priority to the important things and not have an excuse, in the end, for above minus 3%, for squeezing in the most important spending. They – and all of us – need to do it the other way round.  We want to fight austerity and unemployment with growth and structural reforms. We do not believe in deficits and increased debt burdens. We think that Europe shall go forward.

And it is on the rubble that austerity left behind that the new political order promoted by the populists thrives. It is no coincidence that Trump in America today promises a large investment plan of a trillion dollars: in the face of the new US activism, the European Union cannot remain helpless. The European Commission is right and I want to thank Commissioner Moscovici for his fundamental work. We need to move to a more expansive eurozone fiscal policy and the countries that have budget surpluses today have a duty to invest more. But we also need a major European initiative to support a more ambitious economic policy. Parliament is therefore right to define at this time the nature of Europe's fiscal capacity. For our group, the Commission's new approach to fiscal stance is a necessary turning point. I want to say clearly to those who are aiming at sabotaging this turning point - and I am referring in particular to Schäuble - that for us this fiscal stance is an impassable red line, on which we condition our support for this Commission and we will not tolerate any sabotage.

Well, colleagues, I think we should go back to the logic of the Maastricht Treaty. The accounts must be in order and the Member States that refuse to cooperate must be held accountable for their responsibility. We must also be able to impose sanctions on these Member States, and if necessary expel them from the eurozone when necessary. But what do we see? That the European Commission does not appear to be planning to celebrate the Maastricht Treaty today, but rather intends to bury the Treaty. What she proposes does not fit within the agreed framework. The Commission imagines itself as a kind of European Ministry of Finance. It proposes matters for which it has no competence, but above all it proposes matters that are not sensible. Our structural problems, as Mr Hökmark has already said, will not melt away.

I will focus on your Communication on the tax position. There are three statements in the Communication that I believe are correct: first, that the recovery is fragile - I believe that no one can doubt that; second, that basing our entire growth strategy on foreign demand is a suicidal strategy, given the context; and third, that we cannot trust everything to monetary policy being the solution to sustain growth. But then, one thing happens: you make an effort to present a proposal for an expansive fiscal position, but I have to tell you that it is too little, that it comes too late and that it is not consistent with the rules that we have, which is something that you they do not recognize. Too little, obviously, because practically what they are asking is to go a little further than the fiscal position this year, not much further. Too late because the damage done by the austerity policies throughout all these years is very high. And too inconsistent because it is a bit difficult to see how such a policy is consistent with the current governance standards that we have. The whole process lacks consistency, I have to tell you. The strict implementation of the budget recommendations that you made last year assumed a regressive fiscal position of 0.3%, even though you predicted that the fiscal position would be neutral. In other words, the coherence of all the forecasts for last year is absolutely evident. And that for me has three implications or shows three things: first, the volatility and uncertainty of the entire process that we are starting today; second, the endemic procyclicality of the Stability and Growth Pact; and, third, the persistent over-optimism of their forecasts. And, later, in relation to Communication, I also have to tell you something else, that they do not finish breaking a taboo that is very important: what geographical distribution of the aggregate fiscal position and the measures to be taken should be carried out. The calculations that we can see would imply that, for example, Germany, from the current 0.6% surplus should go to a negative fiscal position of 0.5%; or if Germany goes to a neutral fiscal position, that means that certain countries - for example, Spain - would not comply with the recommendations and forecasts that you have made. But it would be nice if you indicated that geographical distribution. Therefore, and by way of conclusion, Mr. Vice President, I have to tell you that, although it is too little and too late, I hope it turns out well, but the omens are not very good. The German minister and the Spanish minister, incomprehensibly, have already said that they do not agree. I believe that this Parliament must send a clear message that it is important that this year the fiscal position is expansionary because, if not, the recovery will not come. We are going to ask you to also advance, as I was saying, in the regional distribution, to indicate what regional distribution there must be.

There are ordinary people who are worried about their everyday lives, how they will manage, how the family will make the money enough for each month.

Last week, the European Commission completed its assessment of the Member States' budgetary policies and presented a package of economic and social priorities that, together with the economic data from the 2016 autumn forecast, will usher in the European Semester for the coming year. However, the European Semester does not meet with sustainability among the member states. Some do not adhere to the European Semester and the Stability and Growth Pact and do not have to incur any consequences for this: Contrary to what was announced in the summer, the Commission is now refraining from freezing structural funds for the deficit sinners Spain and Portugal - from sanction exemptions for Quite apart from latent refusals of budget restructuring like France and Italy. Others criticize the European Commission for setting wrong priorities and not taking vigorous action against deficit sinners. It is stated - especially from the German side - that the European Commission is single-handedly setting financial policy goals for the monetary union for the next semester, for which there is no legal basis, and at the same time is trying to change the entire architecture of financial policy coordination in the euro zone . The German side is receiving support from the Slovak Presidency, which is calling for a reform of the Stability Pact. The aim is to make the pact simpler and easier to understand. I quote the Ecofin President: If rules are nonsensical, you have to change them instead of circumventing them, otherwise you will destroy the rules. The credibility of the semester and the Stability Pact, and thus of the entire set of coordination rules, is at stake, unless it is already gambled away. If Member States in surplus are due to If macroeconomic imbalances are subject to a preventive component of the Stability Pact and countries that are subject to excessive deficit procedures have been getting away with unsanctioned procedures for years, flexibility can quickly be interpreted as a lack of principles.The entire eurozone continues to suffer from excessively high national debt, as the current autumn forecast confirms.With a few exceptions, however, budget consolidation is not progressing because the governments do not want to and do not have to implement any unpopular structural measures because they indirectly finance the ECB.That will not change if one or two Member States invest more.These investments do not solve the structural and financial problems of the others.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 12, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Sotirios ZARIANOPOULOS", "mepid": "125090", "text": "NI). - Mr President, with fears of a new round of crisis, embarrassment over Brexit and the election of Trump, the forthcoming elections in various countries with growing popular controversy but trapped in a reactionary direction, competition is intensifying worldwide and in the Union.

In addition, there are three Member States that have already had to be required to take significant corrections to address non-compliance. Ladies and gentlemen! What does this balance tell us? This balance sheet is clearly negative and it worries us about fiscal stability, the immense debt and the structural problems of many member states in the euro area. The balance sheet shows that the Commission is called upon in its control function as guardian of our mutually agreed rules that determine and secure our cooperation, and more than ever. A positive fiscal policy stance for the euro zone is no way out. A fiscal policy course for the euro zone is not even legally secured by our existing economic policy framework.

I see two reasons for this, two facts which mark this turning point. The first was the recognition that Spain and Portugal had taken effective action and that a suspension of structural funds was not necessary. I believe that the action of this Parliament in this direction has been decisive and I welcome it. Let us continue this structured dialogue with effective results. The second fact is this communication on the aggregate position of the euro area and the \"euro area\" recommendation which recognizes, in parallel with the renewal of the Juncker plan, that the aggregate position is essential if we want to stimulate growth and support investment to where it needs to be. For this, I also believe that the message that the President of the European Central Bank sends day after day - and he did it again yesterday - that monetary policy needs to be supported by an aggressive aggregate fiscal position, is of good quality. But if we welcome these two elements in your 2017 Annual Growth Survey, then two consequences must be drawn when it comes to specific recommendations for the euro area. First, we don't want any structural reform. We want \"new generation\" structural reforms, which boost human capital, for example. We also want all the consequences in fiscal matters to be drawn, in particular to support investment, but also to fight more effectively against inequalities, which remain a major concern. Finally, in the medium term, it will also be necessary to draw the consequences of this analysis. First, the Stability Pact needs to evolve and, above all, the roadmap that you need to set in motion with the White Paper on the reform of the European Union at 27 the need for budgetary capacity for the euro zone and for the completion of the tools enabling the Economic and Monetary Union to effectively serve the interests of the member countries of the zone must not be overlooked.(The speaker agreed to answer a \"blue card\" question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 28, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Patrick O'FLYNN", "mepid": "124940", "text": "  blue-card question. – Would Ms Berès agree with me that France currently faces the worst of all economic worlds, in that it is locked in a currency that is entirely unsuited to its needs and that reduces room for fiscal manoeuvre, and also has a governing party which has imposed an anti-business culture which is seeing stagnation and growing unemployment?

The intention of the legislator, when we drew up the six-pack, was to make the rules less likely to be interpreted, not to say twisted, based on compromise or political compromise.

This is a necessary recommendation that we have been urging for some time. The still too modest performance of the recovery, which remains exposed to international economic and political uncertainty, highlights the risk of a vicious circle, between low growth expectations and low investments, which can compromise the growth potential itself and transform the impact of the crisis from cyclical to structural. A greater role of fiscal policy is needed to stimulate investment, especially if we want to rely less on monetary policy stimulus in the future. To those who speak of excessive loosening of the rules I would like to remind 1) that in recent years the deficit of the euro area has collapsed from 6.2% to 1.5% in a few years; 2) that, if anything, the Commission's recommendation is proof that our rules need to improve, as country-specific recommendations would lead to a lower fiscal stance than the Commission itself deems necessary in the current macroeconomic environment. It is therefore necessary to work for a fiscal capacity of the euro area and improve our rules, starting with a revision of the matrix and the opening of a debate on a differentiated treatment between investments and current expenditure in the stability pact. Parliament will be actively involved in this debate, just as it has contributed to a wise choice that we welcome towards Spain and Portugal.

We agree: jobs are created by entrepreneurs, and most small entrepreneurs - if they already have innovative ideas, and they have enough entrepreneurial ideas - then often fail because of the bureaucracy. That means that the effort to get investment funding, the control effort is still far too great. Here you clearly have to start a campaign to reduce bureaucracy in rural areas, because rural areas can only function if regional economic cycles arise. The rural area is characterized by small parts, and it is also characterized by small businesses. We need these companies, we need these ideas, and that simply mustn't get lost in the bureaucratic jungle.

That is why we need to see the measures we are taking as a package of measures and not just pick one or another or a third element and discuss that without an overall context. That is why I would re-emphasise that there is a triangle of measures, a triangle of priorities, which we are proposing and all of those priorities are important: namely, to facilitate investment, to pursue structural reforms to modernise our economies, and to continue with responsible fiscal policies. And all of those elements are important if we are to ensure sustainable economic recovery. Something which is also important in the context of the European Semester is ownership by the Member States. That is why we need to have a deeper engagement with the Member States, but also with the social partners and other stakeholders in Member States so that we really see that our policies are followed through. And nowhere will we see it better than in the context of the implementation of country-specific recommendations. There have been many debates, also in this Parliament, on the level of implementation of country-specific recommendations. We discussed it last month and once again we see somewhere between limited and some progress in implementation. So certainly more work is needed in this regard. Then a number of questions were asked on the Communication on a positive fiscal stance for the euro area, including its legal basis. And there I would just reiterate what is said in the Communication itself, and which I also outlined in the introductory statements, namely that such orientation should build on the legal framework set by the Stability and Growth Pact and take into account broader fiscal sustainability concerns.  This is something which is very clearly outlined in the Communication itself, so the main logic is indeed that those Member States which are in excessive deficit will still need to pursue the adjustment path towards medium-term budgetary objectives in the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact and should continue to do so, whereas those Member States which have fiscal space should utilise it to stimulate the demand side of the economy and in particular to stimulate investment. So that is the overall logic of this proposal. A number of other questions were raised, including on how to motivate Member States, and I think once again that this motivation is first and foremost with engagement of Member States and strengthening their ownership on quality of public spending. This is something we also agree on and underline in our Communication: that the quality of public spending is as important as its quantity. A question was raised on climate change objectives. This is also reflected, for example, through our work on investment, on the European Structural Investment Fund where 20% is now earmarked for sustainable – sustainable from an elemental point of view – development on reducing bureaucracy. This is also an important work strand which we are pursuing, among other things, through our REFIT initiative and a number of sector-specific simplification proposals which we are putting forward. So once again, when we are working we always have to keep our mind on the main goal: to strengthen Europe’s economic recovery and to make it more sustainable. And I am looking forward to constructive cooperation with this Parliament towards the next steps of the European Semester.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 53, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "The discussion is closed.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 54, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Clara AGUILERA", "mepid": "125045", "text": "written. - I am glad to see that the European Commission is, slowly, but I hope with a sure step, changing economic policy, adapting it to the real needs of the Union.

On the one hand, in the case of all financial resources and financial instruments, so-called outsourced from the EU budget, the control powers of the EU institutions are reduced, and the possible market-distorting effects are not known. On the other hand, the conditions and criteria for obtaining funds are much more opaque compared to other areas of implementation, which is only further strengthened by the reference to bank secrecy. Furthermore, the Investment Fund’s approach is strictly focused on the financial return of projects, ignoring broader or indirect socio-economic-political aspects.

States, too, for too long have looked away from what we might call \"a tax hit-and-run\". The international financial system but also commercial relations - we have often spoken of it here - are riddled with gigantic flows of money laundering and tax evasion. The two phenomena often use the same channels, and only great efforts in terms of transparency make it possible to fight against these scourges for public revenues. It is precisely this spirit that has guided the reform project we are debating today. First, a substantial improvement will be made to European policy in this area with the new directive against money laundering and the financing of terrorism. It will provide new tools, among which - and it was eagerly awaited - a central and comprehensive register of all beneficial owners of companies and trusts. This information will be collected in each state by specific intelligence units. For the sake of clarity and efficiency that we, parliamentarians, share, the Commission, in the person of Pierre Moscovici - whose never-ending efforts with parliamentarians I welcome here to try to fight against this scourge of tax evasion - , considered that the tax authorities of each State should have direct and horizontal access to this data, and in particular to the central register that I mentioned earlier. It is therefore this measure which is being debated today and which will be implemented within the framework of the Union's administrative cooperation directive. The initiative deserves to be supported. It goes without saying that our tax administrations, in the context of their investigations, must be able to have direct access to the information necessary for their investigations. With the colleagues of the ECON committee, we wanted to guarantee this achievement, but we want to add an additional point. In the unanimous opinion, and as the Commission itself admits in its communications, faced with these essentially globalized phenomena, the most effective weapon for us is the automatic and compulsory exchange of information between the states. I wanted, along with all the shadow rapporteurs whom I thank here, that we propose the sharing of information between European states. A very simple example makes it possible to represent the stake which is capital. To prosecute cases of tax evasion by French or German taxpayers, for example, the tax authorities in our countries have a crucial need to know if they are hiding behind trusts or letterbox companies in another Member State. It is therefore important that this other Member State has access to this information and gives it to France or Germany. Only in this way will we be able to fight effectively, of course, against tax evasion. This project therefore also makes the reform consistent with its instrument, the administrative cooperation directive, which is an instrument for sharing information between States. So much for progress, this is what we offer you. I would still add one last point. In tax matters, as you know, it is always the Council which has the last word. As much as the Twenty-eight have a hard time agreeing on a generous policy of welcoming migrants, when it comes to taxation, the members of the Council systematically manage to take a position before the Parliament of so as to neglect our opinion and the position of MEPs. I think this has to stop and, if the vote is as unanimous as possible - that is what I want - then we will send a clear message to the Council. It's time to reaffirm in front of our fellow citizens, who are legitimately scandalized by what is happening with tax evasion cases, that we want to make this fight for a fairer redistribution an absolute priority.Thank you, dear colleagues, and thank you also to the shadow rapporteurs who have helped us so much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 65, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Pierre MOSCOVICI", "mepid": "1983", "text": "member of the Commission. - Madam President, Rapporteur Emmanuel Maurel, Ladies and Gentlemen, First of all allow me to address my very sincere congratulations to the rapporteur and to all those who were involved in the elaboration of this report because the work that has been done was very fast, it is of very high quality and it will allow very great progress. It is clear from the public debate, as was said by Emmanuel Maurel in his introduction, that fairness, equal treatment and social justice are very strong demands of our fellow citizens, both at the national level and at the national level. European level. Taxation is one of the areas where justice is absolutely necessary. This is even truer after the recent scandals that we have known - I am thinking of the most recent ones, the Panama papers or the Bahamas Leaks -, which revealed that, despite the progress that we have made, particularly in terms of tax transparency , tax evaders and anyone looking to evade taxes can still hide behind the opacity of offshore structures and trusts to circumvent the rules and to avoid any taxation, which is simply odious for our fellow citizens today . This Commission, as you mentioned - I thank you for having underlined it, Mr Rapporteur - has taken a step that I would describe as gigantic in terms of taxation by presenting and having adopted concrete proposals to improve transparency. and the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion, both for individuals and companies. The Union has made transparency its standard. We are pioneers in the implementation of international standards. I was talking about this last night with the Secretary General of the OECD, Mr Gurría, and all of our Member States are committed to these new initiatives. After the automatic exchange of financial data, this referred to as DAC 2, tax rulings, DAC 3, and country-by-country reports, DAC 4, the next barrier to break down is transparency in terms of beneficial owners. This will be DAC 5. The G20 also recognizes this and called for action on this. The information on beneficial owners that we are talking about today is essential in the fight against corruption and its corollary, money laundering. The directive that is on the table allows us to move forward. Once adopted, it will give tax authorities the much needed access to information on the beneficial owners of these opaque structures and trusts with little-known activities. The tax authorities of each Member State will be able to access the data which is currently collected under European anti-money laundering rules, in particular the information resulting from customer due diligence obligations and the information contained in the national registers of beneficial owners. With access to this information, tax authorities will be able to identify who is actually behind an opaque company or structure and respond quickly to situations of tax fraud and evasion. This access will allow a real leap forward in cross-border tax cooperation within the European Union and will give a valuable tool to the Member States which need it to protect the integrity of their tax systems and to fight against fraud and schemes. of tax evasion. I now come to the report by Mr Maurel and the amendments adopted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. It is truly an excellent report which recognizes the directive as a major step in the advancement of our fight and I welcome it greatly. This report proposes a number of amendments. I come back briefly on some of them without being exhaustive, in the first place to underline that, in many cases, the Commission fully agrees with the suggested developments. Secondly, we believe that the objectives pursued by certain amendments would be better addressed in the context of other initiatives. I will take two examples, if I may, Mr Rapporteur. Several of you have called for further extending the scope of this directive and making it even more ambitious. I therefore particularly note the request to provide, as of now, for an automatic exchange of information on the beneficial owners. Like you, I consider that fraudsters exploit our internal borders and therefore that transparency must apply beyond our borders. In its communication of 5 July, the Commission therefore undertook to examine how cross-border access to national information of Member States on the beneficial owners of trust companies can be done and this, in complete security. This issue will be covered by a separate proposal, as soon as more information is available on the G5 pilot project and taking into account international developments. In this perspective, it will also - this is my second remark - to take into account the result of the discussions on the proposed revision of the fourth anti-money laundering directive which already includes the interconnection of the registers of beneficial owners in the European Union. . These remarks do not call into question most of the amendments but suggest an approach which, in the same spirit, with the same objective, may be a little different or which, in any case, uses complementary vehicles. Our work is far from over. In reality, it never will be, but we must be in the race because the imagination of those who want to defraud or those who practice planning aggressive tax does not stop.You know my personal commitment, my conviction: it is that this revolution of transparency in which we are only just beginning.The Commission welcomes and I personally welcome the constant support of the European Parliament, its determined action on these issues of transparency and the fight against tax fraud and tax evasion.Together, I believe that we are really making things happen in an area where our fellow citizens see both the need and the usefulness of Europe.In these complicated times, there aren't that many.All the more reason to continue and pull this thread to the end.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 66, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Tom VANDENKENDELAERE", "mepid": "129164", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Stronger cooperation and enforceable international agreements are the only effective answer to the fears that globalization and internationalization have unleashed. Only then will we be able to protect our way of life and our social welfare states. I am really convinced of that. A good example of this is taxation. Only by working together can we close the net around tax evaders and tax havens and tackle aggressive tax planning. In recent years, the realization also seemed to have grown at a global level that there should at least be limits to the cutthroat tax competition with which countries steal each other's income, but with Trump as future tax evader in chief and the British in Brexit rules the waves mode, the international movement to an abrupt end. That is precisely why the European Union must assume its responsibility and fully assume its role in tax cooperation and transparency, both at a global level and within our own internal market. Today's bill fills a small but important gap in existing cooperation on tax matters between Member States and will help to expose opaque Panama Papers intermediates. Yet much more is needed to bring about real tax justice within the European Union. I am thinking, first of all, of the common list of tax havens. It must absolutely not become a watered-down compromise and must be accompanied by real sanctions. Second, I am thinking of the taxable corporate tax base. It must be harmonized within Europe.

Transparency: One of the main demands, as we have called in the results of the TAXE special committees on Lux Leaks, as we are now calling for in the Panama Papers Committee of Inquiry. But we will only achieve transparency in this area if we structure the exchange of information about the beneficial owners of companies in such a way that it is actually clear in all Member States who owns a company. I understand, Commissioner Moscovici, that you are referring to the revision of the fourth money laundering directive, but that does not help us at the moment. We don't know if it will come in this form and how it will come when. I am with you that if we have a network of business registers, an automatic exchange of information may no longer be necessary. But that's just a maybe. We should therefore insist at this point in the procedure that we come to an automatic exchange of information on the beneficial owners of companies between the Member States. Because if you do not commit to anything here, then, I predict, the same thing will happen as happened with the question of the exchange of information on tax rulings of multinational companies. For decades, the member states were obliged to exchange the information. Did you do it? They never did. Only the obligation to exchange moves member states to provide each other with information - information that is necessary to combat tax fraud, information that is necessary and imperative to combat money laundering. So we should be more ambitious at this point. So we should try To oblige Member States to do so too.Because only transparency guarantees us that we will achieve more fairness in the tax area, less money laundering, and anyone who weakens transparency is playing into the shadow economy, money laundering.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 70, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Pirkko RUOHONEN-LERNER", "mepid": "132366", "text": "On behalf of the ECR Group. - Mr President, the Commission's proposal for a new anti-money laundering directive is a good one, as is Mr Maurel's draft report. However, I would like to draw attention to two things. Firstly, trusts, the importance of which has already been recognized in previous speeches, which is very good. It seems that there are still loopholes in the proposal, such as the possibility of marking business leaders as owners if the real owners are not known. In addition, it would continue to be possible to hide holdings through trusts if their trustees are, for example, in Panama or other non-EU tax havens. My second concern relates to the ownership of listed shares, which has been discussed too little in the fight against money laundering. Many EU countries use nominee registers for share ownership, where the identification of beneficial owners depends entirely on the banks that manage them. In addition, it is often possible to use remote brokers as intermediaries, which may be located in other EU countries. When these remotes through remote brokers are chained, there is an increased risk that identifying the true owners will not work as it should.

Between 60 and 80 percent of the money that rolls into the casinos, we have no idea where they actually come from. When we also know that those who manage the gaming tables have a share in the amount of money that goes through the casino, we understand that there is also no greater desire to control where the money comes from. For that reason, I believe that the Commission should take a serious look at the money laundering, at the illegal transactions, that are actually taking place in our casino world.

We underline, however, that it seems essential to us that this information is exchanged automatically for this change to actually have practical effects. Regarding the fight against money laundering, however, it is important not to entertain illusions. In our opinion, it is not possible to combat this phenomenon by relying only on the due diligence duties of private companies and the financial system. As has been criticized by many organizations, the results of the fight against money laundering have been residual over the past few decades. This is due to the conflicts of interest of the entities that are responsible for reporting suspicious movements; this is due to money laundering and the legal instruments that were developed by developed countries in the name of liberalizing the economy; so it is, finally, because the big financial groups, those too big to fail and where the overwhelming majority of legal and illegal funds go, actually rule national governments and European institutions. In other words, money laundering, as well as tax evasion and fraud, are one of the visible faces of the liberal economy and the capitalist system.

He was very clear about the importance of ensuring that corporations pay their fair share of tax, but also about the fact that there are still many obstacles in our way, the most obvious being continued secrecy and the jurisdictions that offer this to the rich and powerful.  The Anti-Money-Laundering Directive is key to tackling not just tax avoidance but the web of secrecy, money-laundering and criminal activity that is perpetuated by secrecy jurisdictions, such as the various UK overseas territories whose hidden activity was revealed in the Panama Papers. The revision to the Directive on Administrative Cooperation with regard to anti-money-laundering information that we are debating here today is therefore very welcome. I am pleased that we have cross-party agreement on this file and that Parliament has agreed that the Commission should have been more ambitious in its proposal.  While this revision to the directive is an important step forward, we believe that there continue to be several loopholes that could be used by tax-dodging experts to circumvent the automatic exchange of information, thereby undermining its effectiveness. As an example, synthetic tax residence certificates are readily available in countries such as Panama and the Bahamas to avoid reporting to the Union authority. To counter this, any previous residence in the EU within the last 10 years should be deemed as an indication of current residence, and a tax clearance certificate should be used to establish actual residence.  I welcome the fact that we have agreed on a strong and united position from this Parliament on the automatic exchange of information between Member States’ tax authorities, as well as our Green call for the Commission to have access to the information exchanged. We emphasise to the Council and Commission our clear view that making the information readily available in this way increases our ability to fight tax fraud.  I am delighted that we have agreed a strong and united position. I hope we will now progress towards making all such tax information public, as well as ensuring that the whistleblowers whom we currently rely on to cast light into the dark corners of the world’s financial system will be properly protected.

For too long we have seen in many countries and globally a blind eye turned to tax evasion and money laundering: crimes that make up the dark web of our current system used for terror finance, organised crimes by corrupt people and organised criminals.  Therefore we need transparency. Transparency is key. We need automatic cooperation between our tax authorities and our law enforcement authorities, and we need to exchange information of high quality. But secondly, we also need to see our banks and all intermediaries take responsibility for their own operations and businesses. The banks carry out due diligence and they need to be a barrier to illegal economic activities that they have been facilitating, without any real consequences to their business, for too long. Let me give one example. In 2015 Nordea Bank in Sweden was fined the maximum administrative fine of only EUR 5 million after ‘major deficiencies’ were found in the bank’s work to prevent money laundering. In the same year Nordea made a high profit, many times the fine that they actually got. So I want to thank the rapporteur for underlining two key principles: exchange of anti—money-laundering information between our tax authorities needs to be mandatory and automatic and we need to step up the fight against this.

We finally started to realize that it is very important who is actually the actual owner of the business. Hiding behind complicated connections, behind straw companies and various procurators is a fog that we can dispel with regulations. Finally, it has also become clear that the tax authorities need to work together, that they need to be connected if we want to step on the toes of tax fraudsters. This exchange must be self-evident and must be automatic. And last but not least, we have finally come to the realization that we need healthy tax competition. We do not need excessive taxes that stifle companies, nor do we need individual arrangements that give selected companies special benefits. Of course, the consolidated tax base is one of those instruments that could contribute to this. And last but not least, let’s also ask ourselves why we do all this.

I therefore welcome the level of ambition that some of you have mentioned and that Mr Maurel's report has perfectly reflected. I can assure you that this directive will create the conditions for setting up a mechanism for cross-border access to information on beneficial owners, a mechanism which many of you are keen on. In this way, brick by brick, we are building a solid defense structure against fraud and tax evasion in Europe, which is a robust systemic response against external threats to the tax bases of Member States, a path towards more tax fairness for all citizens and all European businesses. The political pressure, in the good sense of the word, exerted by the Parliament, particularly by its ECON committees and now PANA, is decisive for the success of our initiatives. I will perhaps make a few more specific comments in response to the comments made by parliamentarians. I have noted your request for an automatic exchange of information and I share this objective. As I said, the Commission will propose such an exchange in a separate proposal as soon as we have enough information, precisely on how best to proceed. This will be done in coordination with the development of the anti-money laundering directive currently discussed by this Parliament, as well as by the Council. Several of you have pointed out that there are still activities or structures that are beyond transparency. I of course agree with you. The Commission is working on this and will continue with your help to extend this transparency as much as possible. Several of you, including Mr. Kofod, mentioned the liability of banks. In the Commission, we consider not only that the responsibility of the banks exists, but that all those who facilitate aggressive tax planning must be included in the field of our vigilance. We have launched a public consultation - as I said - on this subject in order to determine the best way to bring these facilitators of all kinds, from all origins and from all origins, face to face with their responsibilities. As regards the agreement in the Council, I take good note of your remarks on the fact that the Council did not wait for Parliament's opinion to agree on a general approach on this particular subject. Fortunately, our work will continue on increasing transparency through other legal instruments. So there is obviously a major utility in the debates taking place here. I am happy, as always, to continue this work, happy to be able to do it in close coordination and in partnership with the European Parliament to achieve, in Europe, the fairer tax system that our fellow citizens expect.

However, it is also important to further increase the transparency of banking and financial transactions.

This is crucial from an environmental point of view, as the new regulation has abolished the fishing effort regime, or the number of days a fishing vessel can spend at sea. In practice, this means that vessels with a very limited number of days no longer have to fish near the coast, where predominantly juvenile fish stocks are concentrated. This is an important measure for the conservation of fish stocks, and I believe that this is another step towards the stability of the biological environment in the seas and the prevention of further climate change.

It will allow vessels to no longer be forced to fish near the shore or in areas with a lower incidence of cod.

The Commission and Parliament therefore turned to the Court of Justice, which ultimately ruled in favor of Parliament. The contested regulation was subsequently repealed and the Parliament was granted the right to co-decide directly on fishing plans. Among other measures, the compromise proposal for a regulation envisages maintaining the fishing mortality rate at a level acceptable according to scientific advice, which should allow fish stocks to recover. Similarly, Member States should develop and promote measures to prevent unwanted catches. In addition, the plan provides for exemptions for vessels that do not contribute to cod mortality, and Member States should focus on measures to reduce cod discards.

The purpose of that regulation is to amend and clarify certain articles of the regulation and thus to improve it.

Unfortunately, the European Council did not follow the co-decision procedure between the European Parliament and the European Council and adopted a regulation under Article 43 (3) TFEU. Neither the European Parliament nor the European Commission agreed with this. That is why the case went to the European Court of Justice.

In practice, this has led to a deterioration of the cod stock. The new rules are more flexible in terms of TACs and fishing quotas and streamline the rules on landing obligations. Progress has also been made in tightening discards for unusable fish. 30% of the Earth's seas are overfished, and marine fish stocks are at risk. It is therefore understandable that, in order to maintain marine fish stocks, the European Union is forced to restrict sea fishing accordingly. Therefore, the Common Fisheries Policy must pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, ie aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant part of the fishponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 areas. These fish farms pose no threat to the natural values ​​of these areas.

It was not until the referral and a judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Union to put an end to the conflict of interpretation of the Lisbon Treaty between the two institutions. At issue is the sensitive issue of quotas, for which the treaties grant the Council the sole decision-making prerogative. The European Parliament is the co-decision maker on other fishing regulations. As the multiannual plans closely touched on quotas, the European Parliament was therefore threatening to encroach on the Council's prerogatives in this area. The Court of Justice finally ruled partially in favor of Parliament, ruling that Parliament's determination of environmental principles applying to quotas was compatible with the Treaties.

This step approved the legislative text finalized in the second reading agreement between the EP and the Council. New legislation is needed as the old fishing plan used a complex catch system. In practice, this has led to a deterioration of the cod stock. The new rules are more flexible in terms of TACs and fishing quotas and streamline the rules on landing obligations. Progress has also been made in tightening discards for unusable fish. 30% of the Earth's seas are overfished, and marine fish stocks are at risk. It is therefore understandable that, in order to maintain marine fish stocks, the European Union is forced to restrict sea fishing accordingly. Therefore, the Common Fisheries Policy must pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, ie aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. A significant part of the fishponds in Hungary are located in Natura 2000 areas. These fish farms pose no threat to the natural values ​​of these areas. Moreover, in many cases it is due to our closed system of fishponds that the unique wetland associations they have created or preserved are.

But every time this Parliament gets its hands on the subject it always starts inserting a different agenda to do with tax harmonisation and with treating jurisdictions with lower tax, or tax havens as they are invariably called here, as being intrinsically illicit rather than being, as they are, a spur to the rest of us to keep tax rates within a manageable level.

In this sense, including the entire collection of typified information in the context of the fight against money laundering in terms of administrative cooperation represents a positive step. We underline, however, that only in cases where this information is exchanged automatically can practical results be obtained. Regarding the fight against money laundering, however, it is important not to entertain illusions. It will not be possible to combat this phenomenon by relying only on the due diligence duties of private companies and the financial system. As has been criticized by many organizations, the results of the fight against money laundering have been residual over the past few decades. In other words, money laundering, as well as tax evasion and fraud, are one of the faces of the liberal economy and the capitalist system.

The directive therefore calls on the Member States to make the most of the synergies resulting from national, Union and international cooperation between the authorities involved in the fight against crime and abuse. An important aspect is the automatic, mandatory and continuous exchange of information in the field of taxation introduced by this Directive, which should apply from January 2018. This will ensure maximum transparency and provide the authorities with a basic tool to prevent and combat fraud of all kinds.

I also consider it important to acknowledge the fact that, without the ECB's long-term refinancing operations last year, Europe would have had to face much greater exchange rate fluctuations.

In its work to maintain monetary stability and promote the smooth functioning of the payment system, the ECB expects inflation close to 0.2% for 2016 and rising in 2017. This wish becomes difficult to achieve due to the unfavorable macroeconomic situation . While there is no doubt the need for structural reforms aimed at tackling stable unemployment and low productivity, in addition to what has been listed, the level of risk that the ECB's budget is reaching in implementing the established programs is equally unquestionable. The impact of these operations on the real economy is also puzzling. Proof of this is the lack of follow-up on the restart of investments and consumption.

That is why I consider it important to work even more closely with Parliament so that real democratic control can take place. I welcome the fact that, as in previous years, this year's report insisted on the fact, clearly enshrined in the Treaties, that the central and sole role of the Central Bank is to keep the exchange rate stable, including the single currency, the euro, and thus in the right context. the ECB’s policy. I also consider it important to acknowledge the fact that, without the ECB's long-term refinancing operations last year, Europe would have had to face much greater exchange rate fluctuations.

I also consider it important to acknowledge the fact that, without the ECB's long-term refinancing operation last year, Europe would have had to face much greater exchange rate fluctuations.

First of all, because level 2 measures must be made to be fair and adequate and that implementation is monitored at national level. Furthermore, to date, little progress has been made in building a single market for retail financial services and, due to a large number of barriers, cross-border activity is still limited. This is neither good for consumers nor for innovative businesses, or for the general functioning of the European economy. Finally, if well managed, digitization could create the momentum needed to start removing the obstacles to cross-border activity. There is a need to advance the retail financial services agenda by strengthening the Union's capacity for data collection and analysis, making identification in practice and creating and maintaining a level playing field. It is also necessary to eliminate unnecessary differences between EU member states and those that do not belong to it.

I support the EP's motion for a resolution on the \"Green Paper on Retail Financial Services\". In recent years, great efforts have been made to create a single market for financial services in the EU, but the integration of retail financial services does not seem to have reached its maximum capacity yet. For example, one of the advantages of the single market should be increased competition. However, in some markets, competition is not effective, especially in the payments and banking sectors. In other words, consumers cannot benefit from cheaper or higher quality services in other EU Member States. Without sustained efforts, European financial markets risk remaining fragmented.

When we arm and organize ourselves to be armed together, without designating an adversary, it is because we designate the whole world as a potential adversary. Are you talking about a defense? But against whom? It is not specified. There is no common European policy - as we know - in foreign affairs, so here we are back to the origins of Europe, since the first text that was submitted to the peoples of Europe in 1954 , was the European Defense Community. My country answered \"no\" as it would answer \"no\" again if asked.

No Member State or organization can tackle the new challenges on an unprecedented scale alone. In this situation, the EU must do everything in its power to find the means to guarantee security.

It also urges EU Member States to make use of the possibilities offered by the Lisbon Treaty with regard to the Common Security and Defense Policy (CSDP), in particular with regard to permanent structured cooperation.

In addition, a meeting of defense ministers should be set up within the Council to ensure permanent political leadership and coordinate the establishment of a European Defense Union.

In this situation, the EU must do everything in its power to ensure the security of its citizens.

Inland waterway passenger transport also plays an important role in coastal and remote areas and is linked to the great issue of exploitation of inland waterways. In a continent populated by many rivers, lakes, streams and navigable waterways, I find it essential that transport on these waterways goes alongside and possibly exceeds road transport, helping to reduce CO2 emissions and decrease the traffic problem. urban.

On the other hand, this mode of transport is under-exploited in favor of road transport, resulting in traffic congestion and increased pollution, especially in cities.

Waterborne passenger transport, including sea ferries, inland waterway ferries, barges and passenger ships, plays a key role in achieving a more sustainable and efficient European transport sector. A large proportion of daily migrant transport takes place by road, creating bottlenecks. Greater use of passenger water transport would facilitate this and reduce CO2 emissions. Most of Europe is characterized by navigable rivers, and in many areas of Europe, travel by ferry or passenger ship would be more sustainable, easier and faster, which would increase the social and economic well-being of the region.

Its importance in creating a single European transport network is extremely important.

In Poland, inland transport, also in the passenger dimension, has been neglected for many years, despite the fact that its potential in our geographical conditions is very large. It is not only about communication possibilities, but also about the chance to create many jobs in shipyards and in modernizing infrastructure. The importance of this means of transport for the development of the tourist offer is also invaluable, which in many regions of Poland already includes the use of passenger water transport. For the Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship it is a key topic and a chance for development by creating new communication opportunities for investors. The strategic location of my region means that it could be an important junction for water transport not only from the point of view of Poland, but the entire Central and Eastern Europe.

Indeed, the Union is the largest donor at the world level (68 billion euros in 2015). European aid is the victim of dispersion since almost 75% of it is allocated by the Member States according to national procedures in order to maintain a strong link with former colonies (France, the Netherlands, Spain, etc. .).

In particular, I would like to emphasize the following three principles, which I consider to be fundamental vectors for increasing the effectiveness of our development policies: 1. The role of the private sector is crucial. In addition to traditional governmental and non-governmental development organizations, the private sector is a real and effective partner in our development strategies and is a new source of financing for development aid in general; 2. The European Union cannot bear responsibility (and consequences) for the failure of global development policies and ongoing armed conflicts. New actors in development aid, such as China, Brazil, Turkey, Russia or India, need to be more involved, not only because of their geographical proximity, their historical ties, but also because of their recent or current experience with their own development; 3. Last but not least, it should be recalled that the effectiveness of development aid depends to a large extent on developing countries themselves.

Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, honourable Members, thank you all for keeping a constant focus on Syria in your plenary debates. I am really sorry I could not be with you in person last month, but I believe this is the fourth or fifth time this year that we have had a plenary debate on our work on Syria. Last month I was in Brussels for the Afghanistan conference, another important file in which the European Union has a very important part to play, but the Slovak Presidency briefed me on your October exchanges, and they also provided a very important input for the discussions we had at the Foreign Affairs Council both in October and last week.  We have discussed Syria again, as I mentioned, in the Foreign Affairs Council both in October and last week, on Monday to be precise, and I have engaged in a number of meetings with both Syrian, regional and international actors, so for me this debate is a very precious opportunity to update you with the most recent initiatives and contacts and work we are carrying on, starting from the work on the humanitarian side that, together with Christos Stylianides, we have carried out relentlessly, I would say, in these last months.  Over the last few days, there has been a new escalation of violence against the eastern neighbourhoods of Aleppo. The resumption of airstrikes has worsened the humanitarian situation even further, particularly because it has left hundreds of thousands of besieged civilians without access to functioning hospitals. Together with Christos and his team, whom I would like to praise, and together with the United Nations, we are working literally day and night to create the conditions to let the humanitarian aid in, and to let the wounded out, of East Aleppo, as as well as to other besieged areas all across the Syrian territory.  To reach this goal, we are engaging both internationally with all relevant actors, and on the ground. We are in constant contact with the city council of eastern Aleppo, as well as with civilian administrations in several parts of Syria. We are helping them provide services to the local population in the areas where this is possible. Our activity on the ground is increasingly recognised, first of all by the local players, by the Syrians themselves, and this is for me – and I can speak also on behalf of Christos and all the people who are working with us on this – the number one priority, that our work reaches the Syrians on the ground. Believe me when I tell you of our frustration at not managing to do more, but all the humanitarian work that is done is basically thanks also, I cannot say all, but almost all, to the funding, the work, the support, the logistics, the commitment of the European Union. Here again, I would like to thank our team, both on the ground and in Brussels, which has been working really at an incredible rhythm on this, in full coordination always, with the United Nations.  Our work, as I said, is increasingly recognised inside Syria but also internationally. The contacts and the channels we have developed in this field will be crucial also to any settlement and to the transition. As you all know, the delivery of humanitarian aid is proving to be a very difficult exercise, given the lack of a broader political agreement on the cessation of hostilities, and we have realised very clearly in these last couple of months that the military-to-military work on the cessation of hostilities is more and more difficult in the absence of a wider political understanding on the future of Syria. So what we risk is a vicious circle.  This is why, after having discussed this with the Foreign Ministers and with the Heads of State and Governments in the Foreign Affairs Council and in the European Council, I have started to reach out to the key regional actors on the future of Syria. This means that in the last weeks I met and had talks with the foreign ministers or leaders, presidents, of different countries of the region on a clear agenda. In the name of transparency, and also in sharing with you this work, let me go into a rather detailed list again. I know this is not the politics we need to talk – we would also need to talk politics, but I think it is also important for you to know exactly what this regional outreach is meaning by now.  Meetings with Foreign Minister Al Thani of Qatar in Brussels. Then I headed to Tehran where I met President Rouhani and Foreign Minister Zarif, and two days later to Saudi Arabia to see King Salman. Last week I discussed this in Brussels with Foreign Minister Bassil of Lebanon. Over the weekend I met with Emirates Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah and Foreign Minister of Jordan Nasser Judeh. Contacts with others, notably Turkish Foreign Minister Çavuşoğlu and Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry will also follow. And on Friday, just a few days ago, we hosted a meeting with the Syrian opposition groups, the leaders of different groups that I met at length in Brussels to share this process with them, to listen to their views to ensure full ownership and an active participation on their side. And obviously all of this is done in constant contact with Staffan de Mistura and his team, both in Geneva and in the United Nations headquarters in New York.  So now to content. The focus of this outreach is on the future of Syria, looking in particular at the post-conflict end state. What I am trying to do is identify areas of common ground and possible elements of a positive agenda with all the key actors. The issues that we are discussing in the framework of this outreach include political accountability, decentralisation or devolution, participation and protection of all components of the very diverse Syrian society. I know that this Chamber is particularly attentive to the situation of Christians in the region; this is also part of our outreach. Reconciliation, especially the local exercises of reconciliation, and economic reconstruction. On the latter let me be extremely clear: the European Union is and will be ready to engage in the economic reconstruction of the country, together with other partners. But, let me stress as I stress it to our partners in the region, this will only happen once a political transition has begun under the framework of UN Security Council Resolution 2254.  This work aims at improving the chances for the success of the UN mandate and the UN Special Envoy for the intra-Syrian talks. Our regional outreach can help create some space and some confidence for the talks to start because of course it is, as I said, for the Syrians to decide the future of the country in direct talks under UN auspices, but in the meantime, if as the European Union we can provide some space regionally to accompany this process, it could only be useful. In six years of war we should have learned something about the conflict in Syria. At times, an agreement between global powers could not hold, even if it was found, because the situation was out of control on the ground. In other cases, local ceasefires did not hold even if they were reached, because there was no agreement on a broader political level, either in the region or internationally. As I said, sometimes it is a vicious circle. Things locally do not hold because the international regional framework is not accompanying; at some other times you find an agreement on regional and international level and you do not have the local actors on your side.  So peace in Syria will require at the same time an agreement among world powers, the UN framework, among regional actors, the work we are trying to do, and all local players. I understand that it might sound strange to talk and to work on post-conflict at exactly the moment when war still rages on, and yet, talking about reconstruction, reconciliation, post-conflict, the system of governance, that could ensure Syria future a way, is a way of maybe opening the door for a process of peace. Because only if we start putting all the pieces together and to create some kind of consensus among the regional actors and among the citizens will we contribute to building peace in Syria.  Now as you know very well, and as I repeated many times, the European Union is not militarily involved in this war. This is the result of a political decision, one that was taken years ago, that I fully share and that unites us all in Europe. We are not a party to the conflict. But this is not a constraint on our diplomatic action. On the contrary, this puts us in a privileged position as we work for peace. From our position, we understand better than others that there is no military solution to the war. We see that every escalation leads us further away, and not closer, to peace. We are in a privileged position as we can talk to everybody, we do talk to everybody, we are trusted by everybody, and I am convinced that the European Union will be, and is becoming, an indispensable force to make peace in Syria possible and to achieve it concretely on the ground.

It fills me with unspeakable shame.  The Syrian war has now lasted longer than the Second World War, and the Council still does not have a common position even while the impact of the war in Syria continues to shake the EU at its core. It is beyond comprehension, and particularly Prime Minister Renzi’s veto, preventing sanctions on Russia for the role that Putin’s army plays in bombing children, is a disgrace. Putin has taken maximum advantage of our absence.  So we do need an EU strategy, not on paper but one that leads to meaningful action, otherwise our negotiating position or persuasion towards third countries is far too weak. And while the EU and Member States are the main humanitarian donors, two thirds of Syrians do not have regular access to water and six million children need life-saving assistance. We are clearly not doing enough. Starvation is used as a war crime; look at Lebanon to draw your own conclusions. Declaring the statement with Turkey on migration as the Holy Grail will not solve our problems, especially when the EU is not delivering its part by ensuring relocation.

So collectively, all our institutions together, all our Member States together –  the institutions together means also Parliament – were called on to play a more pronounced role in mediating a peace deal for Syria. I remember very well, during the State of the Union speech in September, not only President Juncker but many of you called for a pronounced work of the European Union on the future of Syria. This is why it is quite surprising for me to hear some of you say that we should not focus on the future of Syria. I would invite some coherence here in what we ask ourselves to do.  I heard very clearly the first two interventions here, by Mr Preda and Mr Boştinaru, prioritising the two key elements of our work: first, delivering humanitarian aid and making sure this can happen; second, using all the diplomatic tools we have to find, or rather to build, a political solution to put an end to the war in Syria. This is exactly the work we are doing: providing humanitarian aid, together with the UN, together with international agencies, together with international NGOs, with our people on the ground, still. You cannot imagining how difficult the conditions are, or maybe you can, and talking to all relevant players in the region to try and open ways for the political solution to the crisis. So if we are the ones, not some of them, but the ones financing humanitarian aid and making sure it can be delivered –obviously this does not depend only on us – but if we were not there, for sure there would be no humanitarian aid at all in the country.  Secondly, if we are the ones today still keeping open the talks, the dialogue, in a situation that otherwise is rather stalled, then I am sorry: I do not share the views of the few of you who have said that Europe should be ashamed. I believe we are not the ones who should be ashamed about Syria. We are doing our job, finally, maybe, but we are. The point is, this is not enough. We need the unity of the international community, so this is also part of our work. Six years of war; five years of polarisation in the international community. You remember that very well. This year for the first time, thanks in part to our work in the international support group, we managed to have unity in the Security Council for the first time ever – even though we are not a member of the Security Council. You know that very well, but we managed to facilitate consensus in the Security Council twice, and those were the only weeks where aid was delivered, Syrians were getting out into the streets, trying to live a normal life again. These are the efforts we have to make in order to continue to build the unity of the international community. Otherwise, our efforts alone will be necessary and indispensable. We will continue to do that, but doing so alone would not be enough. We have to be a key player, but we cannot pretend we will be the only player. We have to build alliances, starting with those we have worked with well these past months.  We have our role to play, and we are now playing it fully. This was maybe not necessarily the case in past years in the first years of the conflict, but here, now, the European Union is there, politically and from a humanitarian perspective – not from a military perspective. This is not because we do not have a European army, but because of a clear political decision that was taken and I am sincerely proud that we are not a military player on the ground. We are not part of the war in Syria. Having said that, why focus on post-conflict? Some of you asked this and some others explained why, but let me say a few words on that.  Firstly, many conflicts in the past were solved exactly when the parties started to see the endgame shaping up. Sometimes it works, sometimes it does not, but we are facing a war and a crisis that does not allow us to leave any of the possibilities untried. When you start shaping the endgame, the parties would feel more confident engaging in direct talks, so this is a contribution we can make to the UN efforts to restart direct talks and find common ground. Secondly, we need to be ready for the construction – the reconstruction – of Syria. At a certain moment, it will come; it will cost an enormous amount of money. How many conflicts in our region have faced the problem of nothing following the end of the conflict and have thus fallen back into conflict after maybe a few months or a few years? Working on post-conflict reconstruction today is fundamental so as to be ready at the moment when arms are finally laid down. Thirdly, to give hope to the Syrians – not only to the refugees, but also to the internally displaced people and those that are still living in Syria in their own communities; to offer positive incentives; to offer the dividends for peace that make it possible for the parties to engage. Last but not least, you mentioned empowering the local players that can still be a force for good in their country – the women, the small experiences of civil society that are still struggling, the churches, the communities that are taking care of their own everyday lives, the children, and the women. This is work that the European Union does, but does not expect any of the big military players to do on the ground. We can be – and we are – a force for good in Syria. Others are not, true – definitely true! We cannot delete this issue, but we can maybe compensate, maybe engage, or maybe encourage a more positive dynamic on the ground and diplomatically. This is the work we are doing. I thank you for the support in this effort. It will be needed, because it will not be something that we will solve in one week or one month. I am sure that we are now on the right track as regards what the European Union can and should do, and what it finally is doing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider":

I see that the other group leaders – most of them – are present here in the Chamber. Our relationship with Turkey is at a crossroads because Turkey itself is at a crossroads. On the night of 15 July – we discussed it in September, I remember it very well – during the attempted coup d’état, we stood on the side of Turkey’s democracy and the democratic institutions. We stood on the side of the Turkish people who took to the streets and bravely confronted the tanks. We stood on the side of the over 200 innocent people who were shot down that night. We stood on the side of the Parliament as it was being bombed and of the Turkish parties – all of them that spoke against the coup and in support of democracy – all of them. We supported Turkish democracy on 15 July and it is precisely Turkish democracy that we support today as we see the leaders of the People’s Democratic Party (HDP), a legitimate party in the Turkish Parliament, arrested and imprisoned. The arrest of the co-chairs of HDP, as well as the detention of several of its deputies, adds to a long list of extremely worrying developments. These include the consideration of the reinstatement of the death penalty, continued restrictions on freedom of expression, the closure of media outlets and the arrests of journalists and academics, the suspension of thousands of civil servants with a very worrying situation for the judicial system. We have always been clear that the Turkish authorities have a legitimate right to hold the perpetrators of the coup and of terrorist attacks accountable for their actions. We have also called on all political parties to unequivocally condemn terrorist violence. At the same time we know that the respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms is the strongest antidote to extremism and terrorism. Any allegation of wrongdoing must be established via transparent procedures in all individual cases. Individual criminal liability can only be established with full respect for the separation of powers, the independence of the judiciary and the right of every individual to a fair trial. We all agreed on this opposition in the Foreign Affairs Council just one week ago, on Monday. All Foreign Ministers have agreed on the importance of maintaining a unified and clear European Union position in line with our declaration on behalf of all 28 Member States issued earlier in November. Our relations with Turkey have reached a crucial point. I believe the best way to strengthen Turkey’s democracy – the most effective way – is by engaging with Turkey and by keeping channels open. The accession process has achieved important results in many fields, from the energy sector to both our economies and businesses to the talks on Cyprus. Let me stress today how important the talks on Cyprus are for us all. Turkey seems to be heading towards constitutional reform, and I would like to stress that this reform should serve as a platform to strengthen checks and balances, strengthen participatory democracy and address the Kurdish issue effectively. As we have made clear on many occasions, the European Union stands ready to fully support the country to achieve these goals. The work goes on and I recently met Turkey’s Europe Minister, Omer Celik, and also with the Secretary—General of the Council of Europe, Jagland. This cooperation with the Council of Europe is particularly important and I really hope Turkey will address the concerns of the Council’s Commissioners for Human Rights. What is crucial in the short term is a swift, fair and independent domestic redress mechanism to be in place. Failing this, we are going to see a flood of cases before the European Court of Human Rights. I know talks are ongoing with the Council of Europe, of which Turkey is a member, to address this issue. I hope this work will bring results. This much the European Union and Turkey can do together starting, as I said, with Cyprus, but also our fight against terrorism, our economies, our businesses, refugees and the future of Syria which we have we just discussed, and the stability of the Caucasus. In all these fields we both need constant and reciprocal dialogue. I always say that foreign policy is about building win-win solutions. If the accession process came to an end, I believe we would both find ourselves in a lose-lose scenario. Europe would lose an important channel for dialogue and leverage with Turkey, Turkey would lose a lot, and we would all lose an opportunity for greater friendship and cooperation among our peoples. In this spirit, we should also ask ourselves which tools and which instruments we have at our disposal in order to increase, and not to reduce, our leverage on Turkey’s reforms and on its society as a whole. In order to do so we need full clarity from our Turkish partners on what they want. In that regard, it is clear that moving from rhetoric to action on the issue of the death penalty would be a signal that Turkey does not want to be a member of the European family – neither a member of the Council of Europe, which it is now, nor of the European Union. Membership means, above all, sharing the values Europe stands for, and capital punishment is certainly not one of them. (Applause) It is good to see that at least here in our Chamber we do. Some say that Turkey has to choose between the West and the East. Personally, I do not agree. Turkey can – and should – stay true to its nature as a bridge between worlds and cultures. But if Turkey moves further away from our European Union and from democracy, it would lose part of its own heritage, its own identity, its own culture and also its own power. This would be in no—one’s interests and certainly not in the interests of the Turkish people, all of them. The last time I was in Turkey we all agreed that we need to talk to each other more – which we are doing – and a little bit less about each other. Sometimes we are doing that. I believe that this is the attitude we need both on the part of the Turkish Government and inside our Union. We are looking forward to hearing your views. Both Commissioner Hahn and I will be listening very carefully to your interventions. Again, let me thank you all and especially, as I said, noticing the presence of so many group leaders for a debate that I believe will be essential to shaping the future of our relations with Turkey.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1989, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. –Mrs. President, Commissioner Hahn, my dear colleagues! We had the attempted coup in July, and it was impressive to see in Turkey how civil society stood up, how civil society fought, in partnership with the politicians in Turkey for the rule of law, for democracy, for a world without military leadership . Turkey can be proud of having successfully defended democracy and the rule of law against the military. Incidentally, we can self-critically say that we may have said too little about that in this phase: the support for the forces in Turkey. But if you defend the rule of law, you have to implement it now: this is exactly where we are now. For us as the EPP Group, one thing is clear: we respect Turkey. We want a stable Turkey, we want a democratic Turkey. In my speech today I would like to remind you of a great Turk, namely Ataturk. Peace at home - peace in the world, was one of his sentences that he coined. Another sentence from Ataturk was “Sovereignty should not be built on fear. The sovereignty that rests solely on arms cannot be maintained. ”That is actually the message for Turkey, not to argue with our European values ​​first, but to use internal Turkish arguments to advertise what Turkey is traditionally. Respect is a key concept here, respect for one's own people. The coup was a crime against the Turkish people and the masterminds must be convicted. But the coup must not be abused now. Respect for other opinions. Turkey was always strong when it was tolerant. However, since the coup, 110,000 Turks have been removed from their posts in politics and administration, 36,000 people have been arrested and 138 MPs were deprived of their immunity. Today, according to the Rule of Law Index, Turkey has fallen behind Iran and Myanmar in terms of the rule of law. 170 media outlets were closed. Respect for the partners: Turkey is a reliable NATO partner, which is why we are counting on partnership on these issues too. It is also a reliable trading partner, which is why it comes as a surprise when threats are now being made that Turkey can build partnerships with China and Russia and thus play Europe off. Respect for partners looks different. Last but not least: respect for your own long-term interests. Turkey needs Europe. The EU wants good relations. There are ten times more Turkish exports to Europe than to China and Russia combined. The European Union is today paying EUR 650 million to the Turks to support the local economy and administration. Now we see that Turkish growth is effectively stalling. That is the record of the last few days, the last weeks, the last months, and it is a shocking record. Commissioner Mogherini, our Vice-President and High Representative, said that too. But now it is up to us to use clear wording. For us, of course, that means that we can't just watch the development. There cannot be business as usual. That is why my group supports the call for the existing accession talks to be frozen for the time being, not to be broken off - I would like to emphasize: not to break off - but now to send the signal that we are not currently holding any further talks with a Turkey in such a state can. The signal must also be clear: anyone who decides to introduce the death penalty cannot become a member of the European Union. That has to be expressed clearly on our part to be brought.My aim is not to accuse first and foremost.My concern is that we appeal to Turkey as a friend, as a partner, not to continue on the path it is taking today, in the interests of its own Turkish citizens, not primarily in the interests of Europe, but because it is for Turkeywrong way is.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1990, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I greet Vice-President Mogherini, some figures have already been mentioned by my colleague Weber.

Now, all this is not justified even in the light of a coup d'état, which we immediately challenged and condemned. It is not justifiable! It is a dramatic situation, with respect to which even a group such as the Socialist and Democratic Group, which has always been and remains in favor of Turkey's accession, cannot fail to raise the issue of a freeze on accession talks; not of an interruption but of a freezing which is a strong political signal, on the one hand to Erdogan: do not proceed on this path! Do not proceed on the path of political repression of rights! You go back in the interest of your people, who want a modern democracy anchored in Europe. And for this we must send a precise signal with the freezing of the talks but we must leave the door to dialogue open so that we can, in the future - I hope in the near future - resume the discussion and work together for a full democratization of the Turkey, which represents a partner which, for geopolitical, geostrategic and in my view also religious reasons, is fundamental for the European Union.

There are many who had hoped it could become a model for a new form of Muslim democracy in countries across the Middle East and North Africa, just as Christian democracy developed in Europe. I am confident that many members of the AK Party still share this vision. But we all have concerns over the actions of President Erdogan. Had he simply been content to be elected as a ceremonial President, rather than seeking more power as an executive President, there might be a little less criticism. But what we have seen recently raises serious concerns: opponents being arrested, media being closed, minorities being persecuted. Across this Chamber today, I believe many of us are now united in saying ‘Enough is enough.’ I fully understand why some politicians here, and in our national capitals, are reluctant to criticise Erdogan. I appreciate that there are much wider geopolitical factors at play: sustaining the EU-Turkey migration deal, after Turkey’s generosity in hosting three million refugees; security cooperation – for Turkey too has suffered from terrorist attacks; and not wanting to push Erdogan into Putin’s arms or into a corner. However, we need to be honest with each other, and, in wanting to be honest with Turkey, we need to be honest with ourselves. For far too long, we have dishonestly dangled the prospect of EU membership in front of Turkey. You and I know there are so many reasons why it may not happen in our lifetimes: prejudice against a predominantly non-Christian nation, whose land mass is mostly in Asia; fears over Turkey’s future voting weight in the European Parliament and Council; concerns over borders with Iran, Syria and Iraq as the EU seeks to extend its Common Security and Defence Policy – to name just a few reasons. But the EU continues to pretend that it is ‘business as usual’ in relations with Turkey. Yet more sticking plaster across growing cracks! In common with other parliamentary Groups, the ECR has members who are for, against, and agnostic on, Turkish membership of the Union, but we can all see that the current relationship is not working. So, instead of ‘business as usual’, let us build a new relationship based not on false promises but on honesty. Let us build a new relationship based not necessarily on EU membership but on real cooperation. Let us build a new relationship based not on just fighting today’s fires and problems but also on preparing for the challenges we will all face for decades to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1992, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, for a moment I thought Mr Kamall was saying let’s merge the Brexit and the Turkish files, but I do not think that is what he was saying. Ms Mogherini, you are saying that we need to know what the Turkish authorities want. I think we all know what the Turkish authorities want. They want accession to the European Union; they want a visa-free regime as quickly as possible; they want additional money, because of the deal we did on migration; and they certainly want no interference and no criticism from our side on what is happening, this shift to an autocratic system in Ankara and in Turkey. That is what they want. But let’s not fool ourselves anymore. We all know that this is not in compliance with European values, that it is not in compliance with European principles and that it shows, I would say, a lack of courage not to see that President Erdoğan is for the moment closing the opposition media, jailing journalists and at the same time also criminalising a number of members of the Turkish Parliament. That is the reality. So instead of pretending ‘oh! we still have an open channel if we continue these talks’, I think in such circumstances we are fooling ourselves, we are fooling our citizens and also fooling the Turkish citizens – because many Turkish citizens think that Europe is their future and they do not find a future in these circumstances with a regime that is becoming more and more autocratic. So instead of continuing the illusion of accession talks with a regime that is becoming more and more authoritarian, I think we would lose credibility to do so, and you have heard it, there is in my opinion in this House, unanimity – or close to unanimity, there is never unanimity in a House such as the European Parliament – but nearly I think, a broad majority, to say you have to freeze the accession talks for the moment. You have put a number of conditions on the restarting of these accession talks once Turkey complies with them. That brings me to the broader picture because, let’s be honest, there is a broader picture. Something is happening in our neighbourhood. It was Solana I think who said in 2003 ‘well, everything is okay in our neighbourhood, there is a ring of friends around Europe’. I can tell you today that it is more like a ring of autocrats around Europe – Erdoğan, Putin... I am not going so far as to put Trump on that little list, but they are all doing one thing: bashing Europe, bashing our values, bashing and fighting against our European democracy. Let’s be honest, let’s face it, you have to face it, we have to face it: what is happening is that Erdoğan is against every Turkish movement in whatever country of the European Union which is not in line with him. Putin is directly financing even groups here in this Parliament – always nationalists, populists and anti-Europeans. And let’s face it, Mr Trump is not much better than that. His most important strategic advisor, Bannon, wants to launch an extreme right-wing website – Breitbart – he has done it already in the US but he wants to do it also in Paris and Berlin to influence the German elections, and to influence the French elections. Mr Trump even wants to take over the task of Her Majesty The Queen by appointing the future ambassadors of Britain. Mr Farage is not here, but it would be interesting if he could tell us if that is ‘taking back control’ in Britain. I think one clown in Washington is more than enough. We do not need more than that, dear colleagues. (Applause) So, in a certain sense Ms Mogherini, that is what I hope, with the Foreign Ministers and with the leaders, and you are aware of this. There is a fifth column active in Europe for the moment and the fifth column are not the refugees coming in from Syria, as Le Pen and Farage are saying. No, the fifth column are the cronies of a number of autocratic leaders, be it Putin, be it Erdoğan – I hope it will not be Trump tomorrow – who want to undermine the European Union. It is time to fight back and make it not happen. And if our European leaders do not do it, then we in the European Parliament should do it. I think it is now or never.

Before we start negotiations on this very difficult resolution today, after many debates with representatives of the Turkish Parliament, I would like to say one more thing: I and my group and the majority of this House want the coup in Turkey to be cleared up, and we are for the constitutional punishment of those who are found to be responsible for fair trials. What is unreasonable for us is that we are now being asked to take mass persecution, mass arrest, and disproportionate action against all Kurdish politicians, against everyone who is somehow close to the Gülen movement, against judges who make independent judgments , against liberal journalists, against writers who form a free opinion in this whole dispute, as part of the enlightenment. I believe that the developments in recent weeks have been such for all of us that we have said that relations with Turkey cannot go on as they did before this crash into a situation that no longer has anything to do with the rule of law. And that is why the majority of this House has taken the view that freezing negotiations with Turkey on membership is an appropriate response. I have to tell you: I've been to Turkey a lot recently. I'm always scared. Most recently the arrest of Ahmet Türk, a highly respected man who stands for the peace process and who is the mayor of this multicultural, multilingual, multi-religious, wonderful city of Mardin. I am really shocked by what is happening. And yet it is difficult for me to imagine the future. So I am in favor of the signal that we are sending to Turkey with this resolution. But at the same time - addressed to former President Gül, for example, Addressed to the former Prime Minister Davutoğlu, addressed to all our colleagues in the Turkish Parliament - to say: What has guided us in Turkey policy, namely that we wanted to achieve peace and security and democracy for the European citizens and for the Turkish citizens still guides me. And I want us not to stop looking for dialogue and understanding with Turkey. This is the last time I am telling you this in my role as chairman of the Greens / EFA group, and I would be very sad if, after twelve years of involvement in Turkey policy, we lost all bridges to Turkey. It would also be very sad for me because in all the talks that I have had with Turkish oppositionists and dissidents in recent weeks, the following appeal has been made: keep the dialogue open!

Erdogan's counter-coup is bolstering his authoritarian power and legitimate parliamentary and civil society opposition to his government, as well as the freedom of expression of the press and citizens, are being stifled. With endless purges, a systematic repression of the opponents of the Turkish government is taking place, particularly ferocious against the Kurdish minority: it is carried out through a disproportionate number of arrests, dismissals, expulsion of university professors, public and private employees, members of the judiciary and of Parliament, and the closure of newspapers, to which is added the chilling hypothesis of the reintroduction of the death penalty and legislative interventions damaging the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. The news released by the press states that Erdogan would now have the numbers for a constitutional reform in the \"hyper-presidentialist\" sense, to grant himself even more authoritarian power in the form. There is also talk of a reprehensible bill, presented by the president's party, in order to decriminalize the abuse of minors and which would further aggravate the serious phenomenon of child brides. This situation contrasts not only with Turkey's commitments to join the European Union, but also with international obligations to protect human rights.

This is the situation of a country that is outside the rules, as well as the moral and historical vision of our European democracy. It is a country and a regime against which we, unlike other situations, should have already adopted sanctions and then definitively stopped the negotiations.

Madam President, as we all know, Turkey is a country that has never been governed democratically. In fact, the recent coup of July 15th gave President Erdogan the alibi to turn the country into a dictatorship. The Turkish President constantly accuses the European Union of not accepting his country as a full member for fifty years. Of course, it does not refer to the fact that she has made no effort to meet all the required conditions. In addition, it threatens the European Union to overwhelm it with millions of illegal immigrants, threatens Greece with war, maintains occupation troops on 37% of the territory of Cyprus, has invaded Syria and also persecutes with medieval methods any of its political opponents, over which the threat of the death penalty is pending. It also applies principles and methods of genocide to the Kurds living in the eastern part of Turkey. His latest achievement is that, in an interview with NATO representatives, he threatened that Turkey would join the Shanghai Pact, a military alliance controlled by Russia and China. As you can see, such a country has no place in the European Union. Turkey's accession process must be stopped immediately.

Objectively, Turkey is an important partner for us and we should not lose sight of that. A democratic and constitutional Turkey is of great importance to us. But at the same time we have to see that the development is going in a different direction, and we see that the coup that we condemn - including the participation of the Gülen movement - is being used by the current government to an extent that is not proportional to it is. As for the arrests of MPs, the deprivation of immunity, the issues related to the rights of journalists, the dismissals to an extent that is really no longer understandable, all that is, I believe, a development that makes it clear that the negotiation should be temporarily suspended until this issue has been clarified. I think everything else can no longer be explained. We should also make it clear that the introduction of the death penalty means that the event is over. But at the same time we should also see that we have instruments. We are not dependent on Turkey. The customs union is one such example. The economic development of Turkey has to do with the customs union and with the fact that two thirds of the direct investments in Turkey come from the European Union. It is important that it also becomes clear that the refugees are not just about the interests of the European Union, but about our support for the refugees, whom we do not want to withdraw. That helps the people, the three million who have been taken in Turkey, that the refugee agreement is an important thing. I believe that we should therefore take a sensible middle path that makes it clear that accession is further away than ever. That has to be made clear by suspending negotiations. For this Basically, you should apply the appropriate pressure and show other instruments.But overall, I believe it is important that we make it clear with Turkey on this issue that we will not allow ourselves to be insulted.For example, the EU sees the PKK as a terrorist organization and the claim by Turkish ministers that we support terrorists is an incredible insult to the European Union that we would not accept.But on the other hand, a colleague mentioned Cyprus here.It would be nice if the agreement in Cyprus could be reached between the various parties.You should keep that in mind for a moment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2007, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI", "mepid": "28314", "text": "  I wish to give you some information.

There is a serious threat of terrorism, both from ISIS and PKK, the war next door in Syria resulting in three million refugees and, on top of that, the coup attempt last summer.

Many people live in fear for their loved ones, who have been dismissed or arrested without any legal proceedings taking place even four months after the coup attempt. Tens of thousands of families are directly affected by the purges, including 145 journalists and 10 of our colleagues – parliamentarians – who are in jail.

Is it really necessary to pass the death penalty to put an end to these negotiations, which have been deeply dishonest for many years? We like to forget that the immunity of the 138 MPs was lifted before the coup, that Turkey was already moving away from Europe before the coup. After the attempted coup, the whole thing just happened much faster, and a lot more people looked and realized: We are completely diverging. But this process was conducted in a deeply dishonest way on our part even before this coup attempt. Basically, it's like a failed relationship in which each of the two tells the other: You have to break up. President Erdoğan tells the Europeans: You have to explain if you do not want to negotiate with us. We say: Turkey should declare that it no longer wants to negotiate with us. The negotiations are dishonest. Incidentally, the height of dishonesty can also be seen in the beautiful, confused contribution by our otherwise highly valued colleague Elmar Brok.

Well, do we perhaps want to recall the ambiguities in the fight against terrorism, which for years have made it the highway of international jihadism? Yet there, perhaps, no one complained or perhaps few, because it was convenient. We also want to recall the territorial, neo-imperialist ambitions towards Aleppo, Mosul, Syrian Kurdistan, the intention to question decades-old treaties, the will to deny the right to self-determination of the brave Kurds of Rojava, to intervene with the operation \"Euphrates Shield\" to fight their advance, rather than to face Daesh? Or do we still want to repeat what many have said, namely the continuous denial of human rights, civil and political liberties, the arrest of twelve parliamentarians like us, who have lost immunity and are now in Turkish jails? Or do we still want to remember the arrest of 142 journalists, the latest Akin Atalay on 11 November? Not to mention the prescriptions, purges of tens of thousands of officials, teachers, judges and policemen. And finally the proposal to decriminalize sexual violence against minors thanks to the shotgun marriage.

His latest comments suggesting that Turkey, a NATO member state, could join the non-democratic China and Russia-led Shanghai Cooperation Council, highlights my concerns.

Let us remind ourselves that it is his friend Russia, Mr Putin, and China that have done most to prevent any action on Syria at the UN Security Council.

Also on behalf of Vice-President Mogherini, I would like to thank you very much for the again very multifaceted discussion here in the House. I assume that this will also be reflected in the decision-making process. I can only repeat: our annual report on Turkey has shown the facts objectively. Unfortunately, this time too - I would almost like to say - we had to paint a gloomy picture which - as I could also see today - is pretty unanimously shared in this house. Turkey has been moving away from the European Union for some time - one could almost say: for a number of years - at least not in the direction of the European Union. That is the reality that we have to face and that we cannot negate. Everyone in this House of Democracy knows what has to happen: we need an end to the demolition of democracy and Turkey's clear commitment to the rule of law. To be honest: a state of emergency and the rule of law are not grounds for exclusion, on the contrary, one can and must uphold the rule of law principles even in a state of emergency. So here, too, it is in Turkey's interest to document that, both politically and economically. The current situation could very quickly articulate itself in a very serious loss of stability and flow into it, especially in south-east Turkey, but also beyond that in the Middle East. First and foremost, we need clarity from Turkey itself about its strategy - I'm not saying now whether it wants to join the EU or not, but about its strategy - how it really wants to handle it with regard to the European perspective . The leadership of Turkey must understand that they are leading their country further and further away from a credible EU perspective. Nobody should therefore underestimate the seriousness of the situation. And I think the speeches here today were very clear. At the Council of Foreign Ministers a little over a week ago, Federica Mogherini and I myself were able to clearly establish that the Member States have so far not been willing to take drastic steps, but are largely relying on commitment - on our commitment, on all of us, including that of the Member States themselves We must therefore continue to press for Turkey to adhere to its democratic and constitutional obligations that it has taken upon itself. I have to point out again: Turkey - and that was its aim itself - is a candidate country, and a candidate country has to acknowledge that it is bound by the highest and highest standards. No compromises can be made in this direction. But there is also something like red lines - this has also become clear several times today. I repeat it again, and I attach particular importance to the fact that the introduction of the death penalty, for example, would be such a clear dark red line. Let us not forget that the abolition of the death penalty in 2004 was a key condition for opening negotiations in 2005. One thing is clear: Turkey will always remain a close partner, regardless of the constellation: in trade, in migration, in foreign and security policy, in energy issues. Geography is destiny - so that is not the question. What we need is a Turkey that is clear about its own perspective and its own role. And it should also be a Turkey that is not just made up of Erdoğan, so to speak, and that is also our obligation. We are talking about 80 million people, many of whom have a clear European perspective.

There is a pressure lever on the regime. It is the financial cost and sanctions, as imposed elsewhere. Now, as we freeze capital openings, the Erdogan regime will enjoy huge economic benefits and privileges from the Turkey-EU Customs Union and the pre-accession funds it will use to consolidate more power.

The same two-state solution that since Oslo has been identified as the objective of all Israeli Governments, of the Palestinian leadership and of the international community. This to us is a clear position and also a clear objective not only of ours, but also that we share with the rest of the international community and of the parties. As the July report of the Quartet points out, action is needed to preserve the possibility of achieving this goal that is commonly shared, at least formally. Stopping the expansion of settlements is an integral part of the efforts to keep the solution of two viable and contiguous states on the table. The so-called regularisation bill, which passed a preliminary reading in the Knesset would allow for the ex-post legalisation of Israeli outposts in the occupied West Bank. It would enable essentially the confiscation of the private property rights of Palestinian land owners in the West Bank for the benefit of settlers. This would mean crossing a new threshold, even under Israeli law, for the settlement enterprise in the West Bank. It would also mean the exact opposite of what the Quartet that has called for, namely preserving the two-state solution. The debate in Israel on the regularisation bill has not concluded, but the choices are clear: either to uphold the principle of the two-state solution, or to go down the path of a one-state reality which will only lead to further conflict and instability at a time when the Middle East needs all the stability it can get. The choice belongs to Israel, but I believe it is only normal that we express our own views as any friend would do. The Quartet report on which the European Union has worked very much has identified the process to retroactively legalise outposts as a threat against a two-state solution. There is an international consensus on this because the report is the result of common work we have done. It is true there has been a strong EU involvement and leadership in this, but we’ve done this together with the UN, the US and the Russian Federation. So these statements that we have in the report of the Quartet that we presented in July is a statement that we share with our friends in the international community. We have a very detailed description in the report of the situation on the ground, and a shared assessment of the risk it poses to peace. But is also important to keep in mind that the debate on the regularisation bill is controversial inside the Israeli leadership and inside the Israeli society, and that the process is still open. The Israeli Attorney General himself has been very explicit that this bill is unconstitutional under Israeli law, against previous rulings by Israel’s Supreme Court and in breach of international law. A final decision, as I said, has not been taken yet and I hope that the Israeli Government and legislators will do the right thing. We are in contact with the authorities in Israel and we’ve made the position of the European Union very clear to the government of Israel. We will continue to follow developments on this issue very closely together with Member States. Let me stress here the European Union is fully united on this issue. As we also reflected in the Quartet report, our goal remains to help find a new path to successful final status negotiations. We need to rebuild the conditions for a peace process that can bring results – as I said several times in this House, not a process for the sake of a process – actually today even more than before we need to preserve, recreate political conditions and I would say that today even more than yesterday, it is crucial that the European Union builds and preserves international unity on this issue. Today is more important than yesterday, both on the fundamental coordinates of the two-state solution and on the way to get there. Our role is more important than ever today. Our regional partners can also play a major role in promoting and supporting a solution. The Arab Peace Initiative in particular, with its vision for a comprehensive Arab-Israeli peace, remains a key basis and offers significant opportunities, including with regard to regional security that I believe would be extremely beneficial for Israel itself. At the same time, we know that real peace requires a real commitment from the Israeli and Palestinian leaderships and this is why the internal Israeli debate is so important to us. We’ve talked about settlement policy, where we sometimes differ – I would say often differ – from the Israeli Government, but there has also recently been some positive steps such as plans and pyramids for Palestinian construction inside Area C and this was also not uncontroversial at all within the Israeli Government and opinions. So I believe we should not only criticise when we do not agree, but also acknowledge what we see as positive steps and encourage more of this and also more ambitious steps that lead to real progress on the ground. So let me conclude on a more personal note. Two months ago I was in Jerusalem for the funeral of a great Israeli man and a great man of peace, Shimon Peres. It was a very sad moment also for me personally, I had known him for many years, and yet it showed that hope is still alive. An important gesture came that day from President Abbas – his presence at the funeral in Jerusalem and the handshake with Prime Minister Netanyahu were little steps in the right direction, a little moment of hope. And the night before the funeral I had the opportunity to have a long meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu, in which he recognised, as Peres did, that only peace can bring security to Israel. So in difficult times for the Middle East we need to keep our eyes wide open, not only for the extremely worrying developments but also for any glimpses of hope and seize every opportunity that comes our way to make it grow. I know this Parliament will keep its attention high both on the worrying developments, but also on the opportunities for peace, and encourage and accompany our work for making them grow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2072, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, my group wanted to change the title of this debate. Unfortunately, we did not succeed, but our position remains the same. In the current context in the Middle East, it makes little sense to discuss the situation in the West Bank, including the settlements, isolating it from the rest given the many facets of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. If our objective is to move forward towards peace, I do not believe that our debate is very useful if we focus on the settlements. This is also reflected in the Quartet's July report, which identifies as obstacles not only this issue, but also terrorism, incitement to violence, the proliferation of armed groups and the lack of unity of the Palestinian side, as well as the very tense situation in the Gaza Strip. We should approach this situation as a whole, since all these elements are an obstacle to peace. Then, the issue of settlements must indeed be resolved through negotiations, but along with the other controversial issues, such as borders, security arrangements and the status of refugees on both sides. But the problem is that the peace negotiations are now at a standstill. Our efforts should be channeled to move towards creating an environment that allows for the resumption of serious and effective negotiations. We all know it here: there is no alternative and there is no possible substitute for direct negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. This question is very clear, it is the Palestinians who are now refusing negotiations. Finally, I believe that Europe must seriously reflect on how to take into account the new situation at international level in its approach to the Middle East peace process.

Since we embarked one year ago on an unsuccessful structured dialogue with Israel, demolitions are on the rise and new settlements have been decided. It is important to stop this trend, not only because this is a loss of European taxpayers’ money, but because we have to stop further displacement of Palestinian families living in this area and ensure that European aid goes effectively to those in need. There is no doubt that Israel has an obligation to respect international humanitarian law and to stop the expansion of settlements in this area and beyond. Israel is our partner in one of the most important and most insecure regions on earth, one of the few reliable partners in the Middle East in turmoil. But Israel has to assume its responsibility for its actions as a sovereign and democratic state, and to ensure the respect of its own international commitments and democratic principles that it stands by. The establishment of the settlements as it stands today have been repeatedly and almost unanimously condemned by the international community. This effectively divides the West Bank and makes the possibility of a viable Palestinian state more remote. Indeed, continuing on the current path will make the prospect of a two-state solution remote while this is the only outcome to achieve an enduring peace for the two sides who need it, the Israelis and the Palestinians. Therefore, the main objective of the EU should be to further invest in the Middle East peace process.

Moreover, and this has been heard here in plenary all afternoon, I think that with the election of Trump as the new president of the United States, we can also expect a change with regard to the Middle East. Mrs Mogherini, I would like to ask you some very specific questions. In May this year, we had an in-depth debate here and you promised me that you would argue for reimbursement of European Union projects that have been destroyed. My colleague Jean Arthuis has been on site and has been able to determine a few things. They have always taught me: if you break something from someone else, you have to pay for it. How far along are you in that process and will Israel indeed pay back our projects that it destroyed? Are you also ready to present conclusions on the Middle East peace process at the December European Council? I think the time has come to put everything together and I hope you can put forward a position there. Then later in the UN Security Council, as Europe, we can support one position on a resolution on settlements. And finally, Mrs Mogherini, we have been getting reports from our diplomats on the ground in East Jerusalem for several years now. However, we have to say that very little has happened to those reports, that the implementation of those recommendations is not really that far off.

You told us six months ago that you would take measures to claim compensation or restitution for EU projects demolished by Israel in the West Bank. Demolitions have continued. They have increased dramatically, and yet you have failed to take any action. It would be nice to have an answer about what prevented you, for instance, from subtracting the equivalent of the demolition from bilateral Commission programmes with Israel, such as twinning or Horizon 2020. Mrs Mogherini, you have a historic opportunity to advance a differentiation policy across EU-Israel relations, distinguishing Israel proper from the settlements.

It is not the first time we have debated the situation in the West Bank although it is, I believe, the first time we have done so with a specific focus on settlements. I have noted that this is an issue on which, sometimes, we have more unity among the Member States than we do in this Chamber, which is perfectly fine and normal for me. Be sure that our work on the two—state solution and all its implications is – and remains – a top priority for me and for the European institutions. On a personal note, I will add a comment – which I remember I have made already in this Chamber in one of our recent debates on the Middle East and on Israel—Palestine in particular – namely that I sometimes note, with a certain degree of embarrassment, that some Members of Parliament, and sometimes the most vocal and the most convinced in asking that this issue should remain our number one priority, are, for as long as they are speaking, extremely convinced that it is a top priority, yet as soon as they switch off their microphones they leave the room. Once again, there are not so many of us here to discuss this. So, please, if you really believe that this is the number one priority, and you say the European Union should be consistent, then at least spend these 15 minutes in the Chamber and demonstrate with your actions what you say. I am sorry, but this is, for me, a matter of personal consistency. I am sure we will have other occasions to discuss this, and I hope that, next time at least, those who are asking me to do more will at least stay in the Chamber for the entire debate – which is not asking too much, at the end of the day. Obviously I very much appreciate those of you who have stayed. Firstly, we are working very actively with the regional powers and with the international players. Some of you referred to the fact that the next US administration might have a different approach to this issue, which will place on our shoulders – and is already placing on our shoulders – a responsibility even greater than that which we have borne in the past. We are fully exploring these possibilities, but with an approach based on working with the parties in Israel and in Palestine and working with the regional powers. Here again. we are giving this issue more attention than some of the regional powers are at the moment, as they are distracted by other crises. Sometimes – I will tell you very openly – I feel that we, as Europeans, are the ones who are working more convincingly on this. It is constantly on our agenda, both in the Council and here in Parliament. I realise that this is no longer always the case for other partners around the world, and that is why I put such emphasis on the need for us to build, preserve and nourish regional and international unity on this, because the European Union is a key player here in terms of working with Israel and working with Palestine. However, this will not be something we manage to do alone. We will need, especially, the Arab countries, particularly around the Arab Peace Initiative and the Arab League. That is why I am glad that this is going to be one of the issues we discuss at our EU—Arab League ministerial summit in December. We need to build the common vision and common action in the region and in the international community. There is a lot that you can do. I appreciate – and I took note of – all the suggestions about what I can do on my side, both on the Commission side and on the Council side. But let me stress that you, as Members of Parliament, do have power and a role, if you play it, because the European Parliament is part of the European Union and its institutions. I appreciate, in particular, what Ms Sehnalová mentioned about the meeting with the Knesset Members. Your parliamentary contacts with the Knesset are particularly important with a view to passing a message and working to create space for political decisions to be taken on the Israeli side. The same can go for the Palestinian side. For instance, an issue that is particularly important to me – so much so that I focused most of my introductory remarks on it, and I noticed some of you have also underscored it – is that of the decisions the Knesset is taking at this moment, in these weeks, with the preliminary indication that has already been passed and the decisions still to be finalised. This is the time for Members of the European Parliament to liaise with, and reach out to, Members of Knesset and to pass on your own vision of what is happening, establishing contacts in a constructive and frank working relationship. Parliamentary diplomacy can help a great deal and complement the work we can do at our level. This is encouragement for those of you already doing this, and also a plea for you to think about what you can do yourselves. We would be more than glad to coordinate and work together, as we often do in this respect because, again, there are key moments – and I believe this is one of them – when the decision—making process is still open and decisive messages can be heard. I would like to make one last point, which was not raised in the debate tonight although I am convinced that it is a key element today more than in the past, namely that we should focus our actions especially on supporting the conditions for peace in the respective societies in Israel and Palestine. In particular, investing in the peace camps on both sides is something that is becoming quite urgent because the old generation is the one that was living in the days of the Oslo process, while the young generation has grown up with the despair of seeing Oslo not implemented. I believe that specific work that the European Union could do – fruitfully and in a very positive manner – would be to invest in the younger generations, on both the Israeli and the Palestinian sides, to work for constituencies for peace on both sides. At the end of the day, we will need such a basis if we want to create the right conditions. Thank you very much for all your contributions and our exchanges, which I always enjoy hearing. I am sure that we will come back to this debate soon. Again, work on my side personally continues. I invite you also to take some steps on parliamentary diplomacy, especially at the present time when decision—making in the Knesset, especially in relation to settlement legislation, is open. I think you can effectively contribute to our work in the weeks ahead.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2100, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Ildikó GÁLL-PELCZ", "mepid": "102886", "text": "I close the debate.I would like to inform you that the vote on the resolution will take place at a later plenary session.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2101, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Cristian-Silviu BUŞOI", "mepid": "38420", "text": "  in writing. – The international community agreed on the two-state solution at the Oslo Accords and the Israeli Government and the Palestinian leadership should continue negotiations on this main objective in direct peace, even though there might be issues in dispute, such as the settlements, as agreed upon between Israelis and Palestinians in the framework of the abovementioned Accords.

If in 2003 the EU leaders were announcing to the world that Europe has never been so prosperous, so secure nor so free, now, 13 years later, they are forced to recognise that we live in times of existential crisis within and beyond the European Union. Naturally, we should ask why is that. How did we get there? What have we done wrong? But primarily, we should ask what should we do to respond successfully to these times of existential crisis, and strengthening CSDP is a major component of that answer. That is why the report is of the opinion that a thorough and substantial revision of the CSDP is needed in order to enable the UN, its Member States to contribute in a decisive way to the security of the Union, to the management of international crisis and to asserting the EU strategic autonomy, recalling that no country can face the current security challenges on its own. In the relative benign security environment prevalent until now, the EU and its Member States could allow themselves to actuate CSDP mainly with crisis management performed in relative distant places. Now the conflicts around us have multiplied and have become intertwined, spilling through terrorism and refugees into the EU area. Security and defence is no longer only a cry for help coming from a proud defence industry confronted with increasing difficulties like it was the EU Council on Defence in December 2013. Now security and defence is a major, if not even the main concern of European citizens which was finally heard by the EU leaders. Consequently things started to move, and only last week the implementation plan on security and defence has been approved by the member countries. And that, let me tell you, that surprised us, and we had to introduce a number of amendments in order to synch the report with the realities in the field. The Commission in turn has advanced a number of defence-related initiatives, for instance the defence action plan and the defence industrial policy, getting involved in a support of a pilot plan on defence research run by EDA, the only institution we have for that kind of activity whose role would have to be strengthened in consequence, and instilling more flexibility in the instrument for peace and stability. Naturally, this is a big step compared to the current practices. The EU money was not used for defence and is already resisted in this Parliament. However, if we really want to defend our Union we should be prepared to make this step because otherwise we would continue to linger on in this complacency which brought us where we are today. In the end, I would mention the relationship with NATO, guided now by the Joint Declaration signed in Warsaw last summer. The relationship should be one of cooperation and not competition. The EU needs to acquire a degree of strategic autonomy, particularly for situations where it might have to rely mainly on herself. Let us not forget that NATO is a collective defence alliance and not a company whose unprofitable branches could be shut down. Born from the lessons of two world wars, built with sacrifice by all the Member States, and meant to defend and promote the values which brought us together in the EU too.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2104, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Federica Mogherini", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission/High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, I would like to thank to Mr Paşcu: I also consider the debate on your report as a so-called ‘Article 36 debate’ since it deals with the implementation of CSDP, and I also just realised for this debate for sure I should be sitting on the other side of the hemicycle; you will forgive me if, for practical reasons, I take the point from this position. Let me thank you very much, Mr Paşcu, for an excellent report, and all the Parliament for the work you are doing on security and defence. I had no doubt this would have been the case. This is one of five reports that have just been published, or are about to be discussed, on security and defence. I take it as a clear sign that the European Parliament fully understands the importance of this moment for our work on security and defence. We truly stand at a crucial juncture in our work towards a European Union of security and defence. But before I begin on content, let me say that I am particularly glad, and proud even, to discuss our common defence just a few hours after the presentation of our sustainable development package. Now you will ask me what for – exactly, because it is not only our work on security and defence that goes forward on the implementation of the global strategy, but it is all the different strands of action that we foresee in the global strategy in an integrated manner that are moving forward on implementation. Also because security in our region depends clearly on sustainable development and also vice-versa. So I would like to underline the fact that the debate we are having on this particular issue does not happen in a vacuum but, on the contrary, in full conjunction and in full coherence with the work that we do on other strands of work. On defence in particular, there is today a momentum for deep and decisive changes. As I was preparing for this debate today I was remembering that, in my hearing in Athens in October 2014, before taking office, we discussed this issue at length and, in particular, I asked my team to print out the minutes of that hearing and I remembered, in particular, a question that Arnaud Danjean asked me at that time and I replied:  Je vais jouer mon rôle de chef de l'Agence européenne de défense, je vais visiter les missions, je vais beaucoup travailler avec les ministres de la défense, parce que dans ce cadre, il est important, bien entendu, de travailler avec nos autres partenaires, notamment l'OTAN mais pas seulement. Cependant, il y a un potentiel dans le traité de Lisbonne qui n'est pas forcément exploité, et je vais voir dans les cinq prochaines années si les conditions politiques pour l'utiliser enfin sont réunies. I think we are actually there. I think that, after two years of my term of office, not necessarily for personal reasons, or in relation to personal skills, but because of political conditions. First of all, because our citizens see security as a top priority, and also because Member States see the need to work seriously on security and defence, I think we are there: at the political juncture where advancing on security and defence is finally possible. As we all know, defence falls primarily within Member States’ competences, and that is why, for each step we take, we receive input from Member States. All proposals are discussed extensively with all 28 Member States. Let me stress this: we are still 28 Member States, and all decisions we take in this field are unanimous decisions, including the one we took last week, and this process led to the Council conclusions adopted last Monday, based on the implementation plan that I presented to Ministers as a concrete follow-up to the EU global strategy. These conclusions formulate the consensus among, as I said, 28 Member States about our joint level of ambition, and open a whole new chapter for our security and defence. I am glad to see, too, that our views are almost identical in all fields. Your report addresses all the critical issues we have been working on and its overall approach matches perfectly with our broader package of proposals concerning European security and defence. The report focuses on a more robust CSDP, on our integrated approach to crises, on our cooperation with NATO and other partners, and on the European defence industry. If you look at the three proposals we are presenting, they are perfectly in line with your recommendations. It is a package, the one we are working on now on security and defence of the European Union – a package including three different sets of proposals, three different pillars. Those are the implementation plan on security and defence, which I presented and which was adopted last week, and also the implementation of the EU-NATO Joint Declaration that we signed in Warsaw, and the Commission Defence Action Plan on our defence industry. So, just to give you a sense of how fast and concretely things are moving: on Monday last week the Foreign Affairs and Defence Ministers together adopted the implementation plan on security and defence. The day after that, on Tuesday last week, we met again with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg to progress cooperation with NATO. We presented a joint set of 40 proposals to turn into concrete actions – the principles of the Warsaw Declaration we signed jointly in July. These two processes are obviously autonomous and independent but running side by side, because we both share the assessment that a stronger Europe makes NATO stronger. It is clear that in practice there is no contradiction between Europe’s strategic autonomy, which we assert, and our commitment to our long-term partners. For NATO members, NATO will remain the cornerstone of collective defence. Strategic autonomy means, first and foremost, the ability to be a reliable partner, to care about our own security at home and in the neighbourhood, to take our fair share of responsibility and to be a genuine security provider. This will also require stronger European defence capabilities, as the report rightly points out, and this need is also addressed by the implementation plan. I will get to that in a minute, but let me first mention the European Defence Action Plan, which will focus on overcoming the current fragmentation of the market and increasing the competitiveness of the European defence industry. Linked to that is the preparatory action for defence research to be launched next year. This can be a real game changer for our industry. The starting point is one of our most successful experiences, the Horizon 2020 research programme, which, to date, covers civilian and dual-use technologies. A continent-wide joint research programme on defence would be a natural extension of Horizon 2020. We have immense potential in terms of joint research programmes on defence, economies of scale and more predictable timeframes for investments. To develop the technologies of the future, it is very clear to all of us, I believe, that we need to start investing now, but a big part of our work can also deliver concrete results in a shorter timeframe, and, with the implementation plan on security and defence, we are moving fast in this field too. So, with last week’s decision – and I am sorry you had to change the report – Member States agreed to raise the level of ambition of our security and defence policies. We have agreed that we need to protect our citizens through our external action. And let me clarify here that this is not about having an Article-5-style approach: as I said, collective defence is not for the European Union, we are not a military alliance, but we need to use our external action and instruments to protect our citizens, including at home. We need to strengthen our neighbours and partners to prevent new conflicts, and we need to respond to crises in an effective manner. So the implementation plan includes 13 concrete proposals to match this new level of ambition that we determined together and agreed upon, as well as a clear timeframe for action. It will now be up to the European Council in December – when I will present this new level of ambition and the various options for putting it concretely on the table – to discuss and agree on the proposals. But let me mention a few of these proposals, as, again, they are perfectly in line with your report. I will mention a few of them, not all of them, but enough to give you a flavour of what we are working on. Firstly, more efficient defence spending. Most of the narrative turns around the need to increase our spending. However, when you look at the numbers, you see that Europeans spend 50% of the United States’ budget on defence, yet in terms of output we achieve 15% compared to what we spend. So we have a budget gap, but we also have an output gap that we have to look at, and here I have proposed a coordinated annual review of defence spending to promote joint programmes among Member States and economies of scale. Secondly, better rapid response. We know well that reacting fast is, at times, the only way to react effectively. Time is not neutral when one is reacting to crises. We already have first-class civilian experts and we need to be able to deploy them quickly, but this is also about our battle groups, which next year will have been in existence for 10 years. The plan proposes the removal of the political, technical and – let me stress – financial obstacles that have so far prevented the battle groups’ deployment, including through modularity. Thirdly, the joint planning and conduct of non-combat missions. Let me delete the word ‘non-combat’, as we do not have combat missions, we have executive and non-executive missions. Anyway, the joint planning and conduct of our missions and operations. The European Union is currently deploying 17 military and civilian operations, but to make them more effective we need to improve the coordination among them. The plan seeks to fill the gaps and to ensure that missions are planned and carried out in a coherent way. This is not about creating big, new operational, SHAPE-style headquarter. That is not what we need today: what we need today is to streamline our current structures and make them work better. We already have headquarters running our missions and operations, so this is not about creating something new: it is about using our resources better in a more effective and efficient manner and, as I said, streamlining and making more operational the coordination of our various missions and operations. The last, though certainly not the least, of these few examples is that of new permanent-structure cooperation. Here again we come to the issue of making full use of the Treaties, as I said two years ago. A single system of permanent-structure cooperation is an option that is there in the Treaties. I suggest that we look into it for those Member States that are willing to undertake higher commitments on security and defence. A single PESCO would be one of the options on which I will work with a view to proposing this to Member States. For all these proposals I am presenting concrete measures, and I would like to stress that this is very concrete and, at the same time, ambitious yet pragmatic work we are doing. It is not strategic thinking – we did that exercise last year. Now it is about turning this vision into action. We are not getting into a revision of the Treaties, which would take years and I am personally not sure it would lead us very far at this moment. We are not working on the creation of an EU army, only to get stuck in a never-ending ideological debate – and, by the way, not even NATO has a NATO army. As all those who deal with defence issues know very well, Member States have one set of forces, which they can use either nationally, in NATO, in the European Union, in the United Nations or in other formations. We have already set up our vision, as I said, with the global strategy: we are now turning the vision into concrete, effective and immediate action, and I would like to stress that this immediate action is being taken together in unity. I see the political will from Member States to do this. I see the will finally to move towards a European Union of security and defence. Our fathers and mothers and grandfathers and grandmothers tried this in the 1950s, and we know how the story ended: the Lisbon Treaty gave us instruments we did not use. Probably, the priority of managing the economic and financial crisis has since distracted us from security issues. I believe that now is the time for us to get serious and work effectively in this direction, and I expect the European Parliament to keep supporting and contributing to this process, as it has been doing, in a very useful manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2105, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Arnaud DANJEAN", "mepid": "96747", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would first like to thank on behalf of the EPP, of which I was the shadow rapporteur, our colleague Paşcu who has produced an excellent report, an annual report - it must be remembered - but which is obviously topical especially today after the decisions that you recalled, Madam High Representative, and which are important. Unfortunately - and I am not speaking for you, Madam High Representative - it took Brexit and the election of Trump so that, in many European countries, we remember that defense and security should be a priority for the Europeans themselves. We could have wished that this awareness came earlier because of the conflicts and crises that surround us and which have such a dangerous impact. But still, better late than never. European defense policy must be ambitious, of course, but it must be realistic, pragmatic, flexible, and I think that you have outlined a certain number of avenues that will have to be implemented. Many things - we have been saying this for years here - are already in the treaty and deserve to be implemented before we create - forgive me the expression - \"new gas factories\". Allow me to recall three points that seem to me to be very important politically. First, a European defense policy must distance itself from two myths, that of the common European army, which does not help to move forward concretely and pragmatically, but also that of competition with NATO, because it is absolutely not what it is. We are talking about complementarity and not competition. Second, the transatlantic link: it is strong, but it is not an eternal achievement. What just happened on the other side of the Atlantic reminds us very well that if we do not take our own safety into our own hands, we risk one day having very bad surprises.We must therefore invest more in our defense and carry out more industrial investments and in truly operational systems.Third, NATO: it remains a major player in our collective security, that is obvious.But in the end, NATO cannot, with its decision-making table on which Mr. Erdoğan and soon Mr. Trump sit, be the security guarantor of Europeans.We need to take charge, and it's time to turn good intentions and good words into concrete action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2106, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Ana GOMES", "mepid": "28306", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Mr President, the report we adopted today on the European Defense Union and this one by Ioan Paşcu, on the Common Security and Defense Policy, complement each other in the face of a challenge that will determine whether the European Union is built or allowed to be destroyed.

Europe must wake up, it must organize.

It takes time to establish a permanent headquarters, as Ms. Mogherini said.

The security and credibility of the West rests on the combined strength of the democracies. We always knew that whoever became the next President of the United States, he or she would have demanded that the Europeans carry more of the defence burden. But I would suggest that this is done by the nations spending more on defence and showing more capability and revitalising the NATO alliance, not creating alternative structures. Unlike the EU, NATO is an intergovernmental organisation. It does not undermine national sovereignty, and above all, it has the enormous advantage of binding the United States to the security of Europe. That is the great combined power that our potential enemies take seriously. Russia would be delighted if Europe was to develop its so-called ‘strategic autonomy’ separated from the United States – I mean, what’s that all about? It is a dangerous fallacy for the European Union to imagine, and I am quoting here from the report, that it can ‘intervene across the whole spectrum of crisis management’ – that includes war fighting, by the way – and that the EU should aim for a ‘common defence’. I thought you said you were not aiming for collective defence – ‘common defence’ is the same thing. Which immediately casts doubt on the continued relevance of NATO.

The consequences are social crash or the fear of it - and the abuse of these problems by right-wing parties and movements. The trumps - and what they are called here - send their regards. This is neither surprising nor by chance. Instead of investing in poverty reduction, advocating for social justice and effectively protecting people fleeing war, poverty and terror, you are wasting tax money on armories and research for war equipment, arming Europe's borders and forcing people into poverty and impoverishment . Linking development aid to the terms of this policy and making deals with governments that do not care about human rights - that is a shame for a Union that invokes its great values. This report and the report on the Defense Union again contain 90% gifts and concessions to the elites, to murderous arms and arms companies. These will be the beneficiaries. But none of these measures will create stability and more real security. There is no alternative. Ms. Thatcher's much-quoted stance on social cuts and poverty also characterizes the stance on the EU military union. There is then no need for any debate.

Today, we have endorsed a report on the Defense Union, and now we are discussing another report that has many similarities. In general, our recent discussions here in Parliament are moving more and more in the direction of our desire to create a common military capability or a common army, and these are wish lists for all kinds of military activities paid for with EU funds. Not least since the Brexit vote, it is as if some in this House have really gained a new hope of being able to deepen cooperation in the field of defense as well. I have absolutely no problem with cooperation but think that cooperation is very good - cooperation and coordination. The world also looks different than it did just ten years ago. Our security situation is also different. We must, of course, adapt to the fact that these are new times and a completely new world we live in. However, this does not mean that I see the same solutions as those in the report, and which I think also go beyond what Mrs Mogherini just said. . For example, I do not believe that the solution is for future security and defense policy to be based on a common territorial defense, including nuclear weapons. Another strange idea is that the EU should be able to enter member states in the event of a riot. I do not think that this is contained in Article 43 of the Treaty of Lisbon, which lists the military activities that are allowed to take place.

It does not go far enough for us on some points - it is Parliament's job to keep pressing.

I also believe that we have to go much further when it comes to research and procurement. These are all ways of saving money, Ms. Lösing. We are spending 200 billion euros with a negative effect! And I believe that we can achieve a great deal more with the same amount of money if we go along these lines. And I believe that in view of the world situation, which you have described positively, but which is realistically there with Mr Putin and with Crimea, and whatever else we could possibly meet with regard to the uncertainty in NATO, it is important is that we make our citizens an offer for internal and external security, as far as we can manage, with all the weaknesses that we have.And this is - it must also be made clear, Mr Hookem - that the NATO Secretary General supported the idea of the European Union at the meeting of defense ministers in Bratislava, because he says that a strong European Union in security and defense policy produces a strong oneNATO.That is why it is in our interest - and we must have our capabilities, in Africa and other places where NATO is not available - that we can fight for our security and for better living conditions, for human rights.I wish you every success on this path and thank you for the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2115, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Afzal KHAN", "mepid": "124962", "text": "   – Mr President, the election of Donald Trump has been a wake-up call for us, even though the US has long urged Europeans to take more responsibility for their own security.

The goal of 2% of GDP, to which NATO allies committed themselves in 2014, has so far been reached by only four Member States. Reports also show how duplication and inefficiency eat into the EUR 200 billion annual defence spend of EU Member States. Lack of interoperability also remains a major problem affecting military cooperation. What we need is a serious effort from Member States to invest more, and more efficiently, in military capabilities. It is time to demonstrate the political will to take action, as opposed to issuing declarations. The implementation plan on security and defence approved last week by all 28 Member States represents an important step forward in European security and defence. We must rethink the EU’s defence role and enhance its capacity to act in the changing global strategic environment.

This is in line with Mr. Trump's commitments, who ultimately advocates a certain withdrawal into itself by the United States and a disengagement, in any case, from the major conflict zones where the United States has worked a lot during these last years.

Because Felipe González already said it: \"Europe will not be Europe until it has a European defense policy.\" In this sense, I wish to tell you that, as a Spaniard and as a European, I know, unfortunately, that democracy sometimes has to be defended with arms. That is why it is even more important at this time that we in Europe take responsibility. However, I have three small - let's say - elements. One is financing - you have been told several times. We would like the funding not to come from somewhere else: from refugees, students or farmers or from cohesion. We therefore need a new, fresh defense budget. And that's where I address Mr Brok and Mr Gahler because in Germany, right now, they are talking about increasing the defense budget to 15%.

As ever, the proposals have been met by some in this House with false accusations that they amount to the creation of an EU army and a concerted effort to undermine the role of NATO. The CSDP has always been rooted in absolute respect for the Member States’ sovereignty in this key area of national policy, and on acknowledging NATO as the mainstay of European defence. The conclusions of the most recent Foreign Affairs Council uphold these key principles. Its support for strengthening Europe’s industrial defence base, eliminating duplication and waste in certain areas of procurement, and exploring the possibility of greater levels of integration militarily for those Member States willing to take such action under the Permanent Structured Cooperation (PESCO) mechanism is to be welcomed, and also respects the principles of sovereignty. The EU NAVFOR Atalanta mission stands out as a strong example of what cooperation at EU level can achieve. Bringing together Member States’ defence capabilities alongside the EU’s unique soft-power and hard-power capabilities, it was able comprehensively to defeat piracy in the Indian Ocean, and, most importantly, NATO welcomed this cooperation. It was, of course, commanded by the Royal Navy, based in my London constituency, but that is an aside.

The complex scenario in our neighboring eastern and southern regions, terrorism, instability in the Middle East, in the Sahel, possible changes, already mentioned, in the foreign and defense policy of the United States, should respond to advances in the European security and defense dimension, which, in addition, Brexit is likely to make less difficult. Those advances require ambition and realism. Ambition, which translates into a significant effort of political will, and realism, which involves being aware of the means available, as well as the current economic and budgetary difficulties.

Due to the nature of modern threats and challenges, security and defense are increasingly interacting with the economies of the Member States and will have a significant impact on the economy.

It is important to keep in mind that the equipment of the security and defense forces of the EU member states is very diverse. Consequently, the abilities are also diverse. In some equipment cases, equipment incompatibility can still be determined. That is why it is necessary and important to work on smarter investment in the defense industry, and especially, as I have already pointed out, dual use technology where, for example, fleets protecting EU borders, including Croatia's on the Adriatic, can focus on equipping, search and rescue, for medical transport operations, prevention of marine pollution, and modular upgrades in a very short time can become combat fleets.

I am entering my seventh hour in this hemicycle today. This is a very important debate so I am glad to hear everyone’s views, but if you take all the catch—the-eyes at the end and all those who come into the room speak, it is not fair – not only for me, because the President changes but I am here for seven hours in a row, but it is also not fair for the following debate, which is a very important one. I apologise, but this might mean that at a certain point in the next debate – which is very important, Mrs Fotyga’s report on EU strategic communication – it will obviously be squeezed a bit. I do not think this is fair to our way of working.  First, I would like to stress the fact that the report is excellent. The work we are doing on the common security and defence policy is not being done, because of the UK referendum. I understand that our friends from the UK might think that everything revolves around this, but the global strategy was prepared and presented during the previous year and presented just the day after the result of the referendum. It has been done and it is work we have to do because it is necessary for the security of our citizens, and, as long as the UK is in the European Union, this work will go on with the 28 all together. It also strikes me a bit that precisely those of our colleagues who have indicated that their country will be leaving the European Union are the ones who feel so strongly about the future of European defence cooperation. I also understand that some would like to stay plugged in – you will sort out amongst yourselves what you want to do in the future, and then we will discuss it together. But the European Union will certainly continue to implement the decisions we have already taken with the 28, as I said – and I am glad about that – on concrete ambitious steps to strengthen the common security and defence policy. It is not about the EU army, and it is not about duplication with NATO. NATO is perfectly happy with what we are doing, because this is also a way of strengthening NATO. We are working—hand—in—hand together. It is not about building new, big headquarters; it is about being effective with the instruments we could have tomorrow if the political will is put in place and the financial resources are dedicated. It is not necessarily about spending more; it is about spending smarter, because in times of budget constraints – and some of you mentioned this – the only way for Europeans to invest smartly in defence is by doing it together. So, as the European Union helps, supports and accompanies Member States in many fields to the advantage of European citizens, from agriculture to infrastructure (I don’t want to go into other issues here), we can do the same on defence and make it more effective, more constructive and easier for Member States to work effectively in defence. No Member State alone – some of you mentioned this – can face security challenges today if not in cooperation, and our security is interconnected. We have seen it in recent months and in the last year and a half. Whenever we face a serious security threat in one of our Member States, all European citizens can be targeted, so we have a collective responsibility to work on our security together.  The integrated approach – soft power and hard power together, the European way – is what will be done more and more, so it is not about choosing hard power versus soft power. The European Union is the only player in the world that can use both hard power and soft power instruments in an integrated manner. Again, NATO is the first to recognise that we have instruments that NATO, as a military alliance, does not have.  I will continue to work in a very committed way, together with Parliament, to advance this agenda in a very pragmatic, but also very ambitious, manner. For me, this is also a test of the Lisbon Treaty. Some say I have two hats, but I actually have three, and I will use the three of them in this work, with the support, I hope, of the European Parliament, as head of the European Defence Agency, Vice—President of the Commission for Commission competences on the industrial and research part of it, and certainly as High Representative and as Chair of the Council, both in the foreign affairs and defence ministers formations.

It was very important for me to monitor the elections in Lebanon in 2005 after the assassination of Rafic Hariri and to see the influence of StratCom at that time. We have, of course, now seen many transformations of the strategic communications and propaganda in these countries. The assignment from the enlarged Bureau of the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) was very clear. I was given the task of describing the hostile propaganda from both state and non-state actors. It was decided that I present in my report, together with my co—workers and experts and after consideration and joint elaboration with excellent shadow rapporteurs from the political groups, the view of two directions from which we are facing hostile propaganda. In terms of the Russian Federation, the situation is somewhat clearer now, because, after the the annexation of Crimea and the aggression by the Russian Federation in the eastern part of Ukraine, many countries in the Western world – Western democracies – are fully aware of the proceedings of disinformation, manipulation and propaganda.

Last week, the Oxford Dictionary named ‘post-truth’ the word of the year 2016. ‘Post-truth’ describes a situation – and I quote from the dictionary – ‘where objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief’. This phenomenon has always existed, for sure, but it has become even more relevant in the age of internet. We know that the quality of the information is not always what makes content go viral. Social media and search engines tend to promote contents that confirm the user’s views instead of challenging them, and we all understand how relevant this can be in political terms, including for our European Union. So I am glad that the report we discussed today has given this Parliament the opportunity to reflect on such a delicate and crucial issue, where not only security has to be taken into account, but also everyone’s freedom of expression. As the report states, exposing this information is an important task and I am glad that the report commends the work carried out by our East Stratcom Task Force. It is clear from the Task Force’s work that the challenge coming from this information is not receding. Let me thank the Parliament for its close interest and support for the work we have been doing with the Task Force over the past year, as well the Member States who have contributed to the team. I can only welcome the proposal that this Parliament this advanced to strengthen both our East and South Task Forces on strategic communication. As I mentioned, both of them – Stratcom East and South. Let me stress that our work on this information is very different and depends on a case-by-case scenario. This information can be contrasted with fact-checking and rational arguments. The propaganda of terrorist groups, like Daesh, needs instead to be confronted first and foremost by taking down illegal content from the internet. To address the issue of the accessibility of terrorist materials, the Commission has established an Internet Referral Unit at Europol that actively scans for terrorist content online and refers it to the internet companies. So far we are still in the initial phase; we have referred over 15 000 pages, and in 90% of cases the material has been removed. Yet we know that this part of our work, however crucial, cannot be enough. What matters even more is to explain what the European Union is doing and how it is making a real and positive difference to the lives of so many people inside and outside the European Union. Now the report tackles with the issue of propaganda by third parties, but let me say that this is an issue that would be interesting to see inside the European Union, starting maybe from this very Hemicycle. We need to give voice to the people who have benefited from our policies, amplify the positive stories, simplify the messages and talk about real life. The truth – to the East, to the South and inside our Union – is that this positive added value of the European Union has to be more visible. This is why we have put public diplomacy among the key areas of implementation of our global strategy. So the East Stratcom Task Force is doing this, providing expert guidance to our delegations; working closely with governments in the Eastern Partnership Region and with the Commission; reaching out to a Russian-speaking audience that want better access to information about the European Union in real time in Russia and from a source they can trust. Similarly, the Task Force South is addressing Arabic-speaking communities in North Africa and in the Middle East together with our delegations. In particular, it is engaging with young people, working closely with the Anna Lindh Foundation, talking to the youth of the region, but also listening to their concerns and their aspirations. Last but not least, we need to engage with civil society, young leaders, independent journalists and NGOs – credible voices that often lack the skills or the financial resources and sometimes the space – the freedom – to express themselves. So our policies are also aimed at improving media plurality, both to the East and to the South, helping journalists get the training, the networks and the quality information they need to do their jobs. Our new young Mediterranean voices, for instance, will twin young journalist with more senior professionals and reach out to the media industry.  So to conclude, in this post-truth era, the European Union must stick to objective facts and at the same time appeal to emotions, personal beliefs and motivations. We have so many stories to tell that are positive. Stories of reform against corruption or innovative start-ups, stories of reconciliation or economic growth, and the future of our Union will also depend on our capacity to tell these stories, explaining the facts and reviving the passion for our European project. We can start in this Parliament.

These activities are clearly visible throughout the Western world: through spreading lies, falsehoods, or manipulating opinions. Of course, there is not just one country that uses these methods. We have just seen this during the election campaign in the USA during these weeks. We see this daily in the reports of the Turkish media loyal to the government. Yet this report focuses on one country, Russia. What I find even more worrying: Despite our fierce resistance, it also includes IS. It certainly uses similar methods, but of course it is not a state, and that is where the big problem lies. Contrary to the well-founded thesis of the EU and many other states, a terrorist organization is raised to the same level as a state. Something that we have been expressly preventing for years, namely viewing ISIS as a state, is being wiped away as a secondary issue in this report. We have crossed a red line. ISIS or IS or Da‘esch is not a state and should never be treated as such. It is undisputed that Russia, by spreading falsehoods, nurturing doubts and many other questionable media activities, both tries to divide the member states and drives a wedge between Europe and the US. We were of the opinion that there are other countries that could have been included in this report, if only to achieve a greater balance. That and the undeniable problem of including the IS here has led to that we will not be able to approve this report tomorrow, but will abstain.At the same time ...

Equally successful, the Kremlin’s propaganda operates in a different way: it tries to reach out to as many people as possible, with as many different stories. It is in the Kremlin’s playbook to deconstruct the truth and to spread the lies around widely – an approach first tested by the Kremlin on its own people, citizens of Russia. It was proven back in Soviet times that the moment the TV set wins over the fridge the regime can start feeling quite secure. To build on that further, however, it has to start gaining minds outside. The EU, the West, and our values have been chosen as a strategic target. Suddenly, Europeans who are used to information being free and based on facts become consumers of fake information and lies. The challenge is how to explain to Europeans that stories such as those of the crucified boy in Ukraine or the girl named Lisa kidnapped and raped in Germany have nothing to do with reality. I am more than convinced that setting up the East StratCom Task Force within the European External Action Service was the right and timely response to those massive campaigns of anti-EU propaganda.

This week, the report we are currently discussing has given rise to a new attack on the European Union, with such media claiming that the European Parliament is preparing a last-minute secret amendment to the report to ban Orthodoxy. These are two classic examples of hybrid information warfare and show why the European Union must counter propaganda, and today's debate is absolutely timely and necessary. I am very sorry to hear from my colleagues in the European Socialists and Democrats that they will abstain. If we are not united on this issue, we will not be effective.

According to the OECD, having a high proportion of adults with low proficiency in basic and digital skills is linked with lower levels of productivity and lower prospects for growth and competitiveness. This is detrimental to the individuals concerned and also costly to the economy and society as a whole. Nevertheless, the development of new ways of working and future—oriented sectors has a key role in relation to the types of skills needed. Skills mismatches and skills shortages can negatively affect not only productivity and growth but also the social situation within and across Member States. The Commission proposal recommended that Member States build on existing initiatives or policies and set up a Skills Guarantee, allowing those who have left the education system without completing upper secondary education or equivalent, and who are not eligible for support under the Youth Guarantee, to access upskilling pathways. Against this background, I have a number of questions for the Commission. The Commission calls on Member States to draw up, within one year of the adoption of the proposal, an action plan for implementation. Has the Commission proposed a mechanism or a body to support them in the preparation and monitoring of this plan? Various stakeholders should be associated in the preparation of the plan: how will Member States be encouraged to involve civil society, education providers, trade unions, employers, businesses and industry in the decision—making process? Does the Commission believe it is possible to cover this initiative without additional funding? The use of different EU funds, like the European Social Fund and Erasmus Plus, has been mentioned. Does the Commission envisage the introduction of appropriate procedures to enable the combination of different funds without creating red tape? What strategy will the Commission use for the involvement of Member States in this non—legally-binding initiative? Lastly, one of the main reasons for illiteracy is school drop-out.

For both economic and social reasons, we urgently need to act. Weak reading and writing is a problem for one fifth of European adults, while another quarter has difficulty with numeracy, and – even in this digital age – up to 40% of adults have low or no digital skills. They are effectively cut off from the digital age, unable to find information online or to buy a train ticket on the web, for example. Because of their low skills levels, their chance to have a job is lowered, their income is lower and their livelihood and health are at risk. This is why we must show our determination to help the most vulnerable in society. They need a strong foundation of basic skills and the opportunity for a true second chance. This is why we propose the Skills Guarantee, a skills guarantee for adults to develop their basic skills and progress towards higher qualifications. At the heart of this initiative is the idea that adults need flexible pathways which allow them to combine learning with their other – sometimes complex – responsibilities.  I welcome the fact that, yesterday, ministers reached a political agreement on the Commission proposal – and this in less than 6 months. I regret, however, that our proposed title has been diluted by the Council, which decided to call this now Upskilling Pathways: New Opportunities for Adults. The core elements of our proposal have been preserved. As you know, these are built on three practical steps and a strong partnership approach.  Turning to the questions you raise on the action plan for the implementation, our original proposal required each Member State to draw up a detailed action plan for implementing the recommendation. During the negotiations in the Council, this was replaced with a more general text, but also invited Member States to outline appropriate measures for implementation at national level by mid-2018 at the latest. I hope that Member States will attach the appropriate importance to its implementation. We stand ready to support them and will take stock of national implementing measures by the end of 2018. The Advisory Committee on Vocational Training will work with the Commission to follow up this initiative, and this tripartite body brings together government and social partners and representatives from all Member States.  Regarding funding, as you know, the provision of basic skills is – and remains – a national competence and should be funded first and foremost by national sources. This should be prioritised in national budgets. The recommendation does not require Member States to start from scratch; our proposal builds on their existing policy and practices. The Commission has made clear from the start that there is no additional EU funding. Nevertheless, considerable EU funds are already available for use by Member States on education and training, employment and social inclusion. We have EUR 27 billion of ESF funding that will be invested in education, training skills and lifelong learning from 2014 to 2020. In addition, EUR 21 billion is available for social inclusion, and EUR 30 billion for sustainable and high-quality employment, which can also support the integration of people with low skills.  I also want to use the opportunity to thank Parliament for having defended so effectively the budget increase of the Erasmus+ programme for 2017, as well as the youth employment initiative. It demonstrates that political priorities are not only based on words: to make a real change, policies need to be transformed into concrete actions and be supported by adequate funding. In fact, most Member States have already prioritised low—skilled adults in their ESF operational programmes, including supporting adult learning in libraries, in community centres, and, among others, on the factory floor.  Regarding the Commission’s strategy to involve Member States, at European level there is already a forum that can follow up the initiative, as mentioned already: the tripartite Advisory Committee on Vocational Training. The adult learning strengths of the Erasmus+ programme will support suitable projects on peer learning between Member States. We will work closely with Member States in supporting as needed ESF interventions targeting low—skilled people. We will also continue through the European semester to emphasise the importance of upskilling and reskilling adults. As you remember, in 2016 not less than 10 Member States received country—specific recommendations in this area. Education, training and skills will continue to be covered in the detailed report on each country and therefore provide a regular opportunity for the Commission to highlight the issues raised by this initiative, whether or not they lead to a country—specific recommendation.  Regarding literacy as a reason for school dropout, this initiative complements the extensive work carried out by the Commission together with Member States and stakeholders to prevent early leaving from education and training. As you know, we aim to reach the European benchmark of 10% or less of early leavers from education and training by 2020. We are already supporting mutual learning among Member States and improving the evidence base, thanks to the expertise of Cedefop and Eurydice.  This new recommendation focuses on addressing the consequences of early leaving by providing a second chance to adults who were failed in previous decades and left school without acquiring a sound level of basic skills or qualifications. This must be part, too, of our shared commitment to fight inequalities in society, to combat poverty and to help break the cycle of inter-generational poverty, including by giving parents opportunities to improve their skills. The adoption by the Council of this recommendation and the agreement reached yesterday is just the first step. Now the main challenge is translating this political commitment and ambition into concrete measures for citizens which make a difference in their lives. We are ready to work together to make this happen.

Large shifts in trade patterns and technology and the increasing sophistication of industry, as well as the overall decline of industrial employment, are having profound effects on Europe’s working population. Jobs, often elementary in nature, are ever fewer, and jobs of low qualification are becoming more and more demanding. With the decline of traditional manufacturing in many places in Europe, low-skilled workers are the ones who tend to lose out. It does not help that more than a quarter of EU citizens aged between 25 and 64 have not gone beyond lower secondary education and, as the OECD survey of adult skills shows, a similar share of people perform at the lowest level in literacy, numeracy and problem-solving skills.  This is why I welcome the Commission initiative on the skills guarantee, because of all the initiatives put forward in the new skills agenda it deals with the most vulnerable people within the labour market, and I believe that, if properly implemented, it could help deal with long-term unemployment too.

Secondly, the Commission must provide good training to Member States' governments in accessing and interconnecting existing European funds.

The Commission proposal considers that something must be done for those with low proficiency in basic skills, literacy and numeracy and digital skills and recommends a set of policies and initiatives to support them. The proposal limits itself, however, to addressing only the effects of a wider problem without questioning why these individuals lack basic skills. Is school drop—out one of the reasons? Is poverty a possible answer? I would welcome more Commission research into the causes of this lack of skills, be they poverty, unsustainability of educational systems or the need for mentality change, rather than seeing that the EU is once again focusing on patching up only the damaging effects of a problem. If this phenomenon is not tackled appropriately, the number of people without basic skills will simply repeat itself.

The skills guarantee, when established, must seek to do that in a holistic manner so that not only do these people develop and hone new skills, but so that they also become critical, confident and independent individuals and achieve their full potential. It is also important that the skills guarantee involves civil society, education providers and trade unions in order for it to be successful, as these are the organisations that know how to reach out to the people who will benefit the most from upskilling pathways.  But to conclude on a slightly less positive note, the skills guarantee comes under the new skills agenda, which is a Commission initiative that seeks to get European educational institutions to do the bidding of private interests, creating insecurity in the labour market while calling it ‘flexibility’, and compromising education systems with demands of private industry interests.

The latter often have gaps in their careers, because they stop to take care of children, young children, disabled children, elderly parents and so what happens? They have a career delay which leads to the impoverishment of women.

Today we are talking about part of the New Skills Agenda, called the Skills Guarantee. I would like to make two comments on this. Firstly, the Commission is making a proposal that is certainly sensible and worthy of support, namely to integrate people with little or no training into the labor market and thus into society. But I find the cost aspect of this proposal problematic. The Commission is making proposals here that others have to pay for, namely the Member States. They have to pay for the proposals and, as is well known, they are subject to agreed spending restrictions, for example through the Growth and Stability Pact. The Commission's proposal only states that the expenditure assumed complies with the Growth and Stability Pact, without any explanation as to how. I would like some information from the Commission on this. I would also like to make another point: we should be more careful about the names we give to our political initiatives. From my point of view, the word guarantee is currently being used inflationarily. We have a youth guarantee, now a competence guarantee, some even demand a child guarantee. From my point of view, such terms arouse too high hopes in the population and create frustration and a tiredness of Europe when we cannot deliver, for example with the competence guarantee. It carries the risk of arousing false hopes.

There is no doubt that there is a profound need to give guarantees to workers and aspiring workers today and the question of the Employment Committee tries to better understand what kind of guarantee the European Commission would have in mind, which ones and how many resources to use to make it work, what strategy to adopt to make it effective and flexible, but also binding in the Union and its Member States.

For this guarantee to be effective, the focus must be on two important elements, from my point of view. First, you have to be able to identify people who do not have the skills and, in this area, many taboos still exist and sometimes people who can neither read nor write prefer to hide it. We must therefore change mentalities and lift inhibitions. It is also necessary to target the most disadvantaged areas and groups.

Commissioner Tibor Navracsics recently took part in a conference on sign languages and human rights, organised by Helga Stevens, which showcased the challenges faced by the deaf and the hard of hearing on a daily basis. The Commission was impressed by the professional competence of the sign language interpreters, who were conveying the speeches in more than 30 sign languages. The Commission welcomes the political groups’ initiatives for a motion for a resolution, because we believe that more should be done to show respect for the deaf and hard of hearing community and its languages. The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union explicitly excludes any form of discrimination, and the Disability Strategy 2010-2020 stresses the principle of social inclusion.  The Commission believes in, and promotes, inclusive education. Whenever possible, schools should open their doors to deaf children, ensuring that the conditions are met for their successful inclusion in the classroom. Sign language interpretation should be provided whenever possible for public services.  Education and language policy falls under the exclusive competence of the Member States. However, the Commission supports them through facilitating cooperation and exchange of best practices. The Erasmus+ programme already funds a number of partnerships and mobility projects that develop open educational resources and train sign language teachers and interpreters. For example, the research project Developing and Documenting Sign Bilingual Best Practice in Schools maps the situation of sign bilingual education in 39 European countries. The European Forum of sign language interpreters provides opportunities for meetings, conferences and exchange of experiences. We also have the toolkit Signs for Handshakes, Deaf—Youth—Meets—Employers, and the European Language Label. More support for sign languages is provided through the research programme Horizon 2020, and there again we have many examples: information technology is used for the early detection of and compensation for hearing impairment, and also to develop applications supporting the use of sign languages, for example. Another example is that a digital archive presenting the life narratives of elderly signers has developed. Remote communication between signing and speaking people through applications that translate text into sign languages is made possible, and another example under Horizon 2020 is an interactive digital atlas of the linguistic structures of the world’s sign languages. As regards the Commission, the Directorate General for Interpretation regularly provides sign language interpretation for EU—level meetings. To support the full participation of those using sign languages, interpreters tailor their services by discussing with participants whether international sign language is appropriate or whether a national sign language is needed.  As you can see, the Commission has come a long way since this House adopted its last resolution on sign language recognition in 1998, but we know we can and should do more to ensure our societies not only tolerate diversity, but also cherish and promote it. The Commission therefore welcomes this resolution, and will continue supporting sign languages, their users and their interpreters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2232, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Ádám KÓSA", "mepid": "96829", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, sign language interpretation is not help, but a fundamental human right to full participation in the community. Accessibility is a precondition for people with disabilities to be able to live independently and participate properly in society. Please note that, at my request, the sign language interpreter did not translate my previous words, so that the Members present could not understand what I was saying. With this, I wanted to make sense of what it means to be unable to use my mother tongue freely and to express my thoughts in this way. Now I will repeat what I said. So, if one falls out of the triad of education, employment and accessibility, the deaf will continue to be disadvantaged. Interpretation and accessibility, as well as accessibility, play a key role in this.

For a long time, sign interpreters were considered to help deaf people. Often the deaf person's family acted as an interpreter, even during official affairs. This is still the case in many countries in the EU, but the situation is improving and sign language interpretation is gradually becoming a fully-fledged profession. This joint resolution is based on previous European Parliament resolutions of 1988 and 1998 and input from deaf and interpreting organizations. It is also a result of the conference I organized in Brussels on September 28, 2016, where for the first time all 24 EU spoken and 31 EU sign languages ​​were used. Sign interpreters are indispensable for ensuring equal participation of sign language users. The Charter of Fundamental Rights does not allow discrimination based on disability. We can only do this by working on accessibility and reasonable adjustments. I am also referring to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which both the EU and most EU Member States have ratified. Everyone in this House knows that interpreters have a demanding job. This certainly also applies to sign language interpreters. Therefore, they deserve appropriate and equal pay for their work. There is still a serious shortage of interpreters in all EU Member States. On average, one sign language interpreter is available for 160 deaf people across the EU. But there are major differences between the different Member States, from one interpreter per eight deaf to one per 2 500. Just imagine. Providing training and education opportunities for future interpreters is an absolute priority. Within the EU institutions, there is an increasing demand for interpreters from deaf citizens. Given that there are not enough interpreters in the Member States, I would like to refer to the Commission ask how she will tackle this problem.Are there any plans to employ sign interpreters, bearing in mind that sign interpreters are also part of the International Association of Conference Interpreters (IACI)?This joint resolution, to be voted on tomorrow, is an important milestone for persons with disabilities and in particular for deaf sign language users.It is the first time that the focus is on sign language interpreters as a professional group.After 20 years, it is high time to take the next step and focus on professionalizing the sign language profession and the EU institutions must play an exemplary role here.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2236, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "(The President speaks without a microphone.) ... tried to convey to Mrs Stevens that she must come to an end, because it does not work with the hammer.But it worked fine.Thank you very much.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2237, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Marian HARKIN", "mepid": "28116", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, I am very pleased to be a co-signatory to this motion on sign languages and professional sign language interpretation.

It is, of course, a follow—on to Helga’s very successful event in the Parliament on sign language, where I had the opportunity to meet a number of Irish people from the deaf community. But tonight, the question is: how can we progress the initiative? One opportunity is the implementation of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, where the Convention elaborates on the need for reasonable accommodation. But we all know that there can be no reasonable accommodation without the provision of qualified and professional sign language interpreters. For this to happen, we need many things, but, crucially, we need to see official recognition of national and regional sign languages in Member States and in the EU institutions. I want to acknowledge the campaign that is underway in Ireland to achieve formal recognition of the Irish sign language. In Ireland, approximately 40 000 people use the Irish sign language, 5000 of whom are deaf and 35 000 are family and friends. At national and EU level, we must make the educational system, the health system, the judicial system, the political system and many other public systems as accessible as possible.

The relationship between the two areas, however, is not unique. It could be argued that the expansion of international trade and growth is one of the causes of global warming. However, it is necessary to recognize globalization the great merit of having favored the diffusion of technologies with low environmental impact and better standards. This is why we believe the green goods agreement that is being negotiated between 17 parties, including the United States and China, as well as the European Union, is so important. The negotiations which, as far as we know, have had alternating phases of speed and success, but which could be concluded in December, have some critical elements. We have therefore put forward this question with which we ask for clarification regarding the Commission's strategy and the Union's offensive and defensive interests in the area of ​​environmental assets. There are two concerns underlying our request. The first, conceptual, concerns the nature of the agreement itself and, in particular, the objective of contributing to the fight against climate change. Indeed, we fear that due to the lack of a definition of \"environmental good\", the agreement could betray the results of the Paris conference. We wonder how the environmental credibility of the agreement can not be compromised by the inclusion of some products that can hardly be classified among those for environmental use or greater energy efficiency. Equally worrying is the choice not to consider the impact of production and the potential double use of the selected items. Increased imports from less heavily regulated countries could lead to higher emissions. In this regard, I would like to remind you that when we talk about dumping we are not referring only to the economic dimension but that we also think the social and environmental consequences. The liberalization of certain products such as bicycles, whose manufacturing process in Europe meets the strictest standards, could paradoxically have a negative ecological impact. A tonne of CO2 emitted in a country with less stringent regulations, as well as equally harmful, is also cheaper. Thinking of articles such as pipes, we ask the Commission how it intends to regulate its possible dual use. A pipe, in fact, could be used both for a water recycling plant and in the construction of an oil pipeline. The second concern is of an economic nature. Europe is a leader in environmental assets. Aware of the uninterrupted growth of the sector and the related employment fallout, we ask ourselves whether the European offensive interests are actually reflected in the agreement. In addition to duties, in fact, the major obstacles encountered by our companies are of a non-tariff nature. We fear that their exclusion could harm our interests. Europe cannot afford to increase its exposure to competition without gaining equal access to foreign markets. Another important exclusion concerns services. For example, the maintenance and repair of a wind farm can reach 40% of the total value of the sale: we therefore ask the Commission how the negotiations for the inclusion of both of these aspects are proceeding. In conclusion, the current state of the environment requires us to take concrete action against climate change. At the same time, this agreement could offer great economic potential for a fast growing sector. We cannot miss the opportunity to demonstrate how trade is also an instrument of sustainable development and can therefore contribute to improving the lives of people and the planet.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2253, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, the Environmental Goods Agreement (EGA) negotiations were launched in July 2014 and are today at a finalisation stage after two years of intense negotiations, comprising 17 rounds of talks involving 44 World Trade Organisation member countries, including the 28 EU Member States. Building on the strong political momentum that was created by G20 leaders in early September, to redouble efforts to find an agreement by the end of this year, we now have a unique window of opportunity to conclude a deal at the ministerial meeting that is scheduled for 3 and 4 December in Geneva. If we do that, we will send out a very strong signal that trade policy can contribute positively to environmental protection and fight against climate change by eliminating tariffs on a list of environmentally sound products. It is doable, but we still have a lot to work to do. So let me address some of the questions you have posed. First you ask whether the Commission can ensure that the EU is conducting these negotiations pursuing primarily environmental-protection objectives and not influenced by specific sectoral interests to reduce tariffs on a certain number of goods. Let me reiterate that the key guiding principle of the EGA negotiation is to eliminate tariffs on a list of goods that are environmentally sound and contribute positively to environmental protection and to fighting climate change. In the years of negotiations, EGA members have closely scrutinised all nominated products from the environmental perspective, with a view to removing those that raised doubts. On the EU side, we have supported products crucial for renewable energy generation, products that are energy efficient due to their particular role with regard to the implementation of the Paris agreement and the shared goal of limiting global warming to 2°. The negotiations also cover imported environmental products to contribute to clean air, soil and water, products that are used for waste management, environmental analysis and monitoring. In this process the negotiators have consulted relevant international organisations such as the United Nations Environmental Programme and the International Renewable Energy Agency and we have, of course, also sought the views of various national environmental agencies, environmental NGOs and industry. Furthermore, customs officials have helped to ensure that the environmental products are clearly defined and can be differentiated from other similar products in the customs nomenclature. Now, let me clarify too that, while environmental aspects are, of course, key in these negotiations, they are also trade negotiations, and these negotiations will be positive for us, especially for SMEs, which will be able internationally to trade environmentally sound products at less cost and with less burdensome procedures. The final agreement will need to be environmentally credible, commercially relevant and balanced so that we can have an acceptable deal for all the parties. Secondly, you asked how the Commission intended to tackle possible market imbalances for those European industries that would continue to face non-tariff barriers when trying to enter foreign markets. Non-tariff barriers and services related to trade in environmental goods do play an important role in the green sector and, on the EU side, we have been vocal on the need to address the market imbalances and to include a work programme to look into this. In the negotiations we, from the EU, strongly advocated a broader agenda but that has not received so much support from other parties. Efforts have now focused on crafting the list of which tariffs will be eliminated, but we have managed to obtain a commitment on a future-oriented agreement that will allow for a work programme, so we can start on non-tariff issues in the future, with a view to identifying non-tariff barriers and also related services in the green sector and consider ways to facilitate trade further. So that is where we are. I hope very much that we can conclude this in a couple of weeks and I am looking forward to the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2254, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Christofer FJELLNER", "mepid": "28126", "text": "for the PPE Group. - Madam President, Commissioner! Abbreviations are controversial in trade policy, we have learned, whether it is Ceta, TTIP, ISDS. Personally, I think that \"USA\" is probably the most controversial abbreviation of all. But the abbreviation EGA - Environmental Goods Agreement - should not be controversial. A green free trade agreement that combines free trade and sustainability should be embraced by all, but there are still threats to it. There are at least two threats that I am worried about. One is traditional protectionism, ie. all those who want to preserve the duties they are now protected by. This applies regardless of whether it is the car industries in Europe that do not want reduced tariffs on electric cars or whether it is train manufacturers who do not want reduced tariffs on trains. Although they occasionally come to me in my role on the Environment Committee and tell me that they are at least the most environmentally friendly in the world and the best in the world, they do everything they can to stay off the list of environmentally friendly products in this context. Or, for that matter, the 22 Member States struggling to maintain tariffs on bicycles, ie the means of transport with zero emissions. That kind of protectionism threatens this agreement. But also the supposedly green ones, those who are looking for the perfect definition of what is an environmentally friendly product, something that is so tight that almost nothing passes through. I think one should have a different definition. I think we should decide that everything that replaces something that we know is harmful to the environment, we should consider greener. Something that can substitute can be a small comparative advantage by lowering tariffs for what is only a little better, then we do something good for the environment. I believe that after Trump and after our own free trade negotiations with Canada, we really need success. This may be the success we need, but it requires that we now actually dare to invest in it in Europe and not let presumably green or for that matter protectionists put sticks in the wheels.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2255, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Inma RODRÍGUEZ-PIÑERO", "mepid": "125043", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, these negotiations were born with very good intentions: to promote trade in goods and services capable of improving the environment and fighting climate change. I am aware of the efforts that the Commission has made, but the truth is that the news and the signals that arrive from the last rounds are very worrying. After two and a half years of negotiations, no agreement has been reached on what is meant by an environmental good, and I wonder how an agreement on environmental goods can be negotiated without reaching an agreement on what these goods are. The list of products has been progressively reduced. Now they are under 300. This list, as you have also pointed out before, is limited to goods and does not include services. Work is being done exclusively on lowering rates and the removal of tariff barriers cannot be incorporated at the moment. And the truth is that the contribution to the protection of the environment of the goods included in the list is being increasingly questioned. I wonder what a release of tariffs on vacuum cleaners or refrigerators, as one of the partners is proposing, could have to do with improving the environment. The truth is that I have the feeling that the negotiations have been abandoning the laudable objective they were pursuing, and that the environmental impact that this agreement seeks to achieve is being reduced to a smaller and smaller expression. I clearly defend that our trade policy is a fundamental instrument to face one of the great challenges we have, which is to combat climate change; but the truth is that the objective and the scope of it have been too decaffeinated.

This agreement can also be an important factor in the European Union's economic growth. We have a high level of expertise in environmentally friendly products in Europe and we are also able to compete globally in this sector. I hope this has not been forgotten, despite the fact that several industries are pushing for just one product. Instead of guaranteeing market access for an individual product, we must prevent market imbalances and ensure that this agreement keeps pace with developments. Here, an effective re-evaluation clause is absolutely essential so that we can ensure that the agreement does not expire in a couple of years. This agreement can also serve as a tool to achieve global goals and is a good indication that trade and environmental friendliness are not mutually exclusive. The negotiations involve major economies and, with this agreement, we can take environmental standards forward at a global level. This objective should not be ignored just because of the speedy conclusion of the negotiations. I look forward to the outcome of the last round of negotiations and I hope that the outcome will be balanced and offer opportunities for environmentally friendly economic growth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2257, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Anne-Marie MINEUR", "mepid": "125037", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - (NL) Mr President, my colleagues Lange and Mosca ask whether the Commission is really pursuing the protection of the environment with this agreement on environmental goods and not the financial interests of certain sectors. They also ask whether this treaty is capable of preventing possible market disruption. Those are valid questions, but why do we still need to ask these questions at this stage? These questions should have been at the beginning of the whole procedure and not at the end. They should have been the alpha and omega of these negotiations. A trade agreement on environmental goods must pursue the protection of the environment. A trade agreement of any kind must ensure that trade between two or more parties leads to fair trade, to mutual benefit, and not to market distortions. If the Commissioner cannot promise that this treaty will live up to expectations on those points, will she submit it to us? Well, at this point we no longer accept just about every product and the list of environmental goods has become a bit shorter, it no longer contains every wild idea. Because how did you come up with putting asbestos on the list? In which world is that good for the environment? But this treaty is again a living treaty, which means that the rules can be changed again. The negotiations were again highly secret and are now again withdrawing from the public domain and from scrutiny. For example, how do we know that biodiesel will not simply be on the list again if we look the other way? Perhaps with the current snapshot of the treaty you are pursuing the protection of the environment, but who guarantees that it will stay that way? Moreover, trade agreements by definition cause damage to the environment. The purpose of free trade is to maximize comparative trade advantage ...

We are trying to show that trade policy can be value—based and that trade policy can make its contribution to the Paris Climate Agreement. It is absolutely unique and something that I think many support. It is good for the environment and it is good also for our green industries. It will not be a perfect agreement – absolutely not – but this is the first time we are trying to do something like this, and we are doing our utmost to ensure that it is environmentally credible and future-oriented. We have 44 countries – 28 EU and the others – and we need to find a balance. We are trying to learn from past successes and failures and base ourselves on the end—use of products that can be agreed by the members. There is no internationally—accepted definition of green goods. I deplore that, and, of course, it would have been much easier if there was. So we are trying to work ourselves through here, with the involvement of all the countries which are there, to try to establish a common determinator to agree on this. It is the first attempt ever in the World Trade Organization (WTO) to cut tariffs on products that contribute to environmental protection and climate mitigation. This will, of course, be a living agreement. We will have a review mechanism where we can add new things to the list and also, as I said, we are pushing very hard to add non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and services, the people who provide the services to these environmental agreements. It is not easy to speculate about the incoming presidential administration in the US. Everybody does that, but nobody really knows. What we do know is that the American current US chair will be at the meeting in Geneva at the beginning of December; we have had confirmation of this. He is very committed to finalising things, and from what we hear this is not something that the President-elect and his administration is opposing either. So we hope very much that we can have the US on board here, and hope also that other big countries, such as China, are willing to grasp this as an historic possibility to break new ground and to do something. It will not be perfect, as I said, but it is a start that we can build upon, and I hope very much for your support on this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2259, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2260, "date": "2016-11-22.json", "name": "Ulrike LUNACEK", "mepid": "97017", "text": "I would like to thank you all for persevering - including the interpreters - and wish you a good night.(The sitting was closed at 11.30 p.
