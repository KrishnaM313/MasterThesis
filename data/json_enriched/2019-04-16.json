I say these words not only as the President of the European Council, but also as a citizen of Gdańsk, 90 per cent destroyed and burnt, and later rebuilt. You will also rebuild your Cathedral. From Strasbourg, the French capital of the European Union, I call on all the 28 Member States to take part in this task.  I know that France could do it alone, but at stake here is something more than just material help. The burning of the Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris has again made us aware that we are bound by something more important and more profound than Treaties. Today we understand better the essence of that which is common, we know how much we can lose. And that we want to defend it – together. Last week the European Council of 27 leaders, in agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom, granted a flexible extension of the Article 50 period until 31 October this year. This extension gives our British friends more time and political space to find a way out of the current situation. I hope that they will use this time in the best possible way. The European Council will be awaiting a clear message from the UK on a way forward. If the Withdrawal Agreement were to be ratified, the extension period will automatically end on the first day of the following month, meaning that the UK would leave the Union on that day. It is clear to everyone that there will be no re-opening of the Withdrawal Agreement. However, to facilitate the ratification process, the EU27 is ready to reconsider the Political Declaration on the future relationship, if the UK position were to evolve. Last week, the European Council changed the logic of granting a much shorter extension than requested by the UK, to giving an extension that is much longer. I proposed such a change, as in my view it has a few advantages. First and foremost, only a long extension ensures that all options remain on the table, such as ratification of the current Withdrawal Agreement, or extra time to rethink Brexit, if that were the wish of the British people. Second, this extension allows the EU to focus on other priorities that are at least as important, like trade with the United States or the new EU leadership. I know that some have expressed fear that the UK might want to disrupt the EU’s functioning during this time. But the EU27 didn’t give in to such fear and scaremongering. In fact, since the very beginning of the Brexit process, the UK has been a constructive and responsible EU Member State. And so we have no reason to believe that this should change. Third, this flexible extension delays the possibility of a no-deal Brexit by over six months. Thanks to this, millions of people and businesses have gained at least some certainty in these unstable times. One of the consequences of our decision is that the UK will hold European elections next month. We should approach this seriously, as UK Members of the European Parliament will be there for several months, maybe longer. They will be full Members of the Parliament, with all their rights and obligations. I am speaking about this today because I have strongly opposed the idea that during this further extension, the UK should be treated as a second-category Member State. No, it cannot. Therefore, I also ask you to reject similar ideas, if they were to be voiced in this House. I know that on both sides of the Channel, everyone, including myself, is exhausted with Brexit, which is completely understandable. However, this is not an excuse to say: “let’s get it over with”, just because we are tired. We must continue to deal with Brexit with an open mind and in a civilised manner. Because whatever happens, we are bound by common fate, and we want to remain friends and close partners in the future. During the European Council one of the leaders warned us not to be dreamers, and that we shouldn’t think that Brexit could be reversed. I didn’t respond at the time, but today, in front of you, I would like to say: at this rather difficult moment in our history, we need the dreamers and dreams. We cannot give in to fatalism. At least I will not stop dreaming about a better and united Europe. Dear friends, this is our last meeting in your current term. I hope to have the opportunity to meet most of you after the elections.

Pour nous tous, Paris n’est pas un endroit neutre, c’est un endroit dont nous aimons toujours retomber amoureux. Le spectacle de cette ville aux prises avec une tragédie qui n’est pas seulement architecturale, mais qui concerne la vie du peuple français, le spectacle de ce monument, Notre-Dame, symbole de la grandeur de la France, comme en témoignent ses nombreux visiteurs au fil du temps, détruit par les flammes, nous fend le cœur. Hier, une partie importante de la France a été profondément touchée par cet événement et nous sommes en quelque sorte tous en deuil aujourd’hui. Je voudrais exprimer à nos amis français toute la sympathie de la Commission, qui s’est d’ailleurs dit prête à soutenir la France dans cette épreuve. L’Europe a été blessée, la France a été blessée, Paris a été blessé, nous avons été blessés et nous sommes solidaires de nos amis français. Since we finished the European Council in the early hours of last Thursday, the Commission and myself, we are on a Brexit break. We are focusing on the very many other issues for our Union. We are focusing on our positive agenda. With that in mind, I want to be very brief. Last week the European Council, in an agreement with the United Kingdom, took a united and responsible decision to grant an extension of the Article 50 period until 31 October this year.  This was an acceptable outcome for three main reasons. First of all, and with the support of this House, we have adopted the necessary contingency measures and we are ready for a no—deal Brexit. But our Union has nothing to gain from great disruption in the United Kingdom. The only ones who would benefit are those who resent multilateralism and seek to undermine the global legal order, and in any case we will never kick out one of our members.  Secondly, we have protected the integrity and the functioning of this House and all our institutions. If the United Kingdom is a Member on 23 May, it must organise European elections. If it does not do so, and the Withdrawal Agreement is not ratified by 22 May, the extension ends on 31 May. This is now the legal situation.  Thirdly, we have made sure that we do not need to discuss Brexit every other week and have given the United Kingdom the time and space to find a way out of the impasse. Once the Withdrawal Agreement is in force, the Commission will work as closely together with Parliament as we did during the entire Brexit negotiations. The full transparency of our negotiations and the close and effective teamwork with the Brexit Steering Group was our strength in the Brexit negotiations and I want to continue this good practice during the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement  Whenever a decision will have to be taken in the so-called joint committee, the Commission will therefore closely involve Parliament and take utmost account of your views. We have learned to pay a lot of attention to the House of Commons over the last months, but let me be very clear, on Brexit nothing can be decided against the views of this House of European democracy. Nothing can be decided on Brexit without taking full account of the position of the European Parliament. Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Der 31. Oktober ist die neue Frist für einen geordneten Ausstieg des Vereinigten Königreichs – oder, sollte das Austrittsabkommen bis dahin nicht vom britischen Parlament ratifiziert werden, für einen harten Brexit, den wir alle vermeiden wollen. Natürlich kann Großbritannien auch entscheiden, sein Austrittsgesuch zurückzuziehen. Das hat der Europäische Gerichtshof ausdrücklich klargestellt. Aber dies ist nicht meine Arbeitshypothese. So wie es auch nicht meine Arbeitshypothese ist, dass wir über den 31. Oktober hinaus die Frist verlängern. Das ist nicht meine Arbeitshypothese.  Im Übrigen mag ich dieses Datum, 31. Oktober, überhaupt nicht. Der 31. Oktober ist mein letzter Arbeitstag als Kommissionspräsident. Es kann also am 31. Oktober keine Nachtsitzung stattfinden, weil ich um zwölf Uhr den Sitzungssaal verlassen werden muss, aber Donald Tusk kann bleiben.  Ich bin Kommissionspräsident geworden, a) weil ich das werden wollte und b) weil ich die europäischen Dinge beschleunigen wollte. Weil ich gerne gehabt hätte, dass wir in Sachen soziales Europa weiterkommen. Wir sind weitergekommen, aber nicht weit genug, weil ich auch die notwendige Reform der Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion zum Abschluss bringen wollte. Weil ich gerne gehabt hätte, dass wir uns in Sachen Finanzierung der nächsten Periode 2021–2028 verständigen können.  Und ich möchte nicht, dass die vielen Forscher, die vielen Jugendlichen, Erasmusstudenten und andere, zum Opfer dieser Brexitgeschichte werden. Sie haben Besseres verdient, und wir müssen dafür sorgen, dass wir sie nicht weiter von Europa entfernen. Die Antwort, welchen Weg Großbritannien einschlagen wird, muss jedenfalls aus London kommen – je früher, desto besser.  Ich begrüße es sehr, dass die Regierung und die Opposition sich jetzt in einem Gesprächsmodus befinden. Das wird als Fortschritt gefeiert – ist im britischen Kontext ja auch ein Fortschritt. Normal ist es aber nicht, dass die tragenden Kräfte so spät zueinander finden. Das ist nicht normal! Und ich begrüße es deshalb, dass diese Gespräche jetzt endlich stattfinden.  Wann die Briten die Europäische Union verlassen, liegt allein in ihrer Hand. Wie die Briten die Europäische Union verlassen, darauf haben wir uns im November 2018 in Form des Austrittsabkommens mit der britischen Regierung verständigt. Dieses Verhandlungsergebnis gilt auch weiterhin. Zu keinem Zeitpunkt werden Nachverhandlungen über das Austrittsabkommen stattfinden. Über die politische Erklärung zur Zukunft der Europäischen Union können wir reden, wenn dieser Wunsch besteht.  Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, le Brexit n’est pas l’avenir de l’Union européenne. L’avenir de notre Union va bien au-delà du Brexit, qui ne doit pas et ne peut pas entraver nos travaux sur nos grandes priorités. C’est la raison pour laquelle le Conseil européen s’est mis d’accord sur deux principes. Premièrement, tant que le Royaume-Uni sera membre de l’Union européenne, nous comptons sur une coopération constructive, responsable et loyale. C’est un principe directeur du traité qu’il faudra que nous respections. We do not only respect; we are requesting that there will be a loyal and responsible cooperation. Deuxièmement, il n’y a pas d’État membre de second rang, mais si un État membre souhaite quitter l’Union européenne, les 27 autres doivent avoir le droit de se réunir séparément pour aborder les questions futures. Ce n’est pas une nouveauté. En décembre 1997, lorsque j’étais président du Conseil européen, j’ai lancé l’Eurogroupe – contre l’avis des Britanniques, des Danois, des Suédois et de quelques autres. Cet Eurogroupe, ce groupe restreint composé de ceux qui se sentent concernés et qui sont concernés par la construction monétaire de l’Europe, avait le droit de se réunir. Il s’est réuni et les résultats ont été appréciables. L’Union européenne a devant elle des défis stratégiques auxquels elle doit répondre. Tout d’abord, nous discuterons à Sibiu, en mai, de l’orientation stratégique de l’Union européenne pour les années à venir. Ensuite, il y a le prochain budget pluriannuel dont nous devons, en principe, décider en octobre. Il y a par ailleurs l’élection des futurs dirigeants de l’Union européenne. Après le Parlement européen, élu par le plus grand corps électoral après celui de l’Inde, nous devrons élire un nouveau président de la Commission et le Conseil européen devra nommer un nouveau président du Conseil. L’avenir de notre Union, c’est notre place dans le monde, ce sont nos accords commerciaux, nos relations avec nos grands partenaires internationaux, notamment la Chine, avec laquelle nous avons eu la semaine dernière un sommet très constructif. En juin prochain, il y aura le G20 à Osaka, où nous parlerons notamment de l’avenir du commerce mondial. Tout cela, à vrai dire, est plus important que les péripéties autour du Brexit. L’Europe continue. (Applaudissements) Commission Declaration for the European Parliament plenary (in writing) The Commission recalls its commitment to ensure that the European Parliament is immediately and fully informed, in line with Article 218(10) TFEU, in relation to the work of the Joint Committee and the specialised committees established by the Agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community (“the Withdrawal Agreement”). For the European Parliament to be in a position to exercise fully its institutional prerogatives throughout the process in accordance with the Treaties, the Commission will ensure that the Parliament receives sufficient and timely information ahead and after the meetings of the Joint Committee or the specialised committees of the Withdrawal Agreement. Moreover, the Commission considers that given the exceptional nature of the Withdrawal Agreement based on Article 50 TEU, an adequate involvement of the European Parliament is necessary in case the Joint Committee would envisage to adopt any of the following decisions: - the decision to extend the transition period in accordance with Article 132 of the Withdrawal Agreement, including the determination of the financial contribution referred therein, - the decision referred to in Article 159(3) of the Withdrawal Agreement relating to the abolition of the United Kingdom independent authority monitoring the implementation and application of Part Two of the Withdrawal Agreement on citizens’ rights; - a decision referred to in Article 20 of the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland that the Protocol in whole or in part shall cease to apply. Therefore, in relation to these decisions, the Commission will inform sufficiently in advance the European Parliament of its intention to present a proposal for a decision on the position to take in the Joint Committee, and of the gist of its envisaged proposal. The Commission will take utmost account of possible comments of the European Parliament in that respect. It commits, in case it does not follow EP position, to explain the reasons for which it did not. The Commission understands that, in view of the short time frame available, the matter will be handled in the European Parliament as a matter of urgency. The Commission will, thereafter, transmit its proposal to the European Parliament for information at the same time as it transmits it to the Council for adoption in accordance with Article 218(9) TFEU. The Commission recalls that these practical arrangements have to be seen in the context of the exceptional nature of an agreement based on Article 50 TEU and do not constitute a precedent for any other agreements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "I want to remind my colleagues that during the Council meeting I insisted on the dignity of Parliament, on the role that our Parliament has, it cannot be used like a taxi, so the role of our institution must also be taken into account throughout the Brexit negotiation..This is a priority for us, I believe I can speak on behalf of all colleagues, we are the first institution of the Treaty and we expect to be respected by all 28 Member States.Thank you, the word on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party to the Hon.González Pons.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Esteban GONZÁLEZ PONS", "mepid": "125027", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I have to talk about the pain I felt yesterday watching the Notre-Dame Cathedral burn. The Notre-Dame fire hurt us Europeans as if we were all French: we all feel the same desolation, we all feel equally helpless and, this morning, we all want to join in the reconstruction. Peoples do not grow up crying together, but moving forward together. That is why yesterday's Notre-Dame fire makes us more European not because we cried together, but because together we are going to rebuild the cathedral. The European Union should commit itself today to provide financial aid and craftsmen - all who are necessary - to rebuild the cathedral as cathedrals were built in the past, joining everyone in the project. The Notre-Dame fire reminds us that Europeans are never alone. Europe is the answer to fire, destruction, selfishness and poverty. So last night, watching the cathedral burn, I asked myself once more: \"But why do the British want to leave here?\" The European Union is a community of principles and values. If you think that it doesn't work, you reform them and you try to fix them, but you don't leave. You do not leave because values ​​do not stop being shared and because they are never negotiated. Whatever happens, there are three lessons we have learned from Brexit: first, in politics you cannot promise what you cannot deliver; second, in politics lies always bring disappointment; and third, the bonds that history forges cannot be broken out of economic selfishness. Nobody wants a hard Brexit, but worse is an indefinite and undated Brexit. For me, Europe is incomplete without the UK, but if British politicians are unable to find a solution, give the people a voice. The Notre-Dame fire also shows us that we talk too much about Brexit and too little about everything else. I am sorry for the vanity of British politicians, but today my pain over the Notre-Dame fire makes me more European than my outrage at their incompetence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Udo BULLMANN", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, this morning we stand united when we look at Paris. We rightly say that Notre—Dame is our case. We rightly say ‘Paris, you are not alone. The French nation is not alone’. This is our manifestation of European solidarity.  In this spirit of European solidarity, I have to applaud President Tusk. You took the responsibility of granting the United Kingdom this extension because, by doing so, you avoided a cliff—edge crash. Who would have paid the price of the cliff edge crashing? Who would have paid the price? Not the liars, not the ideologists, not those with the false promises. Ordinary citizens in the UK would have paid the price, citizens who have to rely on a decent job in this interwoven economy, which is more interwoven than it has ever been before in the single market. Those responsible know this exactly. They were playing with the fate of the citizens in their country. This is wrong and this was avoided by President Juncker and President Tusk, by the European Council, by responsible decision makers, and this is a good signal.  President Tusk, I also applaud you for what you were saying about the rights of Member States as long as they are members. This is all the more true for the rights of the representatives in this House. This is not a party politics issue. This is an issue of the decency of our constituencies and the decency of our democratic processes. We will of course welcome our representatives from the United Kingdom, and of course they will have the same rights as everybody else here in this House. My party and group will protect that, in any case, in each and every situation. Ich bin davon überzeugt, dass wir auch nach dem 23. Mai im Vereinigten Königreich eine neue Diskussion haben werden. Es wird der Anfang vom Ende des Brexit sein, davon bin ich überzeugt, denn endlich werden die Menschen in Großbritannien auch die Chance haben, sich zu diesem Vorgang zu äußern. Denn wir sind nach wie vor in der Situation, dass das Parlament blockiert ist. Ich war immer der Auffassung, dass man in einer solchen Situation die Menschen fragen muss, wenn der Preis für den falschen Schritt klar auf dem Tisch ist, was sie am Ende des Tages davon halten. „Taking back control“ heißt, die Menschen fragen, nicht die Ideologen fragen. Machen Sie sich das bitte immer wieder klar! Ich bin der Überzeugung, dass es hier um mehr geht. Brexit geht nicht nur um Großbritannien, Brexit geht nicht nur um die anderen, die in der Europäischen Union bleiben wollen. Brexit geht um sehr viel mehr. Es ist die Frage, ob die Putins und Trumps, die Steve Bannons und die Salvinis das kaputtmachen können, was von Robert Schuman und Jean Monnet, von Konrad Adenauer und Willy Brandt aufgebaut worden ist – darum geht es im Eigentlichen. Und deswegen werden wir diese Europäische Union verteidigen, weil sie die richtige Antwort auf die großen Zukunftsfragen ist. Meine Fraktion steht dazu bereit. Sie sehen in Finnland, Sie sehen in Schweden, dass wir diejenigen sind, die Europa zusammenhalten, wenn die Rechtsradikalen dagegen trommeln. Ich wünschte mir Partner, die das auch tun. Die Europäische Volkspartei muss beantworten, wo sie in Andalusien steht, wo sie steht bei den nächsten Regional- und Lokalwahlen in Italien, ob bei den Europäern oder bei denen, die Europa zerschlagen wollen.

Personally, 25 years ago my wife studied in France and she worked in Paris for a while and we used to go to Notre-Dame. It’s an iconic building and we were only there last month and we took photographs of it, bringing back fond memories. Think of the millions of people over the years who have stood and watched that building, whatever their faith, looked at it and it’s been a symbol not only of Paris but of the history of Europe, but also the whole feeling it gives. And even though it’s a building not of my faith, I share the pain of many of you in this Chamber today and I hope that we can all come together, whether British, European or from outside Europe, come together and do our bit in that rebuilding. Many of us had hoped that we wouldn’t be having this debate today and that the UK would have left the EU on 29 March, or even last week, but we have to deal with life as it is. The British Government is still committed to delivering Brexit in an orderly way ... (Laughter) ... and leaving the European Union as soon as possible, so that the people in the UK and the EU can focus on the future, or what Jean—Claude Juncker referred to as a ‘positive agenda’.  However, I realise that your patience has worn thin and that you look and wonder what is happening in Westminster. But EU membership has been a divisive issue in our country for many years, not just in my party but in the main opposition party too, and you can see these divisions playing out, and I know many people here will ask: well, why didn’t you begin cross-party talks sooner? And while that may seem natural to most people in this Chamber, this is not how the UK system of parliamentary democracy works.  You only have to look at the House of Commons, where the two parties sit opposite each other rather than side by side as in this Parliament. On one side sits the government, on the other the opposition, and rather than seeking to build coalitions across, it’s a much more adversarial style of politics. So the current talks are naturally uncomfortable for members of both main parties, myself included.  The Article 50 extension agreed at last week’s Council may not have been the answer everyone, or perhaps anyone, wanted, but it gives us more time to pursue all the options in search of a breakthrough and I hope that my colleagues in Westminster do not take too long. Our economy, our politics and our country need certainty and we must aim to find a solution in time to avoid participating in the European elections. The time has now come for pragmatism. Let’s get it done. I’d like to thank Mr Tusk for his more constructive approach last week compared to, say, some of his more recent statements. I think, Mr Tusk, that your words in advance of the Council struck the right chord, that this shouldn’t be about recriminations or humiliations, and that to remain friends and move forward we have to build a future partnership that can truly stand the test of time.  As a country the UK has been in difficult positions before, but we have a reputation for seeing things through and I believe that this time will be no different.  I just wonder if I could end on a personal note. This may be my last speech from this seat or in this Chamber after nearly 14 years and can I just say to my colleagues that whether we have agreed or disagreed over the years, whether you are re-elected or moving on to new challenges, can I thank you all for your service. Can I thank you all for being part of this amazing experience and can I wish you all the very best for the future.

Je suis sûr qu’ensemble nous allons faire renaître Notre-Dame de Paris. Elle rayonnera à nouveau, plus belle encore que par le passé, cette Notre-Dame de Paris, qui est Notre-Dame de France, Notre-Dame d’Europe; j’en suis sûr.  I know that this Parliament has, in fact, no say in the decision that you made on Wednesday, but nevertheless, I want to warn you for one thing and that is for the consequences of the decision of last week, because, until now, we kept the unity in the European Union – the unity among the 27 Member States, but also the unity between the three institutions, the Council, the Parliament and the Commission, and unity built around our negotiator, I want to recall that here today, Mr Michel Barnier, who I want to applaud here for all the work he has done.  (Applause) This unity, in my opinion, Mr Tusk, I have to tell you that very frankly, is at risk now. Instead of sending Mrs May back to London with no extension at all, or maybe with an ultimately very short one – a few days, a week – you gave her six months. But six months, everybody knows that 31 October is in fact too near for a substantial rethink of Brexit, and at the same time, too far away to prompt any action. That’s the problem with the decision that has been taken. I would not go so far as Mr Coburn here who would call it rubbish and because he calls everything rubbish in Parliament, but I fear that it will continue the uncertainty. I fear that it will prolong the indecision, and I fear most of all that it will import the Brexit mess into the European Union. And, moreover, that it will poison the upcoming European election. Moreover, my fear is that it will make from this Parliament that we say that in Dutch, I don’t know if you have that expression, a pigeon house – a dovecoat – the British Members flying in, the British Members flying out, and at the same time, waiting on the substitute benches, a number of Members of 14 other European countries. Banksy, colleagues, has already done a work on this. He painted the house in Westminster as a house a full of monkeys. He could be inspired to maybe make a second work, to paint this Hemicycle in Strasbourg full of pigeons.  My fear, Mr Tusk, is that, with this decision, the pressure to come to a cross–party agreement, as Mr Kamall has talked about, disappears, as we (inaudible) the last days and that both parties, Conservatives and Labour, will again do what they did already for months – run down the clock – and the proof of this is, was that the first decision the House of Commons have taken after your decision was to go on holidays.  So really – and I never thought I should say that in my life here in this Parliament – but maybe the only thing that can save us now is Nigel Farage. Why? As you will hear today, he’s already campaigning. He’s already rallying with a new party, the Brexit Party, catching up with the Conservatives in the polls and the old parties, Labour and the Conservatives risk to be wiped out during the European election. My advice to you Mr Corbett is that, if they are not stupid, both parties should make a cross-party deal now, immediately, in the coming days, to avoid this imminent disaster.  Finally, Mr Tusk, in the aftermath of the decision, you said something and you have repeated it a few moments ago, you said we may avoid Britain leaving the EU, and I’m against Brexit and leaving the EU, but it’s not our decision. It was a decision of the British people. So what my fear is that instead of killing Brexit, the decision could risk killing Europe. At least bogging it down again for years, putting our energy in negotiations with British leaders like Mr Corbyn or Mr Johnson, who, in fact, in their hearts, despise Europe, and this at the moment when we need all our energy, to put all our energy in the reform, in the renewal of our European Union. That is what we, and you also, should solely focus on as President of the European Council. And that spirit was, in my opinion, absent last week, Wednesday.

I think there are moments when election campaign disputes should simply be stopped for a moment. The fire yesterday in Paris showed us how vulnerable our world, how vulnerable Europe, how vulnerable culture, history and also our future are. That is more than what we sometimes carry out among ourselves here. Notre-Dame is a symbol - a symbol of Europe, a symbol of France. As an East German, I decided many years ago to learn French - 45 years ago - precisely because I suspected that I might never have the opportunity to come to Paris and see Notre-Dame. It’s a shock to me. I would like to say to all French colleagues here in Parliament - regardless of the political groups - that we stand closely with them and that we also demand - demand that we be aware of this vulnerability, including the vulnerability of the European Union. It has something to do with what we are now discussing. I do not agree with it at all and am not at all happy about the outcome of the last summit - I find it fatal. I find it fatal because I also agree: Either we'll get a decision - for or against, to leave or not to leave. But six months mean: you are putting this European Parliament and, above all, the democratic process of the European elections at risk. It didn't play a role in your decisions at all, absolutely nothing. When the new parliament is constituted on July 2nd, the summer break will begin. In September the constitution of parliament essentially begins, the working capacity. Yes, we want to give full rights to all British colleagues who are then in Parliament. Does that mean we have to do a plan B from the start, we have to double the commissions? Because it could be, a month after the ability to work is restored, everyone goes out again, then others come after, then the composition of the parliamentary groups changes. Have you ever thought about that? Have you thought about how we should inspire people to go to the European elections - and that is difficult enough in any country - when we simply know in advance that it is a circus that we are pulling out of here?

For me it’s …  (Applause) ... absolutely wonderful to be able to see through the mandate that I was given by the people of South-West England and Gibraltar in 2014. I’m equally delighted that the UK will be holding European elections in May and the Greens are going to use these democratic and proportional elections as a celebration of the values of the European Union. We will mobilise one of the most powerful pro-European forces in our continent and we will champion a fairer, greener, and more democratic EU.  I’d like to thank the Council, and particularly President Tusk, for allowing us the breathing space to reconsider our vote to leave the EU. Building Europe has never been easy and he has shown the vision of the founding fathers, who persevered in difficult times to welcome and even include those countries which were having difficulties at home, perhaps particularly those countries. As a Green MEP I’ve always been tough on Brexit but we also need to be tough on the causes of Brexit. We must address the issues that gave rise to feelings of powerlessness, of alienation, of being left behind, that prompted so many of our fellow citizens to vote to leave in 2016. So I wish my colleagues happy campaigns. Let’s share a message of hope about the positive change that the European Parliament can bring to their lives. Let’s resist the siren song of the far right with its politics of division, hate and fear. In Britain, a strong pro-European vote across the country will massively increase the chances of winning a future people’s vote and convincing our fellow citizens that our best future is as part of the European family.

Little did I realise what the UK political class would do, so the morning message is: I’m coming back. In fact lots and lots of us are coming back because Mr Verhofstadt is right. Yes, I said that. First time ever! You’re quite right, the Brexit party will sweep the board in these elections and there is only one way it can be stopped and that is if the governing party of Ms May and the opposition of Mr Corbyn come together and agree to a permanent customs union and indeed effectively membership of the single market.  If that happens, the Brexit party won’t win the European elections but it will win the general election ... (Applause from certain quarters) ... because the betrayal will be so complete and utter.  So I don’t believe it’s going to happen, and in 15 years as a joint or sole president of a group, I have been to dozens of European summits and again and again I’ve seen conflict between nation states and the European institutions, whether it was the Austrians, or the Irish, or the Hungarians, or indeed the Greeks. And there is one golden rule, always, and that is that Brussels wins. The power and might of Brussels always wins.  But I’ve never been to a European summit quite like last week, where for the second time in two weeks a British prime minister comes along and begs, begs for an extension to Article 50. It was humiliating, not just to be in Brussels, but humiliating for the standing of our country around the world. You know, the Commonwealth, America, many of these countries that actually like us, still believe that we are a great nation and yet we have sunk to this: a Prime Minister that promised us we’d leave on 29 March, that then said we might leave on 12 April, that we would definitely leave on 30 June, and now we’re being told we’ll leave on 31 October.  Halloween trick or treaty, make your minds up and if it’s your last day, Mr Juncker, well I hope that we leave together on that day. But actually, if it’s left to this appalling Prime Minister, if it’s left to our politicians in Parliament, I know that it’s not going to happen. In the past, I know I’ve always criticised the power without accountability of senior bureaucrats in Brussels, but for once I have to say that this mess is not your fault. Your position has been clear from the start. The mess is the fault of British politics, of two parties which both promised us in their manifestos they would deliver Brexit, which signed up to Article 50, which expressly said we would leave with or without a deal.  That is where the betrayal is and I do share Members’ great sadness about the appalling tragedy of Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris being burnt down yesterday – something very beautiful has been lost – but something very vital is being lost in the United Kingdom and I thought the deaths column of The Times newspaper yesterday summed it up rather well: ‘UK Democracy, on 29th March 2019, aged 312. It was with sad regret that Democracy died quietly in her sleep at 11pm, on the 29th March 2019. The cause of death was by foul play and the culprits have yet to be brought to justice. Democracy campaigned for the rule of law, human rights [...] and [always] favoured the majority in all her decisions. She will be sorely missed. God have mercy on [our] soul.’  What is happening in British politics, beginning on 23 May isn’t now just about Brexit, isn’t now just about us leaving the European Union. It’s about what kind of country we are. We have the oldest, longest serving continuous parliament in the world. The mother of parliaments. We have fought and given much for that principle of nation state democracy, not just for us but for our friends in Europe too.  I sense among some in my country disillusionment. But in others I sense a burning anger. Not one to put on yellow vests and protest, but one that says we need a peaceful political revolution in our country. We need to sweep away the two—party system that has let us down so badly, and I think you’re all going to be very surprised by what happens on 23 May. It will be a new future for British democracy and goodness me, it’s needed.

Instead, the democratic decision of 17.4 million people is being deliberately and cynically betrayed. The European elections in May will inevitably be a re-run of the referendum question. Whatever the political parties say, the voters’ choice will boil down to voting ‘do we remain in the European Union’ or ‘do we leave the European Union’. The Remainers should vote for the Liberal Democrats. They are the true party of Remain. Leavers should vote for the UK Independence party; UKIP is the true party of Leave. Voting Conservative or Labour is truly a wasted vote because nobody, including them, actually knows where they stand on this issue. UKIP’s policy is clear and straightforward. It is one of unilateral and unconditional withdrawal. But these elections will divide people into two distinct groups, not just in the UK but across Europe. One group will be those who consent to be governed by a foreign power: The European Union. The second group will be those who vote to rebel against further EU integration and in favour of returning democratic powers to the nation state. One group will be voting for freedom and independence. The other group will be voting for subservience and submission. One thing that we can be sure of is that Eurosceptic MEPs will return in big numbers and their voters will be voting for a return to democratic accountability, an end to austerity measures and for their economies to be run in their interests and for their benefit. They will be voting to end mass uncontrolled immigration. They will be voting for parties that want to preserve their cultures and their civilisation. There will be a great populist vote across Europe. In the United Kingdom we have the simplest choice: vote to remain or vote to leave. It was the electoral threat of the UK Independence Party that brought about the referendum in the first place, and UKIP will continue to fight to make Brexit happen.  UKIP MEPs elected on the 23 May will continue the political struggle to set Britain free from the European Union, and a vote for UKIP on 23 May will send a clear message to Her Majesty’s Government: leave on WTO terms immediately. UKIP does not just campaign for Brexit; we actually want to make it happen. A vote for UKIP is always a vote to leave the European Union and the British public should vote UKIP on 23 May.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "EFD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 14, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Kazimierz Michał UJAZDOWSKI", "mepid": "23791", "text": "- Madam President!

We need in this House the ability to move forward with the great tasks of the future, with the questions we are asking ourselves - from migration to trade wars, questions of internal and external security, questions to do with climate change and some other. We must make it clear that the European Union is the only force to work together in the distribution of this world that the Trumps and Xis and Putins operate to save Europe, to move us forward, to make ourselves stand out as our own strength, and not the fragmentation of it Nationalism, which has been preached here again by some of the speakers. This Europe stands for solidarity, for peace and freedom, for humanity, for economic success. And I think this Europe has done this in an excellent way so far. This is my last speech in this House today - after 39 years - and I would like to say that this Europe is a success story.

That’s very true, and that’s why I was so shocked when you said that, that Mr Farage – who’s no longer with us, as usual – shouted out ‘rubbish’. I think that illustrates the attitude of some of those on that side of the House. But they are the voices of the past. The British people are beginning to see through the lies that they have told for years about the European Union. They’re beginning to see through the lies they have told about Brexit. Remember they told us it would be easy; well it’s turning out to be pretty complicated. They told us it would save lots of money that would all go to the National Health Service; it’s turning out to cost a fortune. They said there would be new trade deals ready with countries across the planet to replace any lost trade with Europe; in fact we’re losing all the trade deals we have via the European Union if we go ahead with Brexit. The British people are beginning to see through that, and that is why they are so afraid of having another referendum, because they know what the answer would be if we had one. (Applause) And that’s also why the Conservatives are (inaudible passage) European elections, because they know they would be hammered in those elections. I’m a bit surprised that Mr Verhofstadt and some others in this House were afraid of those elections. There’s no need to be afraid. The majority of British Members being returned will not be of the ilk of those on that side of the House. (Mixed reactions) And in any case, Brexit – the European Union losing a Member State for the first time in its history – the consequences of that decision are far more significant than the inconvenience of one Group having a few more Members than another Group in these elections. Have a sense of perspective. (Applause) This extension must be used, as Mr Tusk rightly said. I have no great hopes for the talks between the two front benches, because Mrs May cannot move position without a rebellion in her party. But it does give us the time to go back to the people and end this damned mess that we have got ourselves into.

The latest development in kicking the can down the road as far as possible just happened last week. Yes, the extension gives the opportunity to really address the real problem and you’ll not be surprised, Mr Barnier, I still consider that problem to be the backstop. I’ll not change that. It has haunted these negotiations since the beginning and will continue to do so as long as you retain your position. I have to say, the extension to October, I can see no agreement at the end of that time. I really believe now it will take a new Commission. It will take a new Parliament. It will take new views to bring an answer to the end of this problem. My view has always been simply, if you’re part of a club, you should be in the club. They cannot be half in the club or half out of it and that is the trouble where the UK found itself. If I may – Mr Brok has gone – this will be my last speech, not maybe, will be my last speech in this Parliament after 30 years and I want to take the opportunity to say that it has been a great pleasure and honour to represent the people of Northern Ireland in this House for 30 years. There have been some good times and some extremely sad times where we have been through some of the most terrible terrorism ever faced in any part of Europe, and I had to go through that. But it was this House, it was Jacques Delors who stood by the people of Northern Ireland when he brought about – and when Ian Paisley and John Hume and I went to see him back in 1994 at the beginning of the peace process – he asked us, how can Europe help you? And Europe did, with over 2 billion extra funds that touched many people up and down the length and breadth of Northern Ireland.  So, as I say farewell to this Parliament today, I can say I have enjoyed myself. I hope I have given it something and I hope I have represented my people well during my time here because they are a proud people, they are a great people, the people of Northern Ireland.

That is definitely the situation in my country in relation to businesses affected by Brexit and, for instance, farmers who are taking EUR 100—200 less per animal now than they were last year directly because of the uncertainty of Brexit. So hopefully, Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn can come to an agreement, but that seems to be doubtful. If they don’t, a decisive decision has to be made to postpone Brexit indefinitely. We have to retain certainty. It is also affecting my constituency. We were to elect five Members of the European Parliament, but it now seems that we are electing four.

It’s our own fault, because I asked two years ago that we shouldn’t distribute any seats until the British had left, because it was discourteous to them and also there was a possibility – remote, as it seemed – that they might not go on 29 March. My words have come to pass, so now we are in a bit of a mess.

I will begin by highlighting the political importance of this Directive at this time. This directive is part of the development of the social pillar that this Parliament will always have the honor of having proclaimed in Gothenburg last year. It is a first step - I would say a giant one - for the practical and concrete implementation of the rights that are included in the social pillar and, in that sense, it is a Directive that affects all workers in the European Union and, therefore , to all citizens who are generally either preparing for work or working - if they can - or enjoying the rights they acquired while working. Therefore, it affects five hundred million European citizens who are called to the polls within a month. Hence also the importance of this legislature approving this balancing directive, which has had to be found between all forces. This directive - let me be very clear - what it does is establish equal 'minimum rights' for all workers in Europe: 'minimum rights'. It does not establish laws, it does not establish methods, it does not establish application details, because that is what the Member States will do. Let me be very clear: there is no interference in the principle of subsidiarity; what it establishes are \"rights\" and \"minimums\" so that in Europe it is possible to speak of a social Europe in which to develop professional life. Its content is what I can least dwell on because it is what you know and have read the most: there are much, much improved information rights compared to the 1991 Directive; there are rights of non-abuse, of non-abuse of trial periods; and training rights, which are absolutely universal in Europe from now on or from when it is transposed, but which are already a reference. And the great contribution of this text: substantive rights are given particularly aimed at all new forms of contracting —on demand, platforms, what is called precarious work, whatever you want. All these workers, who are now in a kind of limbo that deprives them of their rights, from now on will have the reference of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the reference of this Directive so that no one can abuse or overexploit the indispensable flexibility that is recognized. This Directive is also important in the case of the level playing field - something that is not noticed or that is not said so much -, that is, it ensures that this famous specter of social dumping will never be done at the cost of a minimum quality of workers' lives, since this will be the same throughout Europe. Please bear in mind that we are building Europe - which yesterday suffered regrettable destruction - and specifically social Europe. Many thanks to everyone who has helped me in this work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 41, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I am very happy to be here with you before the vote on this directive, one of the key deliverables of the European pillar of social rights. I would like to thank the rapporteur Mr Calvet Chambon, for bringing this file to a swift and successful conclusion.  We have been under considerable time constraints to close this file during the current parliamentary term. Reaching a provisional agreement would not have been possible without goodwill and cooperation both from Parliament and the Council and not without the rapporteur’s tireless commitment to seek a good compromise text during the negotiations.  The proposed directive is a significant achievement for social Europe. With the directive we will provide 200 million workers across Europe with more transparent and predictable working conditions. We are modernising European labour law and adjusting it to the new world of work. As Members of this Parliament know, today a growing number of workers, and in particular young and female workers, are in atypical forms of employment with often very flexible contracts. This is why we needed to find the right balance. We must ensure protection for workers without overburdening employers and without stifling innovation, and that is exactly what we have done with the proposed directive.  With the new rules in place we will first of all ensure more transparency. All workers in the EU will receive information on key working conditions. Workers will know at the beginning of their employment – this means within the first week – what their basic rights and obligations are. This includes information on their remuneration, their working schedule and the duration of their contracts, and thanks to Parliament, extra information for temporary agency workers.  Around two to three million workers that so far were excluded will now be covered. This includes platform workers, domestic workers, voucher workers, workers on zero-hour contracts and other short-term workers.  However, we do not stop at information rights. The directive also provides completely new substantive rights, like, for example, a limitation on probation periods, a ban on unjustified exclusivity clauses, a right for workers on on—demand contracts to know within which time slots they can be called to work and thanks to this Parliament, a right to compensation if an employer cancels a work assignment on short notice and measures to prevent abuse of on—demand contracts. And there is also the principle that mandatory training should be cost—free to the worker and, again thanks to Parliament, that it should count as working time.

Six million are part-time not chosen. And, of all these people, women are ultimately the most vulnerable to precarious employment. Unfortunately, this trend is growing: the jobs that have been created since the 2008 crisis are often, too often, precarious, poorly paid, poorly protected jobs, which give these workers no prospect. These workers are unable to plan for the medium term, unable to obtain a bank loan, simply unable to organize their lives. The text we will adopt today undoubtedly aims to improve the situation, guarantee better protection and, above all, greater transparency and more information in employment contracts in Europe. This is of course a step forward, Commissioner, you said so. But it is regrettable that the Member States have excluded from the directive employment contracts of less than 12 hours per month. It is regrettable that Member States have been unable to agree on the outright ban on zero hour contracts. So I would say that Europe has proposed a step forward.

I am proud of the result at hand. In the end, it is certainly a compromise that is typical of the work here in our house. A good compromise is characterized by the fact that in the end everyone who contributed to it may have one or two points where they say: I might have wished it different or I would have liked to have put a different emphasis on this. In the end, however, we said with a large majority in committee that things were going in the right direction overall. And I would like to emphasize three points for the EPP Group that have also been very important to me in my work as shadow rapporteur. Firstly, the new directive gives us more employee rights and more protection above all for precarious workers. Second - the Commissioner pointed out that the additional bureaucratic effort for entrepreneurs and medium-sized businesses is really within manageable limits, so that we can really say here that we have also achieved a real balance of interests. And thirdly - that was also very important to us as a group: we have succeeded in ensuring that the legal definition of the concept of worker that the Commission proposed is not in the text, but that this definition continues to be made by the Member States. A uniform definition at European level would have created more legal uncertainty than legal certainty. As a German MEP, I would also like to say that this directive will also improve the situation of workers in my home country - my home country, which is famous in many places for the protection of workers' rights. But even in my German homeland, for example, the collective bargaining coverage is only 52 percent. This means that millions of employees in Germany will also benefit from this directive.

New forms of employment, known as \"atypical\", are multiplying at such a speed that since 2014, 20% of the jobs created correspond to this category.

While drafting this text, which is still insufficient, of course, I, on behalf of my ENL Group, made proposals and gave my support to certain concrete proposals of the rapporteur. It is essential that all our fellow citizens be protected in the same way, regardless of the precariousness of their employment.

First of all, congratulations on the consistency with which the European Commission, thanks to Commissioner Thyssen, is introducing further regulations that materialize the European Pillar of Social Rights. The new directive on transparent and predictable working conditions is important for all workers in the European Union, but especially for those who work on the basis of so-called non-standard or atypical contracts. It is an occasional job, on demand, on a contract, in the checking system, via online platforms, etc. Today, a quarter of European Union citizens work in this way, and half of the new jobs created in recent years are atypical or non-standard contracts . These workers are not subject to the existing directive on the obligation to inform employees about employment conditions. That is why the new directive is very important and gives workers additional rights, that is, they are to receive more information, more precise and faster. Above all, however, this directive will cover a very large part of the growing number of employees on these atypical, non-standard contracts. Only those who work less than twelve hours a month will not be subject to this directive. It is a revolution that will be especially beneficial for women, as they are the ones who supply the majority of precariat positions in the labor market.

Honourable Members of Parliament, with the proposed directive on transparent and predictable working conditions, we focus on what is really necessary for workers in today’s labour market. Flexibility is today inevitable, just like digitalisation. Therefore, we have not sought to prohibit new types of employment, but to support the workers concerned with protection against excessive practices and with the minimum of predictability that everybody needs to organise life. The implementation of this directive will be a common task for Member States, employers and workers, with all the adequate room for social partners to make the rules a success on the ground.  I call on you to support the Directive. It’s a crucial measure of social justice and solidarity for all our citizens. As I said before, Madam President, this directive is also a major achievement to make the European pillar of social rights a reality. We should all be proud of this milestone. Honourable Members, allow me to conclude by making the connection between this directive and our other initiatives – posting of workers, protection against cancelled work, access to social protection for all, the Accessibility Act, the skills agenda, a more European semester and, not to forget, work-life balance. I believe all these initiatives, those decisions, they show what this Commission and this Parliament, together with the Council, have done during our mandate, bringing social Europe back at the centre of the Union’s action.

If it consoles you, which I don't think so, I will tell you that I am also one of those frustrated for not having gone further; but my job as a representative of Parliament was to find a balance point. Basically, what you notice are three \"pains\", we could say. The first is that it does not include everyone, because three hours a week and twelve hours are required. It is true, and we would have preferred that it encompassed the whole world; but look, anyway, in the advance with what we had before, which asked for two months. In any case, I would remind you that we have asked the Commission to exercise great active vigilance so that, if, for example, contracts of eleven hours a month proliferate, then obviously action will have to be taken. Second, there is also the issue of exclusions. I have not understood them, I do not approve of them, I do not understand those lobbies - for example the sea workers - but there was no way to reach a balance agreement without going through there. I say it calmly. And then I find myself before zero hours. We have made zero hours very difficult and they are also, from now on, unrepeatable. They cannot be renewed. At this point, what I want to say to my colleagues is that they consider what I have considered: is it good, even if it is not perfect, is it good that there is this for the future years of European workers? Is it much better than nothing?

Those four freedoms have brought us a lot: more economic growth, more trade, more prosperity. However, Europe is about more than just market, money and trade. We must ensure that the common market really becomes a fair market: a market where employees receive what they are entitled to and are not exploited, where there is no room for bogus self-employment, social dumping or displacement on the labor market, where companies and citizens are affected. clear conditions to be able to operate cross-border without being the victim of unfair competition from rogue companies. So not just a free market, but above all a fair market. Not just free movement of people and services, but fair movement of people and services. To achieve that, we need two things: strict and clear European rules, but also proper enforcement of those rules. We have worked hard on those rules here in recent years. We have made equal pay for equal work in the same place a reality with the Posting of Workers Directive, we have stepped up the fight against undeclared work, we have better protected workers from working with dangerous substances and we have done a lot through the European Pillar of Social Rights to make a fair and social Europe a reality. However, rules are not worth the paper on which they are printed if they are not enforced sufficiently, properly and efficiently. There is a very big challenge there. More than 17 million Europeans live or work in a country other than where they come from. That number has doubled in the last ten years and will only increase in the near future. At the same time, we see that social and labor inspections in the Member States are still often limited to their own national borders, making cross-border enforcement far from effective. We are putting an end to this today: with the establishment of the European Labor Authority, we are giving cross-border enforcement and control a significant boost. We are showing here today that we also take that challenge very seriously as a Parliament. And we show that the European Parliament can deliver, because the European Commission made the proposal barely a year ago and the European Labor Authority can actually get to work. Better information provision for citizens and companies about their rights and obligations, bringing colleagues from different countries together to jointly realize inspections and enforcement, mediating between member states that disagree about how to enforce European rules, make risk analyzes of our weaknesses and how we can improve them can act: there is more than enough to do for the new labor authority. I'm glad it's an authority because an authority needs teeth. Teeth to prevent abuse. Teeth to ensure that confidence in the internal market is maintained in the future. I would therefore like to express my thanks. Firstly, to Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, without whose initiative, energy and enthusiasm this result would not have been achieved today. Thanks also to the Romanian Presidency, with whom we have had a bizarrely intensive schedule of negotiations. Thanks to that commitment, we have this result today. Finally, I would like to thank my colleagues from the other groups. Some of them I have seen more often than my own wife during the negotiation period. Don't tell my wife, but it was totally worth it. We are here today with a good result, thanks to the pleasant and constructive cooperation between us all.

I have always considered this regulation to be the final piece of the agenda of this Commission for fair labour mobility in Europe. I presented the proposal in March 2018 and, one year later, we are here to vote on the final regulation. This impressive result in decision-making owes a lot to the constructive approach taken by both co—legislators and to the commitment and hard work of Parliament’s rapporteur and the successive Council Presidencies. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Jeroen Lenaers, for his extraordinary commitment and his extremely efficient handling of the negotiations on behalf of the Parliament. I would of course also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and the Council Presidency for their constructive work in bringing the file to a rapid and successful conclusion. The European Labour Authority will be the Union’s first operational agency in the area of labour mobility. Its establishment is much needed. Today, 17 million European citizens are living or working in another Member State than that of their citizenship. The European Labour Authority will be there for them, to ensure that European labour mobility rules are applied in a consistent, thorough and fair manner. The Authority will pursue three objectives, which are equally important. First, it will facilitate access to information and services to companies and citizens. When moving across borders, they need to know what their rights and obligations are. ELA will ensure that Member States comply with their information obligations, for example in the area of posting of workers, and it will manage the day—to—day activities of EURES, the European job mobility portal. Second, the authority will facilitate and support cooperation between national authorities that enforce EU legislation in the areas of labour mobility and social security coordination. The Authority will thus enable Member States in cross—border contexts to fight social fraud, abuse of workers’ rights and undeclared work more efficiently. Building on the examples of Eurojust and Europol, the European Labour Authority will bring national experts together under one roof in order to facilitate information exchange and cooperation. No doubt this will significantly contribute to the creation of a common enforcement culture, to efficient exchanges and mutual trust. The European Labour Authority will also give the necessary support for national inspectorates to cooperate through concerted and joint inspections. Third, the European Labour Authority will provide a forum for mediation between national authorities in case of disputes. By promoting dialogue and out-of-court settlements of issues, we aim to facilitate swift responses to disputes which involve cases of individual citizens or companies. I know that, two years ago, when we started referring to the possible establishment of the European Labour Authority, some had doubts about the added value of another European agency. Our proposal already made clear that we wanted to set up an authority with operational tasks that were not yet exercised at EU level, and this is exactly what this regulation has done. The European Labour Authority will be of great practical value in the day—to—day enforcement of labour mobility rules and, at the same time, it will open opportunities for a fair mobility of labour within the European Union. Once adopted, this Commission is ready to take the first practical steps to make the European Labour Authority operational by autumn 2019. I’m really looking forward to your observations later on.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE"}, {"id": 74, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Jens GEIER", "mepid": "96833", "text": "Draftsman for the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. - Madam President, Commissioner Thyssen, ladies and gentlemen!

This also gives honest companies more protection from unfair competition - that's good too. What is not so nice is that we have to wait a little longer until this agency is fully functional. Nevertheless, it is an important milestone. However, we would have liked to see stronger control competencies for the labor authority. It is particularly regrettable that it has not been possible to enforce sanctions against Member States unwilling to cooperate, and I also believe that the poor involvement of social partners in the agency's management is a mistake.

It is of vital importance to endeavour to make the European pillar of social rights everyday living reality for each and every European citizen, no matter from which Member State he comes. Moreover, it must become the guiding light for achieving superior competitiveness of European businesses on the basis of fully-fledged social partnership, collective bargaining and environmental sustainability. The lure for business to succumb to short-termism and the wages race to the bottom not only entails severe exploitation and abuse of mobile labour but also undermines the very foundations on which citizens base their allegiance to the Union and, what is more, their willingness to engage in highly-productive and efficient work. Let me end by urgently inviting all of us here and all those concerned to turn the launching of the European Labour Authority (ELA) this autumn into a high-profile event, and to recommit to building a truly social union with vigorous welfare states as the only possible way to provide citizens with a life in dignity and security and the Union with a promising future in this ever-more challenging world of ours.

Free movement of workers is working, but from time to time issues arise that can undermine the trust in the system and that question fairness and compliance. Those issues, I believe, require an independent authority that will strengthen operational coordination and cooperation between Member States, mediate in cross-border disputes and facilitate dispute settlements. I believe that the final piece of legislation addresses many of the identified problems around the day-to-day operational free movement of workers, and by doing so, I believe it facilitates free movement of workers for all EU citizens and a more streamlined system because of cooperation between Member States, and crucially, it will help to restore trust in the system, trust between Member States and trust between citizens.

And it is an internal market that moves power far away from the citizens, indeed far away from our elected politicians, and that limits our democratic opportunities.

When I received my portfolio on employment, social affairs, skills and labour mobility, I knew that labour mobility would not be the easiest area. I am therefore very happy that, after the division of the Posting of Workers Directive, you are now asked to vote on this regulation, which is another milestone for ensuring fair labour mobility in Europe. It realises the principle of the pillar of social rights in a cross-border context.  Unfortunately, it has not yet been possible for the co-legislators to agree on the proposed modernisation of the social security coordination rules. I am confident, however, that the position that you adopt Thursday in first reading will laid the grounds for a fruitful and, hopefully, swift adoption after the European Parliament’s elections.  The millions of citizens for whom labour mobility is a daily reality, an opportunity, or sometimes a bare necessity, merit to benefit from updated rules as soon as possible. Free movement has always been a founding principle for our European Union and it has remained so even more today. The economies and labour markets of our Member States have become deeply intertwined. Free movement also feeds the connection between our citizens and peoples.  Facilitating free movement while at the same time ensuring that the European rules are applied in a fair way, these have been the guiding principles in my proposals on labour mobility. These guiding principles allowed us to obtain legislative reforms, supported by east and west and north and south, and these principles also underpin the regulation establishing the European Labour Authority. I just call on you to support this regulation.

By establishing the European Labour Authority we are taking a crucial step towards realising a truly fair and a truly social European labour market, where we move from the free movement of workers only to ensuring fair labour mobility – a market where workers’ rights are guaranteed and protected, where there is no room for bogus self—employment, social dumping or unfair competition. In order to achieve all this we need better enforcement of the European rules in the area of labour mobility, and that is exactly what the European Labour Authority is going to do and it will start doing it very soon. This is a landmark achievement and it shows that the European Union can deliver in an area of citizens’ concern and that it can deliver fast. So, once again, a big thank you to the European Commission, Commissioner Thyssen, to the Romanian Presidency and to all our colleagues who worked together in a very good, a very constructive and a very efficient manner to get this done.

I am not going to say that we, the politicians, are unsuited or incapable to carry out other professional work.

I hereby call on the Member States to listen finally to the calls of this Parliament and propose always two candidates to achieve a gender balance and follow the Irish example – that means having fair, public competition to select those people, in the spirit of Article 255 in our European Treaties. Dear colleagues, we must reconsider whether we really need an ECA member from all the Member States simultaneously. Is there really so much to be audited? Why can’t we manage this institution by taking turns: 14 auditors for one period and 14 for another? If we fail, there will be more disgruntled and unhappy people around, ready to destroy Bastilles all over Europe.

Definitely our thoughts are with the millions of people affected by this devastating disaster.  I have said it many times in this room: Europe is about solidarity. Europe is about solidarity not only inside Europe, but also outside Europe. So we stood by the side of all three countries, with emergency funding, with in—kind assistance, and with experts on the ground.  Allow me to summarise our response, our European response, to this catastrophe. First, funding. Just a few hours after the landfall of the cyclone, we released an immediate package of assistance of EUR 3.5 million, to support access with air services to cut-off areas and hard-to-reach communities and for immediate shelter, water and sanitation. On 9 April, we mobilised an additional EUR 12 million in humanitarian assistance for the three countries to provide shelter, water and sanitation, food, health and psychosocial support. This brings the total EU humanitarian assistance to over EUR 15 million. Second, in—kind assistance. With separate funding of EUR 4 million we helped to deploy through our excellent instrument – the EU Civil Protection Mechanism (UCPM) – relief items and in—kind assistance offered by nine EU Member States: Portugal, Spain, France, Austria, UK, Luxembourg, Germany, Italy, and Denmark. I am really grateful to these countries. In parallel, we produced and shared 57 Copernicus satellite maps upon the request of Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. Third point, on expert teams. We immediately deployed eight EU humanitarian, epidemiology and hydrology experts to the ground, to conduct assessments and support the response in the three countries, including to the recent cholera outbreak, unfortunately. In addition, a civil protection team of 13 people was deployed on 23 March via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism, and of course we also helped to deploy expert teams from our Member States. All of them are still in Mozambique as we speak and are helping to save lives on the ground.  Allow me to make a nominal reference to these teams because I strongly believe we have to show to our people that our teams can do excellent work on the ground. As I said, they are still in Mozambique because they are real heroes on the ground. Portugal sent one search and rescue and one medical team. Luxembourg sent a satellite communication team to help with connectivity in affected areas. Germany and Denmark sent a team to help with water purification – very important especially because of the cholera outbreak. Italy, Spain and Germany sent emergency medical teams and equipment, also very important because of the problem of cholera and maybe other diseases. So it is thanks to rescEU, our new system to fight against natural disasters, that we can help decisively the Member States to deploy assistance inside and outside the European Union. And of course help save more lives as our campaign inside Europe.  Since day one, my team and I are monitoring the situation in the three affected countries around the clock, 24/7. Through our Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) – you will know about this – in Brussels and of course through our experts on the ground. We will continue to lead the international support efforts to the three countries, and you can rest assured that the European Union will do its best, our best, to support the longer-term reconstruction needs in the three affected countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 1, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 155, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "Many Thanks!I can see that our colleagues from the Environment Committee have finally let go of the presidency.If you allow, we will wait a few seconds for Mrs Ciot to be here to tell us what she wants to say on behalf of the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 156, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Melania Gabriela Ciot", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, thank you for giving me the time to present our points. I would like to thank the honourable Members for inviting me to address this important topic today. Disasters call for solidarity, for acting together in support of those in need. Disasters teach us valuable lessons. We should translate them into life lessons of strength and resilience. The tropical cyclone Idai and the subsequent flooding we witnessed in recent weeks have brought enormous destruction and human losses to southern Africa. Nearly three million people have been affected in Mozambique, Malawi and Zimbabwe, and almost 1 000 people have lost their lives. Many are still missing.  In Mozambique alone, 240 000 houses have been destroyed, damaged or flooded, more than 160 000 people have been internally displaced, and over 4 000 cholera cases have been have been reported. Malaria is on the rise. In Malawi, the cyclone and the floods have destroyed many fields of recently planted crops. The potential loss of harvest will have a severe impact on the livelihoods of small—scale farmers who depend on agricultural production. Women and children are heavily affected. In Zimbabwe, the floods aggravated an existing severe humanitarian crisis caused by drought and a poor harvest. Food insecurity and malnutrition, which were already at alarming levels, risk worsening further. In all three countries, the humanitarian needs are enormous. They include food, drinking water, shelter, health and nutrition, as well as education, protection and logistics. The Mozambique Humanitarian Response Plan and the Zimbabwe Flash Appeal are asking for a total of USD 342 million. Currently only 23% has been funded so more efforts will be needed. As you know, the EU and the Member States mobilised quickly in response to these natural disasters. Humanitarian and civil protection assistance has been offered by the Commission and the Member States in support of the affected countries. In support of the EU response to this disaster, the Presidency of the Council took the necessary actions to raise awareness on the humanitarian and funding needs by opening a monitoring page on the EU’s Integrated Political Crisis Response arrangements (IPCR) web platform. In this respect, we moved the IPCR into monitoring mode. This has facilitated a constant exchange of information between the Member States, the Commission, the European External Action Service (EEAS) and the relevant EU agency on the evolving situation, the humanitarian needs and the EU response. We included the disaster caused by the tropical cyclone Idai on the agenda of the relevant Council working parties to facilitate in—depth discussions among Member States and the Commission. We welcome the fact that Parliament’s Committee on Development (DEVE) is also interested in discussing the situation. Our intensive exchanges through various channels have shown that the EU and its Member States were quick to react in response to this disaster. Member States have contributed extensively by providing humanitarian – and that means more than EUR 60 million – and civil protection assistance in kind, including shelters, food and power generators, as well as the deployment of water purification, satellite communication, medical emergency teams, flood rescue and relief modules, experts all provided through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. A European civil protection team led by a Romanian expert has been deployed to Mozambique since 23 March 2019 in order to assess the needs and ensure coordination and distribution of the aid provided by Member States. There is very good cooperation and coordination on the ground. A number of Member States also made available military assets, such as ships, helicopters and aircraft for logistics and transport. Member States have allocated substantial amounts of funding to the humanitarian response. Thus, the necessary services are currently being contracted and implemented. We welcome the fact that the Commission has also allocated more than EUR 50 million euros for humanitarian support.  This brings us to the importance of implementation. Our close consultations with Member States and the Commission have shown that protection must be at the heart of our emergency response. Many families have been separated. Women and children are disproportionately affected by displacement, and women and girls are particularly vulnerable to gender—based violence and sexual exploitation. We also need to ensure that education can resume as soon as possible for thousands of children affected by the crisis. Lastly, we should consider using cash assistance wherever the circumstances allow for it. This is our analysis of the immediate needs and the emergency response. A post-disaster needs assessment will indicate the necessary action to address the long-term recovery needs. I now look forward to hearing your views and the information that the Commission will provide.

Is further reflection needed to understand that we are facing a phenomenon - global warming - that affects everyone and to which we must respond globally? The countries that are involved in this natural disaster, however, have another condition. They are poor countries. And the same climate disaster destroys those who have the least the most.

The British Government has warned that any LNA advance on Tripoli would be very damaging for the political and diplomatic solutions on offer and risk a descent into more widespread violence and chaos.  Prime Minister al-Sarraj of the UN-supported Government of National Accord in Tripoli has given further warnings that the advance on Tripoli risks sparking a fresh migration crisis in the Mediterranean if the situation worsens. With reports suggesting that many refugees are being forced to join the various militias operating throughout Libya, these warnings should not go unheeded.  Given the complexity of the situation and the multitude of actors involved, the way ahead is fraught with hazards. However, the UN-mediated talks are the only peaceful options still on the table. The EU and EU Member States must therefore do all they can to support these talks with one united voice.  To those who see in General Haftar a potential strong man who could consolidate power and bring order to that chaotic country, I would urge them to pay attention to the various reports in the public domain that question such simple assertions. Significant military and political opposition remains in his way and there is little evidence to suggest that he could easily hold the country together in the longer term.

The LNA, led by General Haftar, attacked Tripoli at the very time when UN Secretary-General Guterres was visiting the country and on the eve of the National Conference, a conference that still has the potential to represent a new beginning for Libya.  The European Union has worked for almost one year together – very closely together – with the United Nations and the Special Envoy to prepare the ground for a Libyan-led and Libyan-owned National Conference that would prepare the ground for elections under the appropriate legal and constitutional conditions, and we have seen day by day the aspiration, the readiness, the desire of all the Libyan people, the citizens of Libya, to move their country forward, to turn the page, to unite and build unity and peace for a country that has potentially an enormous capacity to move forward, a lot of resources and a lot of potential.  The National Conference still represents the hope of an entire country. And just a few days before that military escalation took place, I was myself, together with Guterres, with the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, with the Chairperson of the African Union and with Ghassan Salamé, the UN Special Envoy, in Tunis at the margins of the League of Arab States summit, reaffirming the unity of the international community to support this Libyan-led, Libyan-owned political process that would have helped in turning the page and uniting the country in peace.  The offensive against Tripoli has been, is still, an attack against hope, an attack against the concrete perspective of achieving peace in Libya, and we have seen this happen before. When peace becomes a real possibility – concrete, possible – it is then also that we see that the resistance against peace gets stronger and more evident.  Now we are facing a protracted conflict with victims in high numbers, including civilians, and a stalemate on the ground. A situation that is blocked on the ground in terms of the line of the conflict, but still very active in terms of clashes, with the use of arms that we shouldn’t be seeing used in Libya.  This confirms what we have always known in Europe and in the international community, at least in recent years – the reason there cannot be any military solution to the Libyan conflict. If the war continues, it will only lead to greater suffering and if someone continues to seek military victory everybody will lose. The only scenario where the whole country, where all Libyans, in an inclusive and unified manner, move forward, is a negotiated political solution.  If the Libyan parties will not seek a win-win solution that the international community, starting with the European Union, would be ready to accompany and support – and the Libyan parties will not seek, I would say, a win-win solution – then all the people of Libya will continue to suffer and the entire region will continue to suffer.  I just spoke again today with the UN Special Envoy, Ghassan Salamé. Our work is joint and the European Union supports his work on a daily basis. Our support for his work, I would say, is even stronger today than it has ever been in the past, along three main lines on which the European Union and our Member States have acted united in these last weeks. First, to affirm the need to open humanitarian corridors as a matter of urgency and fully respect humanitarian international law. Second, to establish an immediate ceasefire, that I am sure the UN is ready to negotiate. Third, to go back to the political track with the holding of the National Conference as soon as possible to give Libyans, the Libyan people, men and women of all generations, of all cities and in the countryside of the country, the chance to outline their common way forward.  These are the three elements on which I am sure – for sure the European Union, for sure the United Nations – but I’m sure also the rest of the international community would be ready to support and accompany the Libyan people.  Let me add that it is not only Libyans, not only the region, that are suffering. Refugees and migrants trapped in detention centres are also at risk. We are working with the IOM and with UNHCR to evacuate them outside Libya or to move them to safer places inside Libya. The most recent flights that brought dozens of migrants back home safely and voluntarily left Tripoli just a few days ago. Our work with the UN agencies continues but obviously conditions on the ground are more and more difficult by the day and this is also why we call on all parties to allow the swift and unconditional evacuation of detention centres on the front line, as also requested by High Commissioner Grandi last week.  The work we have done together within the UN agencies, with the help of the African Union on the ground, with the help of the Libyan authorities on the ground, has brought in this last year enormous results with tens of thousands of migrants voluntarily and safely repatriated through the work of the IOM and those in need of international protection protected through the UNHCR channels.  The conflict in Libya, the escalation from the military perspective – I know that some in Europe perceive it as a growing threat of growing flows, but it also represents first and foremost a threat to the lives of those migrants and refugees that are trapped in Libya and whose lives are more at risk than others, and for which we have been trying with the UN agencies to work to try and save lives and to try and empty the detention centres. The military offensive is also making this work more difficult.  To conclude, let me restate very clearly, a swift return to the negotiating table is essential, it is still possible. We believe more than ever that the UN track and the National Conference are the only real opportunity for a peaceful resolution. The multiplication or the proliferation of different initiatives may lead to destruction that would definitely not be helpful at this moment. Humanitarian corridors and respect for international humanitarian law, ceasefire negotiated by the UN and a return to the negotiating table and the holding of a National Conference as soon as possible, with the full participation of the Libyan people.  I would like to add that when I say Libyan people, I refer to Libyan men and women. Let me take a moment to praise the Libyan women that have been sometimes in the shadow trying to accompany the political process, so far, in difficult conditions and I believe that the European Union, together with the United Nations, has an interest, as in every conflict we face, in promoting the role of women at the negotiating table and in the reconciliation process on the ground.  This is what we are trying to contribute to achieving, supporting the UN work, trying to unite the Europeans, and I can say that if in the past we have seen different approaches, I believe today that all European Union Member States understand that our common work is required to avoid Libyans turning in different directions and disaggregating the potential of unity through a political dialogue that is in their hands.  We stated clearly last time, last week, the European Union’s united position along these lines in the name of all the 28 Member States, and I would now appeal to all the regional players and the international players to unite in support of the United Nations’ work, in support of the political perspective for dialogue and unity in Libya, to avoid the Libyan stakeholders themselves finding external reasons for disuniting even further. On the European side, I can say that today they find a common, united front in support of the United Nations’ efforts to bring the parties around the table and define a common perspective for Libya in peace and security.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 173, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, Madam High Representative, the situation observed over the past week in Libya is all the more regrettable as in February, a few weeks ago, an agreement was reached between the head of government, Mr. al-Sarraj, and General Haftar.

It is a very serious problem, but it seems to me that the commitment presented by the High Representative does not give us much concrete hope on what the effective influence of the European Union and the Member States can be for a short-term solution and above all for to prevent Libya from plunging into chaos immediately or in the near future. The impasse in the fighting between General Haftar's army and the militias defending Prime Minister Sarraj could indicate a turning point, in fact it could again leave wide margins for politics and negotiation. Haftar did not break through the front, did not penetrate the heart of the capital and in all likelihood the defection of some militias from Tripoli on which he counted did not occur. So there is still a modest ten-day budget and defining the ongoing civil war in Tripoli is certainly an excess, perhaps wanted by environments that can't wait to exploit this pretext to maybe reopen the Italian ports to new waves of illegal immigrants. I believe that at this point it must be said that the failure of military options raises the prices and importance of a key country like Italy, whose government seems to me to have what it takes to be co-protagonist of a process of rebalancing and reorganization of a very important area for Europe, extremely dangerous if we think of the presence of jihadists, of Allah's warriors. But then I would say because in addition to having excellent relations with both rival leaders, we do not exploit the position of Italy, which has kept its embassy open and confirms itself as a country ready to play a preponderant role, a very important role that I think is much superior. to the absolutely non-existent one of this European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 179, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "- Madam President, the developments of recent weeks in Libya once again highlight the mistakes of the European Union's foreign policy in that country.

The government of national unity, recognized by the United Nations, resists him at the cost of heavy fighting. The situation is worrying, as this destabilization of Libya risks having serious consequences for the whole region and beyond for Europe. It is therefore right that the European states call on the belligerents for a ceasefire. The UN mission, UNSMIL, unfortunately failed to bring about a truce. As for the UN Security Council, it is blocked by the rivalry between the United States and Russia. The United States wants to encourage him to call on Haftar to stop his offensive, while Russia would rather encourage him to call on the two belligerents to cease hostilities. The Libyan conflict is in fact the expression of a struggle for influence between these two great powers, but not only between them. Like Russia, President Macron's France supports Haftar, which Italy blames. Europe is divided and therefore does not seem able to influence events. I particularly regret that France is not up to the role it should have. She was the one who destabilized Libya in 2011 over President Sarkozy's reckless decision to overthrow Colonel Gaddafi. It is this that is compromising the search for a solution today. However, we would have to move forward together, as Haftar's offensive risks triggering a new wave of migration to Italy. An Italian intelligence report says at least 6,000 foreign refugees in Libya are already ready to embark for Italy. Ultimately, 800,000 migrants could surge into Europe, according to estimates by the Italian Prime Minister.

I would have loved to answer these questions; maybe I will do that anyway.  Let me also say it is somehow sad that as we discuss something so serious on which there is no surprise – unfortunately for years now we have been struggling and working, not only the European Union, but also the United Nations and some of our partners in the region like the African Union or the Arab League, we have been struggling with the situation – it is somehow sad for me to see that in what is the last part-session of this mandate in Parliament there are more spectators at these debates than Members of the Parliament.  Sorry to say this, but I think this issue deserves a little bit more attention from your colleagues. But this is praise for those of you who are in the room. I would also like to thank you for the support for the work we have done in these recent weeks. It has not been easy in these recent years to build a common European position on this. You know that the starting points were not necessarily always converging but today we do have a converging European policy and action to stabilise the country, giving the Libyans, the citizens, the stakeholders, the different interlocutors, the different institutions, as fragile as they are, as conflictual as they are, the possibility to find their own way to unite in the country.  I want to thank this Parliament for its support for this work and I think that we have managed to achieve some good work even in these very difficult circumstances. I think we can be proud of at least two things. One is the support we have consistently given to the UN and the UN Special Envoys over time. They have always very much counted and relied upon the European Union support – politically, financially, diplomatically, and on the ground.  I was also very proud of the fact that our personnel went back to Tripoli before the personnel of most of our Member States. Recently this has changed, but I’m looking forward to having them back in Tripoli as soon as possible. I myself visited the premises of our offices in Tripoli, reinaugurating them after a long period of absence from the city, and I’m very much looking forward to this situation going back to sort of normal – probably it’s never fully normal in Libya and for sure not in these times – but I think that the Libyans know that the Europeans, and the European Union as an institution, have always been trying to help in a constructive, honest manner, again, both financially, politically and diplomatically. This has been also thanks to the support of this Parliament. The second thing I’m proud of in this difficult environment is the work that we’ve managed to finally start, and that we need to consolidate, on the detention centres, aiming to empty them and close them together with the UN agencies. I would have dreamt of a debate in this Hemicycle today on Libya and Libyans and not always on Libya and migration, because if the situation is deteriorating on the ground in the military escalation in Libya, let me tell you very frankly my first concern is for the human losses, for the deterioration of the perspectives for the political dialogue.  Obviously there is a risk of migration for the European Union but there is first and foremost a risk for the migrants themselves, for their lives, and I thank those of you that have raised this, because I think we have to take into consideration first and foremost the fact that every person we are referring to is a human being, and secondly that there is work we need to do with Libya and with Libyans for the sake of Libya and Libyans themselves. It’s not only a transit country: it is a neighbouring country, and it’s a country, that deserves to be treated as a partner from our side.  But having said that, yes, in recent years we have started to work with the UN agencies the IOM and UNHCR, and with the African Union, to empty detention centres, to combat the trafficking and smuggling of human beings, and in one year or so, we have managed to help the IOM and UNHCR, and in particular the IOM, to evacuate some 40 000 stranded migrants and refugees from the detention centres back to either the UNHCR centres from where they are then protected further, and/or to their countries of origin, also with the cooperation of the African Union and its Member States.  Obviously all of this work, as I was signalling, in a situation that is militarily escalating and is less secure on the ground, becomes more difficult. This is why I supported, and I reiterate this again, the call that Filippo Grandi made last week for all the parties to guarantee access to the personnel, the staff of the UNHCR and the IOM, to the detention centres and this work to be continued because it is extremely important and vital for their own sake.  Some of you asked me specific questions that relate more to our work on migration than to Libya. I’m happy to be very clear on that. I’m on the record already on these issues, I’ve been very clear. No, the European Union does not consider Libya as a safe country. This is something that not only I, but also other colleagues from the Commission, have repeatedly stated. This position has not changed, and it seems quite self-evident given the current circumstances.  Some of the Members of this European Parliament asked me about Operation Sophia. As you know, because this has not been a secret, my suggestion to the Member States was not that of withdrawing the naval assets. I’ve always argued in favour of the naval assets remaining in the international waters because they have proven to be a very effective deterrent for the smugglers and the traffickers. If arrivals from Libya to Italy have gone down by more than 80% in the last couple of years it is thanks to the presence of Operation Sophia at sea; among other things, but mainly that. Obviously you see the contradiction in terms of having a naval operation without naval assets.  Unfortunately, the decision of Member States has been in another direction. I still hope that they can reconsider their decision and decide to redeploy naval assets in the international waters. I think that in these particular circumstances it would make a lot of sense, not only to deter the activities of the smugglers and the traffickers of human beings across the Mediterranean, but also to fulfil the duties, the responsibilities, we have taken of implementing the UN Security Council Resolutions when it comes to the arms and the oil embargo control which obviously can be much more effectively carried out with a naval presence at sea.  I believe – and again I have no problem in saying this in this Hemicycle, I’ve said it publicly already, very openly – that without the naval assets Operation Sophia is not able to fulfil its full mandate in an effective manner, so I hope the Member States will reconsider this decision. It’s their responsibility, it’s their choice, and I hope they will come to different conclusions in the coming weeks.  I would like to conclude by saying that I would like to thank again all of you from the different political groups for the support for this strong call and strong work that we’re doing on the ground, not since yesterday but for years, together with the UN, for at this moment going back to a Libyan-owned and a Libyan-led political process that can be the only hope for the country to get out of this endless transition, out of the conflict, to de-escalate the military tensions and attacks, and to find a way to create strong inclusive institutions and peace in the country.  I believe that we can clearly say that, apart from a few voices, I have seen here broad support for this strong call, first of all for the open humanitarian corridors for delivery of urgent humanitarian aid, an immediate ceasefire, and a return to the political track and the convening of a National Conference under the auspices of the UN that we have prepared together, supported together, and that I believe still represents the hope for Libyans to have a proper country and a proper present and future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 198, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "The conversation is closed.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 199, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Ana GOMES", "mepid": "28306", "text": "  in writing. – The EU cannot excuse itself on what Libya became.

Both originate from the war of 1967, but they are separate ones – on the one hand, the decision by the US administration to recognise the Golan Heights as Israeli territory, and on the other, the Israeli Government’s settlement policy in the West Bank. So let me tackle the two issues separately during this debate.  First, the US recognition of the Golan Heights. The European Union has a very simple and clear position that I’ve had the possibility to reiterate and restate in a very clear manner over time. More recently, the European Union does not recognise Israeli sovereignty over any of the territories occupied by Israel since June 1967, in line with international law and with UN Security Council resolutions 242 and 497 – and this also applies to the Golan Heights. On 27 March, I issued a declaration on behalf of all the 28 Member States, clarifying that this is the position of the European Union on the status of the Golan Heights. It has always been our position and it has not changed.  In parallel, the five European Union Member States who currently sit in the UN Security Council, which are the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland, expressed this common position in New York in a joint stakeout. So we always ask for the European Union, as Member States, to speak with one voice. This was effectively done in this case, and this is not the only one. I have to say, I want to thank the five Member States that are currently sitting in the UN Security Council, because the practice of coordinating positions – they’re expressing these positions together, including with public press statements done jointly by the five of them, including meetings with myself to coordinate positions of the EU Member States in the Security Council – is more and more often. I think this is also fulfilling the responsibility that we, as Europeans, have to support the multilateral system and the rules-based international order in these times more, in general.  Coming back to our points on the agenda today, the second issue to discuss is the Israeli Government’s settlement policy. I will not comment on the potential policies of a future government that is not even established yet. What I can say is what we are seeing in recent times: over the past months, the Israeli settlement’s construction has continued. Only last week, plans for more than 4600 new housing units were advanced by the Israeli authorities. Right after the announcement, we issued a statement to repeat that we consider all settlement activity illegal under international law, and that settlements erode the viability of the two-state solution. In fact, the two-state solution is not only fading away; it is being dismantled piece by piece. I think it is important for us, the European Union – again, united in this – to say clearly that abandoning the two-state solution would bring greater chaos not only to the Holy Land, but also to the entire Middle East, which is already facing a very difficult situation due to the proliferation of crises we have seen in the region in the last years.  The next escalation of violence in Israel and Palestine could easily spiral out of control, and it would have tragic consequences in a region as unstable as today’s Middle East, not to mention the importance that the two-state solution and the creation of a Palestinian state consequently has for the entire public opinion in the Arab world – again, in a region that has known relevant turmoil in the last years. Our first duty, then, is to keep the two—state perspective alive and to preserve the possibility of new negotiations towards peace to take place. In order to be realistic and successful, any future plan for Israel and Palestine will have to start from the internationally agreed parameters, recognise them, and this includes the 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps and the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of the two states. On this as well, the European Union has been united and very clear over the years and we will continue to do so.  The European Union will recognise changes to the pre-1967 borders only if and when agreed by the parties, including with regard to Jerusalem. This is a principled position, but it is also based on a realistic assessment of the situation on the ground, because the two-state solution is, first and foremost, essential for peace, but is also essential for security, starting from the security of Israel. It is essential for democracy, both in Israel and in Palestine and it is essential to guarantee a truly sustainable economic growth for both Israelis and Palestinians. And let me add – most importantly, even – it is essential for peace, security and economic growth for the entire region, starting from the neighbouring countries.  If the situation does not improve, it will get worse. That is the reality we have seen in these years, and in these difficult times I believe that keeping this perspective alive is the most courageous and the most fruitful contribution we can do and the best service to peace and stability and security in the region. This is what the European Union will continue to do in the coming months, with all those who are ready to engage towards a just and lasting and sustainable peace.  Starting from our Arab partners, let me say that in the last few months we’ve had the chance of meeting with the leadership of the Arab League countries both in the first-ever European Union League of Arab States summit in Egypt, and, with my participation, the third in a row to the summit of the League of Arab States just a few weeks ago. I can tell you that this position of the European Union on the two-state solution, but also on the Golan Heights, has been probably one of the main elements of discussion and is probably one of the main elements that brings together the Europeans and the Arabs in this difficult moment in our common difficult region. So I’m very much looking forward to continue working together with them on this specific issue that is so important for security and peace in the Mediterranean.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 202, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, Madam High Representative, my group is opposed to this debate.

For example, the United States has disassociated itself from the Iranian agreement that you supported, it has also disassociated itself from COP 21, and when it comes to Israel, of course, the United States supports the party. the most extreme of the Israeli government, particularly in deciding to change its embassy to Jerusalem considering it to be the capital. And now, with the United States' recognition of Israel’s sovereignty over the Golan Heights, the White House is sending international law and United Nations resolutions rolling. However, the Commission, supported by the Council, yesterday confirmed its willingness to continue its trade negotiations with the United States, which I consider to be a rogue state which thus flouts any current multilateralism. So what to do? You, Madam High Representative, have used everything that was in your hands, politics, diplomacy. But I think there are two tools that have not been activated: they are the trade agreements and they are the association agreements.

The European Union sees Israel and the Israelis as partners and friends, it sees the Palestinians and the Palestinian Authority as our partners and friends, and we also continue to see our American friends in the United States as our partners and friends. This doesn’t mean that our positions or our policies are determined elsewhere. Our positions are determined on the basis of the conviction of what we believe is in the best interest of peace and stability in the region – which is also our European region – and on respect for international principles and international laws, and this doesn’t change.  Reaffirming clearly and in a united manner, as you mentioned, our position doesn’t mean being hostile to interlocutors or partners that, in the meantime, might change their position. It means being self-confident about the fact that we’ve always believed – and we continue to believe – that, first, ‘might makes right’ is not a good principle on which to base foreign policy. The idea that you can change borders with the use of military force is a dangerous one – in Europe, in the Middle East and elsewhere. This is why our position on the Golan Heights has been so clear, because we believe that international rules, international law and international standards must be upheld, and that this is a principle that it is in the interest of everybody to uphold in a very consistent and coherent manner.  If you think of the situation in the Middle East, but also if you think of the situation in Europe or elsewhere, international law affirms it very clearly: borders cannot be changed by military force and this is a principle behind which the European Union will continue to firmly stand in a united manner.  I think this unity and this clarity together have made us relevant in upholding a principle and a situation in very difficult circumstances. The image I have in my mind at this moment when I think of the Middle East, where you actually do not have a process at all – it’s not that the process is stuck, you do not have a peace process currently – the image I have in my mind is that of – I don’t know if this is an English expression, but in Italian we say ‘put your foot in the door to avoid it banging’. It doesn’t mean opening the door wide and it doesn’t mean being able to restart a peace process.  To tell you the truth, to start a peace process that is consistent today we would need to have an international and regional consensus on the parameters – on the need to have a two-state solution – and you would need to have political will on the two sides and also in Washington. On the European side, it’s full and it’s clear.  What we have to avoid today, together with our partners in the region, starting with the Arab countries – and I think in particular of Egypt that has such an important role both in the Arab League but also on Gaza, and of Jordan that has such an important role on the holy places – what we have to avoid is that this trend continues, consolidates and becomes irreversible to a point where, as Elena Valenciano mentioned, the two—state solution becomes impossible, and avoid that the dismantling of the two—state solution gets to the impossibility of achieving it whenever the political will is there.  I know that this is a minimal approach, but you have to be pragmatic and realistic when dealing with foreign policy. I remember that very well. When I started my mandate, my first visit was to Israel and Palestine. I said back then – almost five years ago, four—and-a—half years ago – that it is possible to solve this conflict, and it is true. I still believe it because the international parameters are clear, but without the political will of the parties and without international consensus – which we don’t have at the moment – on those international parameters, I do not see this process producing an outcome in terms of a two-state solution. We Europeans know very well that if it’s not going to be a two-state solution, it’s not going to be a solution. I believe that the Israelis know that perfectly well, the Palestinians know it perfectly well and the region knows it perfectly well. So I believe that, as friends of Israel, as friends of Palestine, and as friends of the region – let me also refer to the Arab Peace Initiative that I still consider a good basis for negotiations – the European Union is convinced, and will continue to be united and clear on this conviction, that it is in the interest of the Israelis, the Palestinians and the region to continue to have in mind a two—state objective and a two—state solution. That is also vital. I would like to say this very clearly for those in the Hemicycle who have raised this. It is also vital for the security of Israelis and of Israel as such.  I think I will stop here on this point. I am looking forward to the continuation of our debates on the next points.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 221, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "I close the debate.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 222, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Péter NIEDERMÜLLER", "mepid": "124723", "text": "in writing. \"This debate doesn't make much sense today.\" At most, it can be “used” by those who are interested in it to further fuel the anti-Israel sentiment.

We also know that Donald Trump recognized Israel’s supremacy over the Golan primarily because he wanted to help Netanyahu’s election campaign. However, this did not help the situation in Israel much. At the same time, we all know that the Golan cannot be debated without taking into account Israel’s legitimate expectations of its own security. It is the primary duty of every country, every nation, to ensure the security of its citizens. This is also the case for Israel, whose northern borders are particularly vulnerable. Iran’s presence in Syria, the terrorist attacks of Hezbollah, to name just a few. If we do not take these aspects into account, we will only have a one-sided sham. Just as the hypocrisy that leads nowhere is the claim that a precondition for peace is a return to pre-1967 borders.

For four months now they have demonstrated, not only against the dramatic increase in the price of essential goods, but mainly and also for freedom, peace and justice. The image of a Sudanese student – a girl standing in a white dress on the roof of a car, speaking to the crowd – has already become a symbol. She’s now called the Sudanese Statue of Liberty, and we Europeans want to support this aspiration to liberty. The Europeans want the people of Sudan to succeed. We want their call for liberty to be heard and to translate into real change for a country that has already suffered too much. Last week the Sudanese military took over power and put Omar al-Bashir under house arrest. As you all know, al-Bashir has been indicted by the International Criminal Court, and we have repeatedly asked to execute the arrest warrant. The military leaders initially announced a two-year transition to be led by a transitional military council, composed of different strands of the security forces. This announcement was quickly rejected by both the protesters and the opposition parties. They asked for a concrete guarantee of a much quicker civilian transition. We have supported this request, indicating that a military council would not provide the right answers to the people’s demands and requesting a swift handover to a civilian transitional government. Over the last few days, the military establishment has tried to bridge the gap with a certain show of goodwill. The head of the transitional military council was changed; the head of National Intelligence and Security Service resigned; and some political detainees were freed. These steps have signalled that there may be space for a negotiation. It is clear that, without a true transition, the crisis in Sudan is likely to continue. To prevent such a scenario, there has to be a swift handover to a civilian transitional government with real decision-making authority. This would open the way for a peaceful, credible and inclusive political process to finally address the Sudanese people’s demand for political and economic reforms. Our first priority must be to prevent further violence. We welcome the lifting of the curfew established on the day of the coup, and we call on all parties to refrain from the use of force and any form of provocation. We also expect further confidence-building measures to be taken by the transitional military council, such as the liberation of all remaining political detainees and the reform of the security sector. Security forces must be held accountable for the deaths and the abuses that have occurred in recent weeks and months. These measures would help create the right environment for meaningful political negotiations, so that all parties – including a transitional military council, the Sudanese Professionals Association and other political actors – can cooperate in good faith. It is also important that the opposition remains united at this critical moment. Let me conclude by referring to the fact that in our statement, in our positions last week, we referred to the position taken by the chairperson of the African Union Commission, Moussa Faki. Today, I can only subscribe to the position taken yesterday by the African Union’s Peace and Security Council. The African Union has demanded the immediate handover of power to a civilian-led transitional authority, which should happen in the next 15 days, and this transitional authority, once installed, should ensure an inclusive and consultative process to agree on the exact modalities of the transition towards free, fair and transparent elections. And, just like our African brothers and sisters, we want the transition to be managed by civilians. So we fully support the African Union demand and position on this issue, as on many others. As long as this is not the case, as long as the transition is not managed by civilians, the European Union will not recognise the legitimacy of the transitional military council. But as soon as a civilian transition takes place, the European Union will be ready to accompany it, both politically and also economically.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 225, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Joachim ZELLER", "mepid": "96762", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mister President!

With institutions, democratic movements, civil society and other efforts crushed, state resources systematically robbed at the cost of education to sustain the security apparatus.

The fear of falling back under the clutches of a despotic regime like that of al-Bashir is too great.

In light of these events, I therefore applaud the High Representative's approach. Only a credible and inclusive process can meet the aspirations of the Sudanese people and carry out those reforms the country needs, but to trigger this process an immediate transfer of power to a civilian government is necessary.

I would maybe answer a specific question that was raised about what kind of strategy and what kind of alliances we plan to put in place. We are already building to try and achieve this transition towards a civilian government and free, fair and democratic elections. As I said in my opening remarks, as always whenever our positions converge – which happens often – our first interlocutor here is the African Union. I refer to the very clear position that the African Union has taken in these days, which I believe has been extremely important, also considering what some other colleagues were mentioning: the fact that these changes in Sudan are part of a bigger shift, that is a mix of hope and challenges in the broader region around the Horn of Africa, with some winds of change that are blowing also in other countries. By that, I mean the opportunities that the opening of talks between Ethiopia and Eritrea is bringing, but also the very severe challenges both from a security perspective and from a humanitarian perspective that the region is still facing.  Our role, I think, with the full support of this House – and I know I can speak here for the Commission but also for the Council – is that of accompanying this democratic transition, bringing it hopefully to a civilian outcome, and working hand—in—hand with the African Union and the countries in the region to try and make sure that this happens and that, in particular, the women and the young people of Sudan find their aspirations met in this transition. But, as with all transitions, it is difficult; there are some opportunities, but also some risks and some challenges.  I would also personally like to thank the colleagues that have taken the opportunity in their last interventions in this last part-session of the plenary to thank me, and I want also to reciprocate and say that it has been a pleasure for me to work with this Parliament, and in particular with those colleagues that are most involved in foreign and security policy issues. I will be with you until Thursday, until the votes at the very last sitting, so I guess that we will have other opportunities to say goodbye and thank each other for the good cooperation we have had during these five years.

Mass disinformation campaigns and malicious cyber—activities, including attacks on the electoral infrastructure, are increasingly aiming to discredit and undermine the electoral processes and our democracies, while polarising our societies. As elections take place in all Member States during the same period of four days, they are particularly sensitive from the point of view of the risk associated with cyber—attacks and disinformation. If some attacks were to be successful in one Member State, it would most likely have a domino effect and affect the democratic processes in the other 27. Thus, it would discredit the EU institutions as a whole. In addition, it is a particularly important period for our national authorities, as more than fifty presidential, national, local or regional elections are due to be held in Member States by 2020. When setting out our six-month Presidency programme, we identified as a priority the need for streamlined and sustained action to protect free and democratic EU elections. Combating disinformation and increasing the EU capacities to deter and respond to cyber—attacks were also regarded as key elements in view of securing the electoral process. We attach great importance to this subject, which has been recurrent on the agenda of the European Council in recent months. The EU institutions and Member States have indeed an important and complementary role to play, each in the remit of their competences in the protection of the democratic processes. It requires concerted efforts by the EU and the Member States, but also from civil society and industry online platforms. Our response is comprehensive, with a focus on both the internal and external dimension of the threat. In February 2019, the Council and its Member States adopted conclusions on securing free and fair European elections. They welcomed the Commission package, which included a legislative proposal amending the regulation on European political parties and foundations, which was in the meantime adopted by the co—legislators. They also welcomed the joint action plan against disinformation. Honourable Members, I take this opportunity to thank you for the good cooperation which allowed for the swift adoption of the new rules to prevent the misuse by European political parties or foundations of personal data in the EP elections. The Council conclusions set out a comprehensive approach to protect the European elections from interference such as cyber—attacks and disinformation campaigns from inside and outside the EU. A comprehensive approach is our motto. We do not want to leave any loopholes. All strands of action and all actors should be connected. To achieve this objective, the conclusions identified actions to be taken and which, indeed, have been implemented in the last month: the holding of regular meetings of the European election cooperation network, in which Member States share expertise and good practices and jointly identify threats; the setting—up and launch of the Rapid Alert System, where national contact points in Member States share information rapidly on disinformation campaigns; the enhancement of strategic communication dedicated to European values and policies; the strengthening of the European Media Ecosystem by facilitating networks of independent fact—checkers; the promotion of media and digital literacy and awareness—raising activities to protect the integrity of the electoral process, together with the private sector and civil society; the assessment of cyber—threats in the electoral context and measures to address them and preserve the integrity of the electoral system in this regard (and, following the recommendation in the Compendium on Cyber Security of Election Technology, a table—top exercise on protecting the 2019 European elections took place on Parliament’s premises two weeks ago); a call on social media platforms to invest in resources to deal in a responsible and accountable manner with election-related online activities; in the same vein, the European Council in March called for the full implementation of the Code of Practice; and finally, among this set of actions, cooperation with relevant international actors. To contribute to the efforts of countering disinformation, the Presidency launched a mapping exercise to identify the actions undertaken at national level, which demonstrated the significant efforts made by Member States to combat disinformation. The answers provided by the delegations will form the basis for a synthesis report that will feed into the discussions on the possible ways forward, including beyond the 2019 elections, foreseen for the European Council in June.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 237, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. – Mr President, this is indeed a timely debate – thanks for scheduling it. With the European Parliament elections rapidly approaching, we’re in what you might call the final straight when it comes to taking measures to ensure that they are secure. What have we been up to? Well, we’ve heard some of the things that we are doing. Briefly, to recap, over the last six months or so we’ve brought together the Member States election commissioners, cybersecurity experts, data protection experts in the reinforced election cooperation network, in order to share best practice and promote cooperation with a view to better securing our elections. We’ve set up a rapid alert system among the EU institutions and the Member States in order to spot and tackle coordinated disinformation campaigns. We have worked with this house, MEPs and the political parties to raise awareness around the transparency of particularly political advertising online as well as the security and resilience of electoral systems. Indeed, we organised a workshop with you, Mr President, in Parliament to that end. Earlier this month, as we heard, we carried out a table—top cybersecurity exercise, together with Parliament, Member States and our EU Cybersecurity Agency to check how cyber—secure. That, I’m glad to say, was opened by your colleague, Vice-President Wieland. We’ve seen the big internet platforms sign up to our Code of practice on disinformation, last summer, which was reinforced by the publication of our Action Plan on tackling disinformation in December.  Under the Code and the Action Plan, the platforms have been reporting month by month on their progress to tackle disinformation, particularly political disinformation. We recognise that there has indeed been progress, but those reports have been patchy, and they continue to show that – at least in some areas – efforts are lacking. While some credible progress has been made in the area of political ad transparency, platforms still need to improve independent scrutiny through better access for fact—checkers, researchers and civil society to the data they need. We don’t want the platforms to be marking their own homework. We want to see greater action against fake accounts and bots. We need see more quick and prominent corrections, for example, through a pilot programme of the Correct the Record initiative that’s been advocated by civil society.  We have now received the latest reports from the platforms on what they’re doing, covering the month of March and we’ll publish our assessment of those reports in the coming days. In a way, this represents a final push in areas where we can realistically still have a meaningful impact in the fight against disinformation before the EP elections. At first sight, the latest reports do indeed suggest further progress has been made, for example, in terms of transparency for political ads and indeed ads in general, but there are still some outstanding issues.  Finally, let me say that Member States’ computer security response teams are going to come together in a further exercise on election cybersecurity integrity in mid-May. That’ll be a last opportunity for us to test how robust our cybersecurity measures are in the run up to the EP elections.  One issue that I just want to mention, one of the outstanding issues that we’re dealing with the platforms, in particular with Facebook, is Facebook’s decision not to permit cross-border political advertising. I know that this has raised concerns in this House. As President Juncker said in his exchange of letters with President Tajani, this was a decision that Facebook made. There’s nothing in the Code of practice that limits political advertising to advertisers residing only in a given Member State. Obviously, it’s up to Facebook to respect the law. It’s also up to them to decide how they do so, and in this case the decision they’ve taken, the interpretation that they have given to respecting national electoral rules has raised concerns about the ability of EU institutions and bodies and Europe—wide political parties to communicate effectively in the run up to the EP elections. We discussed this in the Conference of Presidents last week and I’m glad to say now that the Secretary-General of this institution, the Council and the Commission have written to Facebook setting out again our concerns very clearly and asking that Facebook reconsider their approach in this area as a matter of urgency. We’ll have an opportunity to address these concerns direct with Facebook at an upcoming meeting that we are having with them.  I just want to say that, of course, the issue of election security will not disappear after 26 May. As we’ve heard, elections continue – indeed there’s an election somewhere in Europe every week, and so we’re going to need to continue our efforts to protect elections and our political lives in this digital age. This process is going to include a discussion at the European Council in June on an initial assessment of how the EP elections have gone. Any lessons that we learn from that on the basis of a report prepared by the Presidency, the Commission and the High Representative will be an opportunity to look ahead, learn lessons and establish a strategy for the future.  Depending, indeed, on what happens between now and the end of May, I think we should discuss how to react, how to learn the lessons and to take the necessary steps for the future. We will also review the Code of practice later in the year and look again at whether we need to do more to reinforce transparency around the activity of online platforms in this political space.  I look forward to our debate today. This is not a challenge of just the next few weeks. This challenge will not go away. We need to maintain our current push for immediate action in the run—up to the EP elections, but we also need to look further ahead, to the future, to ensure that our democratic processes remain as robust as we need them to be.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 238, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Danuta Maria HÜBNER", "mepid": "96779", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would also like to thank both the Council and the Commission for the strong commitment visible here in what they said to us. For us, elections are an important element of democracy. Compromised cybersecurity in elections can lead to the loss of confidence in the electoral system, in democratic processes and in leadership. Europeans are increasingly aware and worried about all aspects of electoral security. A recent Eurobarometer survey showed that 61% were concerned about possible manipulation of the European elections via cyber—operations. To fight against cyber—threats and ensure that the cyber—environment is safe we need a society—wide approach as well as international cooperation. In this context, amending European regulations on the statute and financing of European political parties and foundations, aiming at protecting the electoral process from online disinformation campaigns based on misuse of voters’ personal data, introducing financial sanctions on European political parties or foundations that infringe data protection rules deliberately to influence or attempt to influence the outcome of European elections, as well as the Commission’s actions to build strong cybersecurity in Europe, support and awareness at the level of the Member States, all that can help citizens to make their political choices in fair, secure and transparent elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 239, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Claude MORAES", "mepid": "4519", "text": "on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I welcome the measures the Commissioner has taken. He’s worked hard on this issue, but this is a very tough issue. Electoral interference is proven, it’s happened and it’s going to happen again. And there is a sense of urgency in all of this. When the Commission followed up Parliament’s calls on a code of conduct to stamp out the spread of fake news online and reported on the code of practice against disinformation, we looked at the progress and we saw that the Commissioner warned that Facebook still has 116 million fake accounts on its platforms. We really can’t control this spread unless we really use the tools that we have, so there is a sense of urgency. Signatories to this: it’s not just Facebook, it’s Google and Twitter, and we know that the Commission will follow up this work and we really need to act as a team to ensure that this happens. But this is about online and offline actions. This is not just about cybersecurity. So online, we have called for full algorithmic accountability and transparency. This is essential for citizens to be able to protect themselves against any manipulation and to protect our electoral processes from foreign interference. We also have to look at how political parties and campaigns are using social platforms for campaign purposes. Offline: we have to have electoral safeguards, such as rules on transparency and limits to spending, respect for silence periods, equal treatment of candidates, banning of profiling for electoral purposes, and social media platforms should label content shared by bots and speed up the process of removing fake accounts. Offline and online is important, but we also need to ensure that we understand that the General Data Protection Regulation is not the only model for protection. We may need to end the deadlock on e—privacy regulation to ensure that the rights of citizens, especially regarding the protection of users against targeting, are protected. So, we need to think about what we do about Facebook and the Cambridge Analytica scandal, using all of the tools we have here in the European Union. There are three regulators in the world: China, the United States and the European Union. I am in the European Union. I want the EU to act on foreign actors interfering in our elections.

The image was strong, but the thought short-sighted. Indeed, in the past, it was national armies that clashed. Henceforth the danger which threatens the northern continent from Vladivostok to Gibraltar is not attributable to one or more nationalisms, but to a world demographic phenomenon of telluric dimension. Civilian, the invasion of our territories is nonetheless a terrible threat to our independence, our freedoms and even our survival. We have the right and the duty to face it, with all the means necessary to overcome it. However, the European Union is today a straitjacket that paralyzes the nations that make it up, at a time when their defense and therefore their capacity to mobilize is more necessary than ever. No matter what the federalists think, there is no European nation or European people. Your assembly itself is elected by the peoples of the nations that make up the European Union. The nation is the legal, moral and political framework of all the countries of the world and their highest expression is the UN, the United Nations Organization. The nation therefore remains the most natural and effective framework for supporting and defending the peoples who have assembled there. It is from it that the national feeling, the love of its soil, of its history, the love of its homeland proceed. It is this which goes beyond and prolongs individual destinies and which is the guarantor of the future of generations. On the other hand, there is a dazzling European civilization and a concert of instincts which create the need for close cooperation of the nations of the boreal continent, beyond even just Western Europe. The demographic revolution, which in 50 years has brought the world population from 3 to 8 billion inhabitants, a number that is growing exponentially, has triggered a giant migratory phenomenon of which we are only seeing the beginnings. It threatens to submerge the boreal continent of which Europe is a part, which is itself in a demographic deficit. A huge gap is also being created between the needs and the productions of the world. The misery of the world makes this continent appear as an El Dorado, when it is little more than a raft of Medusa sinking under the weight of new arrivals. In the face of these distressing prospects, Europe is proving to be powerless. Worse, it paralyzes the national reactions which should mobilize the peoples who constitute it.

We should actually all be united in the fight against fake news, disinformation and propaganda. But I'm afraid - and this is also what Mr Telička said - that the Member States are not aware of this issue and they do not pay enough attention to the dangers that arise from that. I will continue in German, unfortunately, Mr King. The digital media environment that has emerged in recent years brings many positive changes with it. Conversely, it is also increasingly ammunitioning opponents of democracy and freedom of the press. The election of Donald Trump and the Brexit referendum have shown it: manipulation of public opinion via the Internet and social media platforms is increasing. The scale is now so great that it can influence democratic elections. These developments will also play a role and pose a problem for the upcoming European Parliament elections. Once there is a false report, it takes time for it to be refuted. Then there is the technical progress. Here, too, we cannot lag behind current developments. In addition to classic social media channels such as Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, Whatsapp naturally also plays, let's say, a questionable role. In addition, artificial intelligence will make it possible to spread false reports or propaganda in ways that were previously unimagined. If the European Union wants to protect the legitimacy of the European elections and other elections, it must recognize these developments as early as possible and take appropriate countermeasures. Europe needs a powerful, holistic strategy to respond to the spread of lies, falsehoods and the manipulation of opinions.

Of course, we see the ad hoc efforts that the tech platforms are promising, like YouTube, Facebook, Google or Twitter, but without independent oversight over algorithms, we outsource our responsibility, because without algorithmic accountability and research, no one can say for sure what the impact of technology use is on our democracy, and that is unacceptable. We must act now. For example, the US Department of Housing has filed a case against Facebook because the platform allows for the selling of ads in a way that likely discriminates. So let us begin by ensuring that what is not allowed offline isn’t allowed online either. But in order to deliver on that promise we need to investigate the collection of data and the practices of micro-targeting ads and conduct stress tests on election technology.

I’m just going to respond on two points, if that’s alright. First of all there have been a number of suggestions, particularly from behind me, that in some way the work that we’re doing to tackle disinformation is against free speech, that in some way it amounts to censorship.  I want to be absolutely clear about this. We have never suggested, we will not suggest, that it is the responsibility of someone, whether it is public authorities, still less private sector, to judge whether a piece of political speech or a piece of political information is true or false, good or bad. The measures that we are seeking to promote through the Code are measures to promote greater transparency around political debate and political speech, greater transparency around the provenance of particular pieces of information – where does it come from? – so that we as citizens can be better equipped to assess that information and form our own judgments about it.  That’s what is involved in the measures that we are promoting through the Code, to have greater transparency around political adverts, sponsored content, to tackle the problems of bots and fake accounts, to use fact checkers more effectively, to have that independent scrutiny that many of you have spoken about, so that we know what is happening on these social media platforms, to have effective corrections when some piece of demonstrable disinformation has been circulated. For me, that’s the essence of defending free speech and free debate, and it is as far away as you can be from any sense of censorship.  The second thing that I want to react to: the importance of our cyber resilience, protecting ourselves from cyber-attacks, cyber-enabled interference. This is absolutely crucial. It’s why the Cybersecurity Act that you have voted and supported is so important, the new Cybersecurity Agency and the role that goes with it. But as a number of you have underlined, this needs to be implemented. I can assure you that we will do everything we can from the Commission side to follow up the effective implementation of the Cybersecurity Act, and indeed I hope that you will also support the cybersecurity competence centres and the research into cybersecurity that is going to underpin our future cybersecurity resilience.  We have to protect our critical digital infrastructure, the plumbing of our digital lives, of our digital political debate. Which is why it’s so important that we’ve now got these measures on foreign direct investment (FDI) screening, that we’ve got measures proposed around 5G security, so that people understand the importance not just of making judgments about digital infrastructure on the basis of price and cost, but also integrating security into those decisions.

Protecting elections is at the core of defending our European values. So far, the EU institutions and the Member States have spared no efforts to ensure preparedness. We understood the need for working together, learning from each other with the exchange of information and best practices, and putting in contact authorities which in the past worked in silence.

Horizon Europe is an extremely important program for the future, with an impact on the Union's research and innovation environment for the next budget period and with an impact on the Union's economy, competitiveness and living standards. Through science, innovation and basic research, Europe can become competitive and remain at the forefront of global research and innovation, creating quality jobs. Before this debate I reviewed the key points for the European Parliament and I can say that the outcome of these negotiations - this partial agreement - is a success because: 1. The principle of excellence remains the basic principle in selecting all projects and excellence is supported and promoted throughout Unions. 2. At least 35% of the total budget of this program will be allocated to support the European Union's climate objectives, which will stimulate greener products with sustainable added value for end-users. 3. The Instrument for Small and Medium-sized Enterprises will continue as close as possible to Horizon 2020. Thus, at least 70% of the budget of the new EIC instrument will be dedicated to SMEs and the possibility to have the equivalent of Horizon 2020 for grants for SMEs. 4. The research and innovation gap at Union level will be reduced by increasing participation in Horizon Europe compared to the previous framework program for Member States with low research and innovation performance, but also by ensuring a budget of 3.3% in the future. framework program for these states in the widening component of the program. Only if we are all more competitive in research and innovation will we make Europe truly competitive in these areas. 5. Innovation elements such as the EIC - European Innovation Council - and missions will, on the one hand, contribute to increasing the competitiveness of the European Union and, on the other hand, produce tangible results for all European citizens. Five mission areas have been established: one - adaptation to climate change, two - cancer, three - healthy oceans, four - crime-neutral cities, five - food and soil health, and we look forward to selecting the first missions that will it must respond to the needs of citizens. Since the last two Framework Programs, there has been a growing emphasis on innovation - and we do not dispute its importance - but Horizon Europe must support all stages of research and innovation, including collaboration in basic research. Research is excellent and, in particular, fundamental, it is an essential element and an important condition for meeting the political objectives and priorities of the European Union. The program aims at continuous administrative simplification and burden reduction for beneficiaries. I want to emphasize that the European Parliament has been a serious and involved partner in terms of content, as well as in terms of the extremely ambitious timetable. This result will be validated by the plenary vote on this partial agreement. The results of these negotiations demonstrate a strong commitment to our citizens and our research community. I would also like to emphasize that issues that are not the subject of these negotiations, such as the budget and international cooperation, synergies, the European Parliament is committed to discussing together with a budget of EUR 120 billion - our proposal - in the future.

I think it will be a good day for Europe today or tomorrow if we vote on the program. Europe is getting ambitious. Tomorrow Europe will adopt one of the largest civil research programs in the world. And Europe is addressing Europe's citizens with the program. In the days we are discussing climate protection. This is the largest climate protection program in the world: 35% of research in Europe will be concerned with climate protection. We are concerned with people's health: we want to fight cancer, we want to fight childhood cancer in Europe. We are concerned with food safety. We are concerned with Europe's cultural heritage. We deal with new industries in Europe, such as the digital industry or the creative industry. This program is ambitious on a world scale. The programs for artificial intelligence, the ambitions with regard to the new quantum technology, the questions of digitization, the production in Europe are border areas, are future areas of European research, which are aimed both at the competitiveness of Europe and at the European citizens and their interests , their health and their very immediate concerns. This is not an abstract discussion of research policy; it is the basis of Europe. We live in a Europe of high wages. In Europe we live on a continent where we have the most social expenditure in the world. The reason we are competitive is because of innovation and research. Since the 18th century, Europe has been the place in the world where innovation and research are, where social development was the basis of what we know as today's political Europe. The European Enlightenment, the European social model, a social responsibility for freedom, for the security of people, for democracy, but also for new challenges like climate change, are expressions of this program. But we also have to be realistic about what kind of world we are in. With this program - Parliament is calling for 120 billion euros for this program - the EU is moving in a rapidly developing global competition. Among the ten largest research companies in the world - among the ten companies that do the most research - there is still a European one. There are just three of the twenty largest. Of these three companies, two are from the automotive industry. A company like Amazon spent $ 20 billion on research in 2017. That is more than the entire European Union spent in 2017. With this program, we have to see - and I believe it is an important step in that direction - that we retain our competitiveness, but also our interpretative sovereignty in Europe on very crucial issues. When we talk about climate change these days, we look at ourselves and say: are we doing enough? Are we ambitious enough? What is our contribution? But we should also be proud to say: This research program exists and it guarantees that there will be climate research at all. In America, 3,000 environmental officials have been laid off and funds have been cut. China is not over-ambitious when it comes to climate change. Europe delivers. This research program is vital. And so I would like to thank the other two institutions very much. We have delivered quickly, we have delivered in a historically short period of time, we provide security for the stakeholders, and we have shown that Europe can act together, act quickly and take on the challenges of the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 285, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Carlos Moedas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, the last time I had the honour to address this plenary was on 11 December last year, and at the time I welcomed the political consensus that emerged at the ITRE Committee – thank you, President Buzek – and the ability of going at speed and quality that was the ambition of Parliament to agree on the framework programme regulation establishing Horizon Europe and a specific programme decision, thus opening the way for the Council and the Commission to start the real negotiations.

A man 100 years ago, Albert Einstein, imagined a black hole, and for 100 years people tried to achieve and to prove that that was right, and we did it. We did it, and Europe was there, touching the button of that picture, which will make for the world things that we cannot even imagine, because even Einstein could never have imagined what he did: how much that would impact the world. I think there was one scientist there that said, ‘you know, there’s a history of science before that moment, before the picture, and there will be a history of science after that moment’. I think that, for me, if I could have described European science it was that moment. Because that moment was about open science, about open innovation, and about openness to the world: in that room that day, they were representing 200 scientists. They were representing 40 different nationalities. And so I’m extremely proud, because Horizon Europe is just about that. It is about our leadership as Europeans in science. When you think about everything that we have achieved: that we have decided that on the next programme we will have these missions that Mr Ehler referred to: missions of science that people will understand. That we will communicate with people about the things that we want to do – to cure diseases like cancer. That will link us to the people. And then the ways that we will do it in terms of the European Innovation Council and the way we will innovate on the financing and the funding for innovation. The partnerships where we decided to go for an easier way, for a less complex way of defining those partnerships. And, of course, one of the points that was so important for all of us is that while the programme is about excellence, we have also to help those that are going up that ladder of excellence, and that we owe to you. We owe it to you, to the Parliament, that we achieved that agreement; that we will put 3.3% of the budget for widening measures in the future. That is a big achievement, and I also wanted to congratulate you for that. So, by agreeing on Horizon Europe, we have sent a strong signal to the MFF negotiators about the importance of science and innovation, and it is now our common task to defend a robust budget for it. This will be the next challenge, my friends, and I count on all of you to make sure that Horizon Europe will become not only the biggest science and innovation programme ever, but also the one delivering the highest impact for our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 286, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Lola SÁNCHEZ CALDENTEY", "mepid": "125035", "text": "Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Development. - Mr President, our opinion differs from what has been expressed so far by the speakers.

From a transport perspective, carbon sequestration and digitalisation in particular are key areas for investment in European research. Thirdly, we consider it a very good solution not to have a separate cluster for transport, but to try to operate as cross-administratively as possible and to make use of energy, climate, transport and digitalisation and industry funding.

We are quite satisfied with 35% of the activities dedicated to the climate, the attention to SMEs, cultural heritage, social and human priorities. But today, at the end of the legislature, I would like to launch an appeal, leave a political reflection for a few seconds. Human civilization has always been intersected with technological innovation, starting from the first arrows, from the plow, man has used the technique to improve their living conditions. Yet, on the other hand, innovation hasn't always brought about just improvements. The Sumerians discovered that their wonderful irrigation system increased the salinity of the land, making it less fertile. The industrial revolution, with coal, brought about great development, but made the cities unhealthy. And again the mobility of mass, when a simple calculation of geometry could predict the congestion of cities. Today progress is driven by digital innovation, making real what a few years ago was just science fiction. But even here, there are already important side effects. The algorithms that impact the markets in high-frequency transactions, the pervasive control of the life and emotions of individuals, as is already the case in China. And what will be possible, for better or for worse, with robotics and artificial intelligence, even perhaps with the manifestation of singularity. So prevention is better than cure, because then reversing becomes more difficult. The nuclear threat, climate change, proves this. We need greater wisdom in researchers, among stakeholders, each at their own level, so that man, his dignity, his psychological and physical health, the stability of ecosystems are always at the center of every future technological choice, industrial and legislative. Science must be implemented, it is always important with a grain of salt. We never forget what nature has endowed us with, a natural intelligence in an analog body.

In today's difficult times, it is science that must have a strong voice. It must build bridges against divisions, stand on the side of a solid, cohesive and wise Europe. A Europe that builds its strength on knowledge, not on stereotypes and populism. I believe that Horizon Europe gives us such strength. In the EU's research programs to date, the crack on the map of Europe has been very deep. The so-called old member states obtained 90% of the budget, the new EU \"thirteen\" - less than 5%. Horizon Europe offers a historic opportunity to bridge this gap. No, we do not have to be stuck with a Europe of many innovative speeds. In the new program, we triple the budget for promoting scientific excellence in countries and regions where this excellence is lacking. We are creating new instruments that will help support the most talented scientists, regardless of their country of origin. We are offering fairer wages, but above all we are giving a political signal that European science is only strong if all of Europe works together. This is a big step. When we participated in the 7th Framework Program, the postulate to open up to talent from Central and Eastern Europe was new and incomprehensible. While working on Horizon 2020, the idea of ​​spreading excellence was developed, but with a budget below 1%, not much was achieved. Only \"Horizon Europe\" gives real chances that the best scientists from Central and Eastern Europe will not have to leave their countries. Finally, we have the tools to stop this drain. For that, I thank the Commissioner and the rapporteurs of both projects and the Romanian Presidency. But nothing happens by itself.

We must continue leading this fight from the Union, moving from words to actions. From word to action. And, in this sense, from here we have proposed that 35% of the program's funds be allocated to activities related to the fight against climate change, even going beyond the initial approach of the Commission. Secondly, the digital economy, so that the Union continues to be a center of attraction for science and knowledge worldwide. For this reason, Horizon will be the world's largest program dedicated to research and development. To guarantee our independence, we cannot and do not want to be left behind or in the hands of other powers such as the Asian giants or the United States. Finally, health.

But in this program we are also very specifically addressing the issue of CO2-free industrial production. I find it important. If we talk about climate protection, we have to talk about Europe. But we also need to talk about how we can be role models for the world. The Chinese and Indians will not follow us if we have no more emissions, but also no more industrial production. That's why I've been working with Christian Ehler and others for some time on how we can build the first CO2-free steel mill in Europe, for example. And this program also helps in very specific ways. The second point is the topic of cancer - a very personal topic for each of us, including Manfred Weber, our top candidate, who spoke in Helsinki when he was nominated that his brother had died of cancer. Manfred, Christian Ehler and I have long talked about the question of how we can spare other families this fate. We are taking very concrete steps by putting a mission on the subject of cancer forward and by addressing the subject of cancer in children even more clearly in this program.

The activities of the program must be used to strengthen the EU's scientific and technological base, meet global challenges, increase the modern strength of European industry, ensuring a combination of EU funds with private business funds. Mainstreaming the less successful Member States into the program should be a priority. It is not only cohesion policy that makes it possible to avoid the two-speed division between Europe. Knowledge convergence is fundamental to sustainable development. The key is to be more open. It is essential to increase cross-sectoral, interdisciplinary, cross-border cooperation and the creation of new research and innovation networks. Such conditions may increase the expenditure on the scientific potential of countries that are currently separated from the innovative leaders of Europe by a factor of six. There will be no innovative Europe without impetus in research on health, environmental protection, safety, food quality, energy efficiency, and support for the development of artificial intelligence serving humans. All activities of \"Horizon Europe\" should be in synergy with other funds - the European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Policy, the European Social Fund Plus - in line with regional strategies for smart specialization of research. Poland wants to act like that. This will multiply the effect and then \"Horizon Europe\" will become a development lever for everyone on an unprecedented scale.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 310, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Željana ZOVKO", "mepid": "185341", "text": "– Mr President, as the shadow rapporteur for the Committee on Development for the opinion on Horizon Europe, I already emphasised the importance of Horizon Europe for the developing countries.

We must encourage them to stay and develop these inventions close to their proximity in order for the local society to benefit from their achievement.

We cannot protect with the principle of innovation what is no longer politically defensible. But do not think that this caution will delay innovation because whenever it is a matter of privileging the public interest, as in the case of health, there are already mechanisms that allow the accelerated access to the market of these innovative products.

On the occasion of today's discussion and tomorrow's adoption of the research program, I would like to remind you again that, sadly, Europe is basically that island, probably the only place, where we can still be sure of the idea of ​​the European Enlightenment, namely the freedom of science . When you see the government decreeing not to research climate change in the United States, when you see that in China and in other parts of the world research is not so free, then we should agree to remind the program - also as a task for the future - that the fight for the freedom of science is one of the most important tasks for the European Union. And we should also see it in a global context that this European model is very important for many researchers in the world. I think it is important to re-emphasize - even in the days of Brexit - that whatever the decision in Great Britain will be - and we are very concerned about the decision in Great Britain - Great Britain naturally belongs to the European research community. We may, so to speak, portray a Great Britain of the 19th century, a political decision may have been made, but there is solidarity with the English researchers, with Oxford, with Cambridge, and we should do everything possible to keep the United Kingdom as close as possible to Europe . On the occasion of a debate in Parliament, Parliament and also the rapporteurs and also this rapporteur naturally tend to emphasize their own successes and efforts.

We have widening activities and activities under the Advancing Europe package. But we need solutions that will cause countries to leave this widening package.

Thanks to the agreement reached, we will make the European system more modern, more effective and more coordinated to ensure that only safe and compliant products and fair competition in the single market reach final consumers. Every day we come across dangerous, illegal, counterfeit products, growing numbers and which mainly affect sectors with a strong impact on daily life. 32% of toys, 58% of electronic devices, 47% of construction products do not meet the safety or consumer information requirements set by the legislation. To these data must be added the growing share of counterfeit products that affect the most manufacturing countries and which represent one of the main forms of unfair competition against many European companies. Behind these numbers and these initial considerations there is a market surveillance system that is still too inefficient, without adequate resources, without sufficient coordination at European level and not very responsive to changes in the global economy. A system where 500 national authorities operate and where there is not even a complete mapping of them, where efficient communication is lacking. In implementing the Commission proposal, we as Parliament have worked intensively on many fronts. Here I will limit myself to mentioning just a few of our priorities. One of the main added values ​​of the regulation is represented by the provisions on the so-called reference operator. For most of the products in circulation on the European market, including the most dangerous ones, there will be an obligation to have an economic operator who is able to respond in the event of non-compliance or defects in the product itself. It is no longer conceivable that there is no responsible person behind a dangerous, counterfeit or non-compliant product. We have also introduced more specific provisions to protect consumers who buy on the web, who must be guaranteed with the same level of product safety as those sold in traditional channels. We also believe that there must be greater cooperation at political and operational level between the authorities of the Member States to build common strategies and ensure a uniform and coherent system of controls. In particular, we want to eliminate the so-called “port shopping”, that is the existence of privileged entry points by dishonest operators due to the less rigidity or sometimes the total absence of customs controls. For this reason we have foreseen harmonized objectives and standards for border controls, common risk methodologies, greater coordination and mutual assistance between national authorities at the level of the European network. We have also demanded a supervisory system, where there is no longer any space for conflicts of interest between the controller and the subsidiary, nor for privileged treatment for incorrect operators. This is why we supported the European Commission's proposal to create a network of public laboratories in the European Union, which can increase the control capacity of individual Member States, based on specific competences and shared priorities. Finally, we have increased the powers available to national authorities, to carry out effective investigations and controls also in the world of the web, with reference to the most technologically sophisticated products. These are the main results achieved. I hope there is broad consensus on this proposal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 325, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am really happy to see the successful outcome of the negotiations on the regulation on market surveillance and compliance. I would like to thank all of you, the Parliament, for the support for this initiative. It is an important delivery for the single market strategy. The regulation addresses a very important problem in the single market, which is that there are too many unsafe and non-compliant products on our EU market. It is also a major step forward. It will ensure better protection of consumers and lead to a fairer single market for products in the EU. Let me thank wholeheartedly the rapporteur, Mr Nicola Danti, and shadow rapporteurs Mr Karas, Mr Selimovic and Mr Dalton. I know that it was a huge effort and I know it has not been easy to finish this file ahead of the elections. As all of us know, there are things that we would have liked to see differently so, on the first point, we will prepare a declaration on the legal basis of this regulation. On the second one, more positive, we will commit to working towards more uniformity of controls at the external borders as they are very important elements of this regulation. We will have the unique opportunity to stop unsafe and non-compliant products before they are put on our European markets. The regulation will improve sharing of intelligence between national inspectors and customs authorities as well.  On several points, the proposal, let me also underline this, was even improved. I am thinking here especially of the addition of peer reviews. This regulation will make as well a fundamental difference for national inspectors. First of all, it will give authorities better tools and powers to investigate products sold online. The regulation gives inspectors the power to deal directly with the new business actors in digital supply chains, such as fulfilment centres and online market places. Further, for many product categories, there will be a business representative in the EU. This will make it easier for authorities to obtain the information they need to verify compliance and to resolve non-compliance cases. Secondly, the regulation will improve cooperation between authorities and businesses. Preventing non-compliance is even more important than policing the market – I think that we share this view – as some businesses act in good faith but they are ignorant about the rules. The regulation provides businesses with very clear channels for obtaining information on EU product rules. Thirdly, and perhaps more importantly, it will improve cooperation between all authorities in the European Union. As you know, there are currently more than 500 market surveillance authorities across the EU so the products flow freely across our internal borders but, unfortunately, enforcement does not. The regulation requires Member States to help each other in cross—border cases. It also requires national inspectors to work closer with customs authorities. There will be EU-wide cooperation through the EU product compliance network.  Only one element is missing – the money – especially for cooperation through the abovementioned product compliance network. The money needs to come from the single market programme. I am very pleased that you have been actively engaged in securing this and I count on Parliament’s further support in that respect. To conclude, let me say that I believe that we have reached a very good compromise, a balanced compromise, reflecting the different views and different concerns of all parties. I hope you will also endorse it tomorrow. Commission Statements (in writing) \"On the legal base: The Commission takes note that the text agreed replaces the triple legal basis of the Commission proposal (Article 114 TFEU - internal market, Article 33 TFEU – customs cooperation, Article 207 – common commercial policy) by a double legal basis, through deletion of the common commercial policy legal basis. The Commission continues to consider that the triple legal basis is fully justified in relation to the provisions that regulate conditions for access to the EU market of products originating from third countries. Moreover, the common commercial policy legal basis is in line with the legal basis of Regulation (EC) 765/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 setting the requirements for accreditation and market surveillance relating to the marketing of products and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 339/93. The Commission regrets the deletion of Article 207 TFEU as legal basis of the Regulation.\" \"On the implementing act to set uniform conditions for customs controls (Article 25(8)): In order to strengthen controls on products at customs, the Regulation empowers the Commission to adopt implementing acts to determine benchmarks and techniques for checks on the basis of common risk analysis on the Union level.

One of the good things that has come with today is that it is now possible to control goods that come online from outside - from outside the EU into the EU, which is really important. A new study in Denmark shows that out of 12 toy products that were bought on an online platform outside the EU and brought in, none of the products complied with the rules. Here, with the enforcement regulation, the authorities have a much better opportunity to stop these products, check them and ensure that consumers do not have to be afraid to buy products.

We had to deal with many issues, many points and the cooperation, I must say, of Parliament's negotiating team has been truly extraordinary. At the same time, let me also thank Commissioner Bieńkowska and the Commission, because in the difficult moments when cooperation was needed, she stood by us and tried to mediate our positions with those of the Council and I thank both the Presidency in this regard. Austrian, under which I started this path, and the Romanian Presidency which has finished the path. In the final reply, I would like to say two things, the first is about financial resources. This regulation is together with the project of the Single Market program, where we have inserted the financial resources, as the Commissioner said, which are used to guarantee the legs of this regulation, they serve to guarantee operations and we hope that with the next legislature, when we go to determine this program on the internal market, confirm the resources that Parliament has put in to ensure that what we foresee in the regulation is market surveillance, which is effective in practice and, to do this, resources are also needed. Let me tell you another element, what we want to do with this regulation and what we have achieved, is to have equal treatment between European companies and non-European companies. Too often non-European companies had an ease of access without demonstrating the necessary elements of conformity of the goods they placed on the European market. This is something that helps a greater and fairer internal market between European and non-European companies and the same goes for companies that market online and offline.

Chairman! Ladies and gentlemen! We consumers love them - the online brokerage services - when we book hotel rooms, airline tickets, buy clothes, shoes, books, music and much more. Then we check the selection and prices through the online brokerage services. They open up the market for us consumers and for the companies that use them to sell goods and services. So they are good in many ways, yet they are not really regulated today, it is a bit like the Wild West. In fact, companies today have only one choice. Either to accept the terms that the online brokerage services offer them, or not to be there at all. And many times the terms you get today are completely unequal, unreasonable terms and at least quite opaque. It is not good enough! Therefore, it is also gratifying that we have succeeded in reaching an agreement to have new rules made, which means that we get much more fairness and transparency for the online platforms and for the companies that use them. Ultimately, this also means that consumers can be much more confident when using the online brokerage services to purchase products. So what have we achieved? Yes, we have not fully come to terms with it all, but we will get started and lay a foundation for legislation that will enable us to have a more regulated online market. We create significantly more transparency, and we also create demands and more fairness for the companies that use the online services. It's really important, it's really good. More specifically, we have achieved that the terms that the companies that use the online services get should be much more fair. We have made a long list of requirements that a company using an online platform must have in mind in the contract it enters into. And this is very important, because it creates much more fairness, so the company knows what it is you are exposed to or face when using a service. We have managed to get through with a lot of things. The Commission proposed that the updating of terms should be notified by 15 days, we have ensured that you also have the right to terminate your contract if you do not think that the updated rules are good enough. We have implemented a large number of strict transparency requirements on a large number of matters. Including e.g. also what it is for some terms and main parameters that are used as a basis for the ranking that one makes on the online platforms. This is very important - it is important for the company that uses the online platforms that it knows what it is that is the basis for this ranking. Ranking is important when consumers need to choose the platform. We have also ensured that business users have a minimum 30 day notice period if the platform wants to terminate their contract. We have also ensured that many of these requirements apply to search engines. We have also placed great emphasis on the fact that once these rules are to be implemented and enforced, it will be done properly and efficiently. Member countries are the ones to enforce the rules, but we need to ensure that it happens better, because otherwise there is no point in using new rules. And then we have also chosen to say that since this is the first legislation in this area, it will not be long before we have to look more closely at whether there is a need to revise the rules. Therefore, we have also made a long list of requirements for what it is for some things to be checked when we get to where we need to re-evaluate the legislation. But overall, it can be said that the good thing about this proposal is that we simply create significantly more transparency for the companies that use the online dissemination services, and we also create more fairness. A more level playing field is being created for the companies that use them, and this ultimately means that our consumers, who buy goods and services on the platforms, can be more confident that they are getting that product. they expect. So this is an important step we are taking, and at the same time, we in the EU will also be the ones setting the global standards for these platforms.This is a really important day, so I thank you for the cooperation we have had and look forward to the debate we will have tonight.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 339, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Francis ZAMMIT DIMECH", "mepid": "188906", "text": "The rapporteur was informed by the Government of the Republic of Greece.- For the President, the President intervened in the House of Commons JURI,If the fat is completely inoculated, it is possible to use it.In other cases, each of the two kernels.It is possible to produce a thick-flowered flower.For the purposes of this Regulation, the Member States shall notify the Commission accordingly.Meta jien għamilt anki konsultazzjoni f'Malta f'dan ir-rigward, smajt kemm l-Erropa trid anki tgħin iktar it-contents.Insemmi t-turimimu għaliex hawnhekk min jaħdem fil-qasam tat-turikmu jrid aċċess iktar għall-informazzjoni.Information for two people can be found in the test.", "language": "en", "original_language": "et", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 340, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "member of the Commission. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank the European Parliament and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Schaldemose, but also the shadow rapporteurs, for all their efforts and for their cooperation with a view to achieving a agreement on this file, in such a short period of time. Indeed, Parliament has helped to strengthen and shape the text of the new regulation. Your amendments will help create a fairer environment for businesses in the online platform economy. This will benefit consumers who use these platforms. There will be a clear set of rules and a more predictable regulatory environment. This in turn will build trust across borders. We would obviously like this to help platforms to develop, invest and innovate. Some of these additional provisions proposed by the European Parliament will help more than one million European SMEs, which offer their goods and services through online platforms, to reach their customers. Let me highlight the operating systems, which Parliament has filled in a potential loophole. It has been clarified that online intermediation services cannot shirk their obligations when controlling the underlying operating systems. I also welcome the introduction of a list of specific contractual conditions aimed at ensuring fair treatment between online intermediation services and their business users, and at prohibiting certain harmful practices. This will make this new regulation a powerful instrument. Many of your proposals will contribute to our main objective of increasing transparency, in particular with regard to the essential question of ranking. For example, and this was also cited by the rapporteur, in addition to online intermediation services, search engines will have to provide information on any differential treatment they apply. Businesses will now be able to resolve disputes more easily - for example, all platforms, except the smallest, will need to have an internal complaints handling system in place and use ombudsmen that platforms must identify upstream to allow out-of-court settlement of disputes. This balance takes into account the expectations of companies. The final text also strengthened the role of Member States in implementing the regulation. Member States will have to put in place measures to ensure proper and effective application of the new rules. They will also need to work with us, the Commission, to monitor and assess the impact of the new rules and share relevant information. But, of course, our work does not end here. We will develop guidelines that will provide more clarity on what information online platforms and search engines should provide on how ranking works. We will obviously work with the industry to put in place codes of conduct to complement the new rules. I am glad that the compromise we have reached preserves the spirit, the objectives and the approach of our original proposal. It strikes the right balance and allows platforms, especially European ones, to establish and develop. This is only a first step. We are already taking the lead, on the one hand with the work of the observatory on the economy of platforms - I would remind you here that our independent experts are preparing a preliminary report expected in the course of the year -, on the other hand with the revision as provided for in the regulation - there will be a rigorous evaluation 18 months after entry into force.From our side, we count on your support to continue in this process.I also hope that Parliament will approve the regulation when it comes to the vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE"}, {"id": 341, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Anna ZÁBORSKÁ", "mepid": "23894", "text": "Rapporteur of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy asked for an opinion - Mr President, internet platforms are a huge opportunity for startups, small guesthouses, family or local businesses.Thanks to them, they can start a business, employ people and provide quality services.We must ensure that the strong treat them fairly.The compromise reached goes, on some points, perhaps a little further than I originally suggested.In my draft opinion on behalf of the ITRE Committee, I have tried to keep regulation to a minimum.In my opinion, Parliament should not propose business models, but rather lay down clear rules.Nevertheless, I can support the compromise reached with a clear conscience.I thank the colleagues in the ITRE Committee who supported my vision and congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs Schaldemos, as well as our shadow rapporteur, Mr Juvin.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 342, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Philippe JUVIN", "mepid": "96884", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, one of the great successes of the European Union is obviously the single market.

So obviously, national law would be completely insufficient. If a French person books a room in a hotel in Italy through a platform that is based in Ireland, what national law would apply? Is it French law, Italian law or Irish law? We can see that this does not work and that we obviously need European rules. This is what we are doing, we are protecting European SMEs and in order to protect them, we must first offer them the protection of a harmonized and common European law in the 27 States.

In the context of the rapid evolution of digital technologies, my vision is that digitalization is the future. For this, it is necessary to create a properly regulated digital environment, in which traditional business models do not suffer as a result of the digitization process.

I’d like to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the Romanian Presidency, and the European Commission for their hard work and commitment to achieve an agreement before the European elections. We had just three weeks from start to finish of the negotiations and we focused on a single trilogue. It turned into a very long day, but after ten hours of negotiation we got an agreement. Now as some of you will be aware, this agreement was subject to further adjustment from the Commission, which had made it clear in the talks that it needed to confirm its mandate. The final text addressing dual quality was therefore tweaked, but the crucial substance remains: consumers can no longer be misled by products made to different standards but marketed as the same in different Member States. It’s not right, and the agreement we vote on tomorrow will stop those egregious breaches of consumer trust. Now I know some colleagues feel that we should have gone further, and I have tabled amendments to that effect for tomorrow. But let me be clear: if any of these amendments pass, this will collapse the entire agreement. The Council and Commission have made it clear that they are already at the edge – they can’t give any more. So if they pass, there will be no deal at all. That means no provision at all on dual quality, and there will be no updated consumer law at all – just a few weeks before an election. This will not help consumers, who are currently being misled. There will be no law coming down the track for them. It will not help consumer authorities. They would not, for example, be able to give out penalties that they need to enforce all the other consumer laws. And it would not help producers, who would continue to be undercut by competitors who flout the rules. I struggle also to see how it would meet political reality. It would risk delaying efforts to tackle dual quality for years, if not for ever. But with the agreement we have found, there is a beginning. Dual-quality products now for the first time are addressed, and in the coming years, the Commission will have to review progress seriously. Those are concrete steps of progress rather than unrealistic amendments. And we should remember that this package is about more than dual quality. There are vital improvements to the consumer protections we cannot, in good conscience, delay. And the Parliament’s demands have been met in many areas. We have banned bulk-buying of event tickets following an earlier law in the UK. This practice penalises real fans, either unable to see their favourite team or artist or forced to pay touts many times the face-value price. And this will now stop, because it’s been cheating everyone and it’s good news that we are able to ban it here. We’ve also succeeded in introducing requirements to improve trust in online reviews, marketplace ranking and the pricing of discounts – all to the benefit of the consumer. I also believe that in the internet era we should trust the informed consumer. The online world contains a wealth of information that can empower the consumer, but it needs to be genuine to be useful. Our measures on online consumer trust will make sure that consumers know when they’re getting information that they can rely on, helping them find the product that they are looking for. I'm glad that we could also get support from the Commission and the Council for a tool to build consumer awareness and use of their rights. The European consumer rights – or, as I like to call it, the ‘ECR app’ – will give consumers a single identifiable point to know their rights and easy access to the complaints procedure that will help them solve their problems. We also ensured that changes to the right of withdrawal were rejected. This is an important right for consumers and for their trust in e-commerce, and if we can adopt this agreement tomorrow, it will be just over a year from the adoption of the proposal by the Commission to the conclusion of our work. So I would like to thank the shadows again, who all helped to ensure the compromise, also the IMCO Secretariat and the Legal Services for their hard work and dedication. These rules will make a real difference to consumers’ everyday life. They matter.

It goes well beyond the Commission’s proposal on many aspects. I would like to thank Parliament for its strong push to improve consumer rights, especially in relation to digital markets. But, in addition, this directive will strengthen the enforcement of consumer rights as we are providing more harmonised sanctions with teeth. Consumer authorities in all 28 Member States will be able to fine companies harming consumers in several or all Member States up to 4% of their annual turnover. Victims of unfair practices will be equipped to claim remedies from traders, such as terminating the contract or compensation of damages. This will also facilitate out—of—court and in—court disputes. The new directive will also introduce a number of new measures to avoid misleading consumers online and to improve online transparency. We prohibit the displaying of fake consumer reviews. We require a clear indication of commercial sponsoring when it is used in the ranking of goods in market places. There will be no more fake price reductions for goods fooling consumers, and there must be a clear indication that, even if a consumer agreed to a contract which does not entail money, he has rights.  Turning now to the issue of dual quality: I know that many people in this House have been fighting against this for years. This helped to draw more attention to the issue and to bring it onto the political agenda. I am therefore proud that the Commission, in the new deal for consumers, has, for the first time ever, proposed a legislative provision on this issue so that the dual treatment of consumers in the EU will stop, and so that the new rule is the same composition everywhere in the EU.  This has been a very sensitive issue in the negotiations, and the text which is now on the table is a compromise achieved by the Council and Parliament negotiators after – and I agree with Mr Dalton – very tough but, I would say, constructive talks. We want the private sector to take their responsibilities and to end dual quality. It is now absolutely clear that they cannot cheat on the quality and sell under identical packaging foods with a significantly different composition, and this is a huge step forward. I am glad that already now, under the pressure we have imposed on them, many manufacturers have adjusted their recipes to have a single one across the EU. With further steps we made with the Omnibus proposal and following exchanges of views on this issue, I know that many other companies are working on eliminating differences. What also helps is the permanent testing which we are now doing, and which shows that there is a significant number of cheated products on our markets which have to disappear.  I expect that producers will stop differentiation. Those who continue must have justified reasons for doing so. Such traders should be in a position to demonstrate their legitimate reasons. This is why we consider that blacklisting of any differentiation as a misleading practice is not the appropriate and workable solution.  The main mechanism of the Unfair Commercial Directive is set out in Article 6, not in the Annex blacklisting misleading practices. I think that it is not less effective. Article 6 of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive (UCPD) is constantly used as a legal basis by national authorities across the EU. Most recently, for example, the Italian authorities used it to fine Wizz Air or Ryanair for misleading consumers on the real price of their tickets. The consumer protection authorities in the Member States base a lot of their cases on this article. Recently, they published the result of their action against five big car rental companies for not being clear on the real content of their services and preventing informed choices, and they will do so in the future on the illegal use of dual quality.  The Commission is going to closely monitor the implementation of this provision, and we will continue our efforts to improve the enforcement capacities of the Member States. This year again, we are proposing EUR 1 million in grants from the consumer programme on this. Furthermore, thanks to a pilot project from the European Parliament, we are going to implement EUR 1.66 million/EUR 1.2 million of grants for consumer associations to develop their testing capacities.  Finally, there is a clear revision clause in the text, and we commit to re—assessing the situation two years after the entry into force of the directive to see whether we should move to more stringent solutions.

Among these positive actions is the modernization of the platform transparency. We have achieved that the rights also apply to the so-called free services. We have made sure that better remedies are provided for consumers. And we have introduced what has not been done before in this area: sanctions for violations of EU consumer protection regulations.

Now the question is: should we throw everything we have now achieved in the trash? My group nevertheless recommends agreeing and ensuring that the review clause that we have enforced is actually used in the next parliamentary term to ensure that the rights that consumers have are actually enforced, including against them dual quality, because we cannot accept that there are consumers of first and second quality.

To several questions from the Commission about consumer discrimination and product differences in the West and East, and written statements about these differences, I received a response from the Commission that the differences are the result of consumer tastes and business strategies. Dissatisfied with such a position of the Commission, I launched, with the support of 44 MEPs, an interpellation on the differences in the declarations, composition and taste of products on the EU market. I also, with the support of colleagues, launched a proposal for a Union act requesting a revision of food legislation in the European Union and the elimination of discrimination.

For good reasons, because I think that the way I approached the solution of double food quality stemmed a bit from the fact that I am a Czech citizen, who is also sincerely annoyed when she sees lower quality goods on the shelves in her country than somewhere abroad. . Where were we a year and a half ago? I went around a number of agricultural councils, the COMPET Council, a number of Member States, and I heard very great doubts about whether the problem even existed. At the same time, I have heard voices from the European Parliament, Mrs Sehnal, Mrs Borzan, other colleagues who have been loudly explaining for years that the problem exists, that it is not a quasi-invention of someone who has no other problems, and so on. We've heard a lot. The fact that we have a directive on the table today that recognizes that the problem exists, and it is a directive on unfair commercial practices, I think that is a shift. Where were we also a year and a half ago? I had tests on the table from eight member countries, which were done according to different methodologies. I have worked very hard with representatives of the industry, food and drink industry, representatives of associations of brands and I have heard arguments: Well, the tests are used in different ways, apples, pears and so on, it can not be compared, it is not relevant, we will not deal with it. . So we have done a methodology, we have invested in it, we are now testing the second line of selected products from the Member States and we find that about twenty to thirty percent of the products have the significant differences that we are aiming for in this directive. At the same time, the methodology we have set out how inspections are to be, whether food or commercial - we are not telling states to deal with the matter, so I will call inspections - how inspections are to be sampled from different countries and compared and subject those samples to testing. We are there today, we have the methodology ready and it can be said that it can be continued according to it. To your arguments: Almette, what else was here, chocolate, ice cream, but those are the things we focus on that bothers us so much, and where we should trust those inspections to collect samples, test them, and say clearly, that less cocoa in chocolate is a ripped food and it cannot continue that milk powder instead of cream is a ripped food that must disappear from the market and so on. After all, these are the things that can be solved under this directive, these are the things that bother people. Let us trust a little more for those who monitor the market that they will go on a case-by-case basis and be brave enough to apply this new directive. Dr. Pospíšil spoke about vague legal concepts, which is, of course, a risk in any legislation. Imagine if we characterized it as fighting different quality, but it was not possible to work with quality as a concept at all. Let us realize that this is not a directive that speaks only of food, but also of products as such. By pulling the matter together as a Commissioner for Consumer Affairs, I actually spread it out to all products. By the way, we will now start making a testing methodology for drugstore goods. So we also talk about cars, building materials, a number of other products. That's why we had to define in some way what an unfair business practice is. So let us trust our inspections, please, that they will go after those cases and measure case by case fairly and sanction those things. Of course, I also deal with what is happening in my country. I know that the Minister of Agriculture wants to take the lead. The market surveillance authorities are preparing to assist with the relevant national legislation so that the matter can be put into practice. There is one more thing where we were not a year and a half ago - awareness. Mr Škripek said here that more active citizens should be involved. That is exactly what cannot be done now, because not even the citizens who annoy it and who have it only suspicious, but they have no evidence, no chains, and retailers do not know that the producer has a different composition under the same brand. This directive forces them to inform about it, and if they allow themselves to do such a thing that there are different compositions, they will have to prove why. Cheating a product is not an objective and justifiable difference. It's just not like that for me. And I believe that will not be the case for those inspections either. So for me, as you know, I have proposed stricter regulation, and I take this as a compromise, as an art possible, because, as we have heard, most Member States have been against, there are two ways. Trying to help ensure that implementation in the Member States leads to the result of getting ripped food out of the market is one thing, that is, fair and bold market surveillance. Brave in the sense that he will go with the intentions of the directive, he will not go for it, but will be consistent. Second, of course, informing citizens and retailers to look at where there is what information relates to a particular product. Of course, the third thing is perhaps the revision that has gotten there, which will really make it possible to monitor whether it is legislation that is falling on fertile ground, yielding results. But that step is being made now. If we withdrew it, we would have nothing and we would be where we were a year and a half ago, which I described here a moment ago. The constellation that we would be working on the same issue in such a concentration, both the European Parliament and the Commission - I would like to make a personal remark here that I used all the creativity and annoyance of myself as a Czech consumer and that I came up with the proposal - was not it was absolutely clear that I should be in charge, but the constellation was here. Now we should give that thing a go and monitor it and possibly revise it. For me, these are ways to work with a compromise solution so that the consumer knows it.

That is why we managed to achieve a lot on it. This is a ground-breaking agreement for dual quality, but what I don’t understand is why colleagues want to kill the whole agreement, including everything, because we didn’t get an impossible demand through. It is simply not viable to demand the same in all countries; there are different taste preferences in different countries, different raw material availability, and it is not always worse because the ingredients are different. I’ll give you an example: Coca-Cola in the UK is made with cane sugar; in Belgium and France, it is made with beet sugar. Who is being discriminated against? Please tell me: who has to lose the product they like in the industry that they have? I understand that your worry is about Eastern Europe. Well, in the Coke case, it is isoglucose, which is produced in Eastern Europe and is also the same thing they use in the US. So I ask my question again: which is the best product? Who is being discriminated against? If we passed that amendment, you would have to do this for every single product in the EU – millions upon millions of them. It is just not possible. It is also not possible to pass this amendment and go back to the negotiating table; there will be no negotiating table. The Council and the Commission have made it clear that they have given all they can, and they’ve given a lot. The time has now gone. It will also be clear to them that there was no point the Commission proposing anything on this, because the EP will take an unrealistic position, which will mean that, in the end, we have no deal. And then we will lose all of the following: what we did achieve on dual quality, on ranking transparency, on the block to the changes to the right of withdrawal, on banning bot selling, on marketplace transparency, on banning fake reviews, on price comparison services, transparency, and on the ability to levy penalties.

I actively intervened in the Regulation that gave rise to EFSA and during these years I have participated without interruption in all food legislation. Today I can say with knowledge of the facts that the European Union has the strictest food legislation in the world and that we are a benchmark in terms of food safety. I can say that our food industry is excellent, innovative and competitive, and I can say that EFSA, for which I am the contact person for this Parliament, has done a magnificent job since its creation in accordance with current legislation. However, it was necessary to update the Regulation that created it in 2002, not only because time has shown us the points that could be improved, but also because the citizens of the European Union are increasingly interested in the determination process. risk in the food chain and the transparency of scientific studies on which decision-making is based. I only have to regret that this legislation has been produced hastily, with little time to debate and under tremendous media pressure, which is not the best scenario. I think that calling this regulation \"general food law\" is a bit pretentious because it only addresses the question of transparency. We cannot forget that our food safety system, the responsibility for determining risk falls on the Authority, but risk management does not. However, I do not want to downplay the agreement we have reached; I sincerely believe that we have achieved our objective of ensuring a decision-making process, based on scientific evidence, that maintains a high level of public health and safety in the European Union. At the same time, I believe that we can generate increased public confidence in decision-making by making it more transparent. To guarantee greater transparency, citizens will have immediate access to scientific studies, support for authorization requests; that is, the non-confidential information will be published at the moment the application is considered valid or admissible. In connection with this spirit of transparency, a database will be created to ensure that companies submit all studies when they request authorization and do not leave those unfavorable to them without submitting. In addition, with this, companies that fail to comply with this obligation may be penalized. With this agreement, we have also managed to find a reasonable balance between transparency and the interests of the industry to continue promoting innovation in the food sector in the European Union; In other words, the information will be disclosed without prejudice to industrial or intellectual property rights. In addition, to prevent such information from being used for unfair commercial purposes, certain safeguards have been introduced at the time of disclosure of the information, such as traceability. With regard to the organization of EFSA, I can only be happy for two reasons: first, because from now on Parliament will have two representatives on its Board of Directors, and, second, because the participation of Member States in technical and scientific commissions. This will make scientists from all Member States more closely involved in authorization procedures. Regarding the list of confidential items, it is important that the process of manufacture or production is included as a confidential item.It is also necessary to keep innovative ideas included in confidential items.Lastly, the positive part of this agreement, which is the risk assessment, will continue to be based on scientific evidence, but, at the same time, it will improve transparency on decision-making.I only regret that the process has not been approved with those of the European Medicines Agency or the European Chemicals Agency.And I end by asking for a favorable vote for this agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 383, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, the EU prides itself on having the most robust and efficient food safety system in the world. At the same time, European citizens are more and more interested in the food they eat and where it comes from. Our citizens are understandably sensitive about risk-assessment and risk-management decisions in the food chain. So, it is not surprising that EU citizens have called for additional reassurances on the safety of their food. The findings of the recent fitness check of the General Food Law and the European citizens’ initiative in relation to glyphosate bear witness to that. But before going any further, let me first congratulate the European Parliament and the Council. The positive outcome of the interinstitutional negotiations on the Commission’s proposal for the regulation on the transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain is an important step. Both co-legislators have shown a clear commitment to this important fight, following an open intense and constructive exchange. You have managed to reach a provisional agreement on this Commission proposal in a record time of 10 months. This provisional agreement on the EU transparency rules is a significant stepping stone to meeting citizens’ expectations for more transparency in the risk assessment of the food chain. Allow me to elaborate on the agreements’ main features and briefly explain its objectives. The provisional agreement is a revision of the EU food safety system, with the focus on transparency. Greater transparency of the risk assessment process will contribute to the legitimacy of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). It will increase consumer confidence in the risk assessment system and it will ensure that EFSA is more accountable to EU citizens. With this goal in mind, the provisional agreement provides for the pro-active public disclosure of all scientific studies and data supporting a request for a scientific output. This takes place early in the risk assessment process once an the application has been considered valid or admissible. This disclosure is more closely linked with two other proposed actions: public consultation on submitted studies and the notification of commissioned studies to support application for authorisation in a database that will be established and managed by EFSA. These measures will ensure that EFSA can access the relevant scientific evidence before it drafts its scientific opinion. Enhanced public scrutiny will also serve to strengthen consumer trust in the risk assessment process. At the same time, the original agreement bears in mind the need to maintain the competitiveness of the EU food and feed sector. In order to stimulate innovation, the provisional agreement sets out safeguards for the protection of justifiable confidential information. Similarly, the provisional agreement respects existing intellectual property rights, data exclusivity rules and the protection of personal data. Not only is this a crucial ingredient in stimulating innovation, but it is also essential for the global recognition of European product safety. Furthermore, to assist applicants and, most importantly, small and medium-sized enterprises the provisional agreement introduces the possibility for EFSA to provide pre-submission advice. This advice will facilitate the better understanding of the application process and make life easier for our innovators. In order to ensure trade transparency and EFSA’s long term sustainability, Member States will be represented on the EFSA management board. The management board of EFSA will also include two members appointed by the European Parliament. As the Honourable Members are aware, this deviates from the common approach of Parliament, the Council and the Commission on decentralised agencies of 19 July 2012. The Commission will be transmitting a statement to the European Parliament regretting this deviation. Similarly, and without jeopardising EFSA’s independence, Member States will be more actively involved in ensuring the presence of experts on EFSA’s scientific panels. It is important that strong, clear messaging on risks is available to our citizens. The provisional agreement recognises this and aims to improve our communication on risks. The agreement lays the foundation for a comprehensive and effective risk-communication strategy. This will ensure that the message will be clear, comprehensive and consistent regardless of whether it comes from the Commission, EFSA or Member States. I commend the House on for its active commitment, engagement and dedication in reaching the provisional agreement. I look forward to the positive outcome of the plenary vote. Commission statements (in writing) \"The Commission welcomes the political agreement reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the proposal for a Regulation on the transparency and sustainability of the EU risk assessment in the food chain.

In particular, the Commission regrets the deviation from the Common Approach with regard to the composition of the Management Board of the European Food Safety Authority (number of members designated by the European Parliament).

We know that the subject of glyphosate is not over. That was the trigger, because glyphosate is still the subject of criticism today. We are seeing in the US right now that the concerns should be taken seriously, and we'll see what comes out of a new approval process. What we have now achieved is: There is access to all studies, everyone can look into them.

Then, in the area of ​​trilogues - Commission, Parliament and Council - after arduous negotiations we concluded a balanced agreement on 14 February. The compromise agreement, which modifies the Commission's initial proposal, was reached in a record time of two weeks, was approved by a majority of the Member States and was confirmed again in the Committee on Legal Affairs. And now the Plenary of the European Parliament has the floor. The European Union introduced the complementary protection certificate to bring and promote research in Europe. Approximately half of the patent life of a new treatment is lost during the research, development and regulatory processes, and the certificate helped to restore part of that patent life. But the market has evolved, ladies and gentlemen, and generics manufactured within Europe had been left defenseless because, during the patent period and during this complementary period of protection, they could neither produce nor store the protected products, even when it is exclusively for export purposes to third countries where protection does not exist or has expired. Meanwhile, in other third countries that do not have this additional period, they can. This means that those generic producers who decide to manufacture outside Europe have a competitive advantage in the rest of the world and, furthermore, their products will enter our market before European generics. The innovative industry, ladies and gentlemen, in Europe is key and when it comes to Europe's strategy we must inexcusably continue to defend a knowledge economy. Let's not forget that this part of our industry invests approximately € 35 billion in R&D in Europe, approves thousands of drugs and new active ingredients every year, so it is clear that our intellectual property incentive system exists, it is working to manufacture and deliver new, improved treatments to patients who need them. But the generic biopharmaceutical industry must play a key role in the performance of Europe's exports and be one of the most competitive pillars of the Union's economy, helping to restore European growth. The exception to the certificate represents an effort to achieve equity within the existing framework, to free the playing field between generic manufacturers in the Union and third countries. From now on, ladies and gentlemen, manufacturers of generics and biosimilars established in the Union will be able to manufacture these products for export purposes to third country markets where this protection does not exist or has expired, thereby helping those manufacturers to compete in effectively in third markets. This Regulation will also allow these same manufacturers established in the Union to store the products in the Member State where they have been manufactured during the last six months of protection. The aim is the entry into the market of any Member State, once the certificate has expired, thereby helping to compete effectively in the Union immediately after the protection expires. We have included appropriate safeguards so as not to weaken our commitment to intellectual property and innovation. In this sense, generic and biosimilar drug manufacturers will be required to publish and send information to the holder of the supplementary protection certificate, to prevent the industry from circumventing the exception rules, and at least three months in advance. The notification will ensure the transparency of the system and increase competition in European markets, but at the same time, the Regulation respects the maintenance of the confidentiality of particularly sensitive information. The approval of this Regulation will be of great benefit to European industry and to pharmaceutical savings. The Commission has calculated that in 2025 this will mean an increase in production of between 7.3 billion and 9.5 billion euros and the creation of between 20,000 and 25,000 jobs in the Union, as well as savings in pharmaceutical spending up to 4%. Ladies and gentlemen, this report has not been easy. We have all had to make an effort to understand the different positions until reaching a balance and a consensus.

Delivering for our citizens and being seen to do so is important. It is also important in the context of Europe’s rendezvous with its citizens next month. The Commission is therefore very happy with the outcome of your successful negotiations. Parliament and the Romanian Presidency did an excellent job. This has not been an easy fight, far from it. So I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr de Grandes Pascual, for his tireless work in difficult political circumstances and under severe time constraints. I would also like to mention the rapporteurs for the committee opinions, Mr Wölken and Ms Sánchez and the various rapporteurs. I say to Members: through your inputs you have contributed to an economically useful waiver and to a clear and balanced legal text. The robust text that you have agreed with the Council will allow EU companies to take part in, and become leaders of, the emerging global market in generic and biosimilar medicines on the basis of a level playing field with manufacturers based outside the EU, delivering upwards of 25 000 net new jobs in the pharmaceutical sector in the EU over the years ahead. And, ultimately, reaffirming Europe’s position as a hub for pharmaceutical R&amp;D and manufacturing. I will now say a few words about the main elements of the regulation on which the plenary is due to vote tomorrow. Firstly, on stockpiling, a sensitive issue for Parliament. I welcome the flexibility shown by the Council, and also by the Commission, in accepting this inclusion. Stockpiling will be allowed during the final six months of the SPC in order to better ensure day-one entry of EU-produced generics and biosimilars after the expiry of SPC protection in the EU. In addition, every five years, an evaluation will take special account of whether the provisions on stockpiling are sufficient, specifically the review clause in Article 21A of the Regulation mandates the Commission to examine, inter alia, whether the six-month stockpiling period is sufficient to satisfy the objectives of the waiver. Secondly, on the date of application, all three institutions showed flexibility. The waiver will now become an effective reality by 1 July 2022 at the latest. This date respects the dual imperative of being both legally sound and economically useful. That being said, there will be no retroactive impact on acquired rights and, likewise, the core rights in the EU of SPC holders are not affected since market inclusivity in the EU remains intact during the SPC term. In addition, there will be a transitional regime so due account is taken of legitimate expectations of right-holders. Thirdly, on safeguards. The final compromise is robust and transparent. Exceptions will be accompanied by important but proportionate safeguards. These include appropriate notification rules which come on top of the new classified medicines rules that entered into force in February 2019. But, at same time, the regulation respect the needs of makers of generics and biosimilars to keep certain commercially sensitive information confidential and it complies with our obligation to promote healthy competition both in the EU and beyond. Because in the long run that means lower prices for patients. Let me conclude. I believe you have reached a good compromise. It reflects a good balance between the various political views and between the sometimes-competing interests of stakeholders. I hope that Parliament will endorse it in the vote tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 402, "date": "2019-04-16.json", "name": "Tiemo WÖLKEN", "mepid": "185619", "text": "Rapporteur ENVI. - Madam President! First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the other colleagues, the shadow rapporteurs, for the good cooperation. It was a very demanding task in terms of time. What did we achieve with this report? I believe that with this report we are ensuring that patients in the European Union have better access to cheaper and safer medicines. We have thus finally fulfilled one of Parliament’s mandates from various reports. In doing so, we are ensuring that generics and biosimilars are manufactured in Europe that we cannot currently produce in the European Union because the legal requirements for this are not in place. We are thereby increasing the safety for the patients. Let us remember: there have been contaminated medicines in recent years, there has been a shortage of certain medicines. If we produce here in the European Union, we can assess the quality better, we can also ensure that the drugs are available here in the event of a shortage. So in that respect we have taken a real step forward. The sticking point of this regulation, however, was the so-called stockpiling, i.e. storage for the first day of the expiry of the supplementary protection certificate. And here, large parts of the company, but unfortunately also the European Commission, have tried to do everything possible to prevent this stockpiling - even though the impact assessment of the European Commission itself said that the greatest benefit is in manufacturing and exists with a stockpiling. If you don't believe that: page 42 of the impact assessment. In this respect, we argued for a long time about something that actually brought the best benefit for the patients. In the end we have been stockpiling for six months. This is a good first step, and the strong review clause gives us the opportunity to see in a timely manner whether that is really enough. I hope that we can then find really safe and good drugs for all patients in the long term.

Nevertheless, I ask the Commission to keep an eye on this new measure and review it if necessary. The patents given to the pharmaceutical industry are not just there. This is a reward for the years of work that the company has put into it before a new drug can be launched on the market. I speak here of reward, where I should perhaps rather speak of insurance. The investments that companies are putting in new medicines are enormous. For example, in order to find a new antibiotic, only one in ten thousand molecules will lead to a successful drug. Yet you will also have to research and develop the 9,999 other molecules to a certain extent. To safeguard the innovation so much needed to offer new medicines to patients, we must be careful with patents and the protection of intellectual property.

We are all aware that, when acting for the purpose of protecting the general public interest, whistle—blowers play an essential role by disclosing wrongdoing and dangers to society. Therefore they deserve legal protection. I know you discussed this yesterday in the debate on the whistle—blowers’ directive. We have all been following recent events related to Mr Assange’s case. Julian Assange took refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London in 2012 to avoid being taken to Sweden to be questioned on charges of rape, molestation and unlawful coercion. He argued that his asylum claim aimed to prevent his being ultimately extradited to the United States and put on trial for publishing thousands and thousands of classified US documents. As you all know, on 11 April, Ecuador withdrew Mr Assange’s asylum, which led to his arrest by the British police. Westminster Magistrates’ Court subsequently found him guilty on British charges of breaching bail. In addition to charges in the United Kingdom, Mr Assange currently faces charges in the United States, and the Swedish judicial authorities have indicated that investigations may be resumed into charges of rape against him. Let me clearly point out that the Council as such has not discussed the issue of Mr Assange’s possible extradition and does not have a position on it. As a matter of fact, extraditions are a matter of the exclusive competence of Member States. Therefore, the matter now lies in the hands of the British judiciary and of the UK Home Secretary. But let me take this opportunity to stress once more that the Council attaches very high importance to the protection of whistle—blowers. As a matter of fact, during the last month, Parliament and the Council focused their efforts on ensuring that an agreement on the whistle—blowers’ directive was reached before the end of the current legislative term.

Only in this way can we guarantee that Europe protects those who defend transparency and truth and those who want to express themselves in free and plural societies. With an administration like Trump's, which makes the media a target pet, Assange would never have a fair trial. The trial in the United States would be instrumental in destroying freedom of the press and expression, as organizations such as Human Rights Watch and ACLU say. Assange would be at risk of being sentenced to death. Just look at what today pity Assange's source, Chelsea Manning, under torture in prison confinement. Julian Assange made decisive contributions to reveal the truth. It revealed atrocities in Iraq and Afghanistan and other crimes in Guantanamo and secret prisons, and rot, hypocrisy and crime in successive American administrations and even in complicit governments, including in Europe. I myself benefited from WikiLeaks' revelations. The minister who accused me of cheating when I handed over to the European Parliament's Committee of Inquiry the lists of torture flights committed by the CIA and the military that were authorized by Portugal to and from Guantanamo ended up being exposed as a liar by WikiLeaks. But if Julian Assange faces criminal charges brought against him in Sweden, he must answer for those charges in the Swedish court that offers guarantees of impartiality. It must be said that we trust the independence of the courts in the United Kingdom and Sweden, but at the same time, ask them not to give in to the pressures of extradition to the United States. I do not undervalue, and I must say I am concerned, that a Julian Assange, disturbed by seven years of confinement at the Ecuadorian embassy, ​​which ended up surrendering him, violating the right of asylum granted, may have collaborated with Putin's kleptocracy to interfere in American elections and attack the Democratic Party, as Special Prosecutor Muller might point out. But it is the European courts of the Member States of the European Union that have the responsibility to try Assange and guarantee him justice, and from now on the protection as a whistleblower in line with the directive that we have also just adopted today. To protect Assange is to affirm and protect European values ​​and principles, the guarantees of fundamental rights to those accused in justice, it is to give hope to all who risk their lives for the truth, for integrity and against crime that infiltrates and even captures governments.

It is not a good idea for politicians to seek to intervene in the legal process. In fact it’s a very bad idea. The separation of politics and law is central to western democracy. In the case of Mr Julian Assange, he was taken into custody, came before a court and sentenced, because he was found guilty of jumping bail. There are entirely separate charges of hacking and the like that have been filed against him in the United States. It is these charges that are to be the subject of an extradition hearing. The hearing will take place before an English judge, and what the Council said was factually wrong: the Home Secretary does not decide. Many people, including me, have disliked and disagreed with some rulings of judges in the UK, but no serious person doubts the objectivity and professionalism of the English judiciary. Nevertheless, Ms Gomes and other colleagues want the legal process to be subject to political interference. This is my last speech in the Parliament, but I have to disagree. To debase the legal process to politics is entirely contrary not just to Western values but, Ms Joly, to all the institutions of democracy. We as politicians should leave the legal matter of Julian Assange well alone. Now, what were the original legal proceedings that caused Mr Assange to jump bail? Well, it was the European arrest warrant, and this warrant was brought not by a Swedish judge but by the Swedish prosecutor. Despite this, with the European arrest warrant there is no real defence against extradition, and this is very worrying. We hear a lot in this place about human rights, but it is the S&amp;D, the ALDE Group, the British Liberal Democrats – all the unthinking supporters of a European superstate – who are also the same people who are big supporters of the European arrest warrant.

I didn't go, because he was arrested. But I also went to that city to report the violation of his right to asylum, in front of the Belmarsh prison. The right to asylum means protection from the death penalty and comprehensive protection of rights. The asylum granted by Ecuador to Assange is not only to save him from an electric chair, but to protect him from jail for exercising the right to freedom of the press in a country where he would not have a fair trial. The traitorous government of Lenin Moreno has been sold. And he has degraded the principle of asylum that protects the integrality of the rights of the asylee, accepting a life sentence or long decades of confinement in a North American jail for someone whose crime has been to publish abuses of power and violations against humanity. The British Government is not demanding guarantees from the United States on the final non-application of the death penalty, which is why the letters exhibited by the Foreign Ministry of Ecuador, in which they affirm that their British peers cite a stipulation on non-extradition in death penalty cases do not constitute a commitment or guarantee not to extradite Julian Assange to the United States. The UK never offered any guarantee of non-extradition, and we denounce in this Parliament that Ecuador, the UK and the US coordinated the handover of Assange. What is happening, Commissioner, is very serious. It attacks freedom of the press and of expression. Assange must not be extradited to the United States.
