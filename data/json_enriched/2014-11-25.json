Madam President, this request for an emergency procedure inspires me to make three points of misunderstanding.  First, during the three weeks of conciliation on the draft 2015 budget and the 2014 amending budgets, the Council was fully mobilised by this issue. He was so mobilized that he was only able to take a position on conciliation a few hours before its closing, and it was under these conditions that conciliation failed. In a way, this issue has cannibalized the Energy and Intelligence of the Council. The second reason for misunderstanding: in the event of this operation, the Commission proposed to allocate an additional 420 million resources related to customs duties and certain other taxes, not to help settle unpaid bills but to return this sum to the Member States of the European Union. Finally, I would like to say that in this area, between retroactivity and urgency, we must choose. Since retroactivity has been chosen, there is no emergency reason.

The crisis would be halted, the financial market would be regulated, jobs would come and welfare would grow. Since then, however, things have gone in the opposite direction. Today, some 25 million people in the EU are out of work. About six million of them are young people, who thus start their adult lives in unemployment. In the wake of the crisis, social security and other social security systems have been eroded, inequalities have increased. The 2020 strategy wanted us to go in the opposite direction, but since 2008 the number of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion has increased by 10 million, so that today there are over 122 million people in Europe at risk of poverty or are already poor and vulnerable. In our discussions today, but also in the run-up to the Commission's proposal for an investment package, it is therefore important to underline that we must not forget to invest in what can take people out of unemployment and poverty. Of course, we say yes to investment in infrastructure, in research and in a sustainable climate, but we must also invest in education and in increasing the participation of women in the labour market. This requires us to build a functioning childcare system that is universal and accessible to all. We must invest in the integration and inclusion of the people who are furthest from the labour market and, of course, we must do everything to ensure that no young person has to start his life by becoming long-term unemployed. Youth unemployment has reached alarming levels today. It is now over 20%, more than one in five young people in Europe, and we did not believe that when we in this House decided on the 2020 strategy. In some cases we see more jobs being created and more being added, but, unfortunately, the increase in the employment rate has unfortunately proved to be partly the result of an increase in the very precarious and frivolous forms of employment, i.e. zero-hours contracts, bogus self-employment and involuntary part-time. What would become flexibility has become a shackle of insecurity and exploitation. Loosening and abuse of labour law rules mean that people have never really managed to get to solid ground in the labour market in recent years. Among the many who still actually have jobs, over 40% go on temporary contracts, and as many as 25% work part-time. I meet some of these young people who are basically chained to their cell phones, because what if someone calls and offers them a few hours of work. Then they can't miss that call. Thus, increasing economic growth is not in itself a guarantee of more quality jobs, of poverty reduction or of reducing social inequalities. The right political choices must be made in order to achieve these objectives. We must make the internal market work for people so that it serves the life and societies in which we want to live. The benefits of growth must be spread throughout society in order to be sustainable. Otherwise, we are sitting on a ticking bomb of inequality and people's frustration with all the consequences that this entails for both individual life destins and our democratic society as a whole. We can never compete with the world around us by having low wages, poor education, poor precarious working conditions, slave contracts, exploitation, weak trade union rights. We can only compete with being the absolute best at what we do.

You know that the review of the 2020 strategy has always been a priority of the Italian Presidency since the beginning of our six-month period, because we believe that this strategy must be relaunched and made more effective and because we believe that there is a dramatic level of economic and social crisis in Europe to which the European institutions must give faster and more effective answers, first and foremost around horizontal strategies , as is the Europe 2020 strategy.  In your question, you have raised a very large number of issues in your work, and that is at the heart of the strategy. The 2020 strategy cannot be linked only to one issue, but touches on many important issues to promote growth, to combat poverty, to create jobs. They range from energy policy to a new knowledge policy, to a sustainable development strategy. These are all issues that are linked horizontally at a time when we are talking about the new Europe 2020 strategy. We wanted to include the debate on mid-term evaluation and the identification of new priorities and the new method and within all the formations of the Council of Ministers. And already this was a choice that was not only of work organizations but is a clear choice of political approach.  We believe that all formations of the Council of Ministers must be active, proactive and should make their contribution to achieving the results of Europe 2020. We cannot continue – and this is a priority that we have generally placed on the functioning of the Council of Ministers, but which is particularly true with regard to the Europe 2020 strategy – we cannot continue to work with a compartmentalised Council. On the one hand, we cannot develop major horizontal, mainstream strategies, which touch on various policies and then have a Council of Ministers that continues to work in compartmentalised areas or that deals with Europe 2020 only in one or two Councils. No, this is the work we have to do, horizontal work. That is why we have discussed the main features of this strategy in all council formations. This work will then be continued and finalised, as you know, by the Latvian Presidency, which will follow the Italian Presidency. There are a number of sticking points from the discussions we have had in the Council. Some firm points that are first and foremost the objectives. We must maintain them and be more effective in achieving the objectives that we have set out in this strategy and that we have not achieved: growth, employment, the fight against poverty. We must be ambitious, we must be more ambitious. There are positive results in some areas, such as education. There have been totally unsatisfactory, I would say very worrying, results, not least as regards the credibility of what we are and the credibility of our work, as regards the fight against poverty, as regards the fight against unemployment. It is clear that we must move forward more decisively and more effectively. The third important message I want to give you is the issue of governance. It is clear that we also need to rethink the way in which the Europe 2020 strategy has been managed, starting with greater alignment of the Europe 2020 strategy and the European Semester. This is another point on which, in the new parliamentary term, I believe that we must make a difference together. We cannot continue in the economic, social and development field to have parallel processes that we meet and sometimes talk to each other from time to time. On the contrary, it is clear that we need to develop in a much more integrated way all those strategies which, in the economic field, tend to achieve the results that you and we want and, above all, the results of job creation and the fight against poverty.  Therefore, we certainly need to work better to integrate the processes that we have developed so far under the Europe 2020 strategy and those that we have carried out within the framework of the European Semester, and this is clearly a work for which we need more dialogue and greater interaction. We are working - some progress has been made and I believe that we need to do much more - to coordinate the work that is being done in Ecofin and the work that is being done in the Employment and Social Affairs Council. We know very well, I do not have to remind this House, that this is also due to a lack of competence, a difference in powers of competence. On the one hand, we have a process managed by the Ecofin Council within the framework of the European Semester, which is made up of binding processes and possibly also sanctions, and on the other hand we are still at the so-called open method of coordination with regard to social aspects of work.  It is clear that there is an imbalance on which we must work and we can begin to work through greater integration of the policies and priorities pursued in the social field and together with the priorities and processes that are already well regulated within Ecofin. This is certainly a very important point.  Just as it is very important – it was also raised by Mr Syley on be it – it is not a question of the european Union. Ulvskog – the theme of the involvement of the social partners. Greater involvement of the social partners is essential for the success and strengthening of the social dimension of the Europe 2020 strategy at national and European level. That is why we wanted to focus precisely on the very subject that we are discussing this morning at the trilateral social summit that we held during our presidency on 23 October. However, the process of consulting the social partners must be more lean in order to be effective. It can't have the long time you've had so far. From this point of view, therefore, we must make the dialogue between the social partners more leaner, more effective and, I would say, more interactive. We cannot limit ourselves to large summits of many hours in a day which then do not have the effect they must have in the impact on the process as a whole. The other very important issue on which we need to do more and which we have identified as a priority is the evaluation of employment and social indicators. It is certainly a step forward, it is a good starting point. Let us now give greater visibility to employment and social aspects. In addition to this visibility, more effective concrete actions will also be needed.  In the same way, we must make a much more determined commitment to gender equality. It is clear that the role of women in the labour market is part of one of those great objectives that we must continue to pursue within the Europe 2020 strategy after its review next spring. I would also like to refer to a letter signed by 22 ministers insisting on this issue, stressing the need for gender equality to be reflected more strongly in the revised strategy. We as presidency have fully supported the initiative of these 22 ministers. In conclusion, Mr President, because I want to make room and listen to the speeches, I would like to remind you of the subject of investment, the issue of growth, rehabilitation, structural reforms and investment. I am absolutely convinced that the real response to the fight against poverty, together with all the things I have just mentioned, is a new investment policy. A new investment policy which, in our view, we will see tomorrow, and the idea of the investment plan, an idea which was the view of the Italian Presidency and which Mr Juncker wanted to take on his own and which he will present tomorrow, so I cannot comment today on a plan that will be presented tomorrow. But, it seems to me, we wanted a fresh start, we wanted a whole new start. Juncker has committed to a new start, a new beginning. We believe that the investment plan is a good start, it is a positive start to develop an investment policy that must concern European policies around that plan, in particular the Europe 2020 strategy, but it must also concern national policies that must be consistent with the new choice, which we are making at European level, to aim to do what Europe has not wanted or been able to do in recent years.  What has been lacking in recent years has been an active European demand policy, active for growth, through investment. We now have this new priority and this is the real response to the fight against poverty, to job creation: public investment and private investment. Tomorrow we will have a debate in this House in which the Presidency will also take part, but this, Mr President, is certainly the most concrete, most tangible and comprehensible response for our citizens that we as the European Union can give.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 13, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, since the Europe 2020 strategy was adopted, we have indeed been moving away from the EU’s headline employment and social targets. For instance, the number of people living in or at risk of poverty has increased by more than 6 million. The economic and financial crisis has taken its toll: social hardship and the rise in equality call into question the fairness and effectiveness of our social market economy. However, the crisis should not make us overlook long-term social structural issues. It is accepted now that more and smarter investment in jobs, growth and competitiveness is needed. For this reason, the Commission will present a EUR 300 billion investment plan, which should mobilise money for much-needed projects to support job creation and improve living standards. I am happy that the Council has already welcomed this wholeheartedly. As regards progress towards the Europe 2020 targets, the modernisation of national labour markets and social protection systems is crucial. The European Semester with the country-specific recommendations is a key venue for calling on the Member States to make good on their commitments and deliver on their targets. The Multiannual Financial Framework supports this ambition. A greater share – at least 23% – of cohesion policy funding has been ring-fenced for the European Social Fund, of which at least 20% will be specifically allocated to promoting social inclusion and combating poverty. The globalisation fund and the fund for the most deprived can also contribute to the employment and social targets. They support workers made redundant to find jobs, and they help the most deprived maintain a level of decency. Both the existence and the distribution of these financial instruments were only secured with the very outspoken support of the European Parliament. The Youth Unemployment Initiative has been frontloaded in the first two years of the programming period, and we are working with the Member States to get the funding on the ground. As to the new Commission, there is an explicit agreement that employment and social policies and the related indicators need to be better taken into account in the European Semester. Indeed, they need to be better coordinated with economic and fiscal policies. As President Juncker said, social fairness is as important as the stability of the single currency and the solidity of public finances. We must – and we will – also work more closely with social partners.

I believe that the report gives a very good impetus here. Some of them come from the pen of the ECR. Firstly, we want the EU 2020 strategy to take into account and promote the potential of young people. We need the entrepreneurial courage of the young generation, who shoulder the economic and social benefits of the future. Work does not create politics, work creates small and medium-sized enterprises and entrepreneurs. Secondly, we want the EU 2020 strategy to emphasise red-tape policy even more than before, less bureaucracy. This must apply to businesses, but it must also apply to all citizens, to families: less bureaucracy, more identity. Thirdly, Europe's competitiveness needs healthy sustainable demographic development. We need young people, and young people need family. So far, this demographic factor has been far too short.

We are informed that levels of private debt among households and companies – already high in some Member States – have increased significantly during the crisis. It points to rising levels of unemployment and poverty, with the long-term unemployed – those out of work for more than one year – increasing by over 80% between 2008 and 2012. Now there are some positives in the report, in that the share of young people in tertiary education has increased and the percentage of early school leavers has dropped. But equally, the share of NEETs – at 13% in 2012 – is a major source of concern. Alarmingly, it also points out that, although significant inequalities already existed in some Member States prior to the crisis, those divergences have amplified both within and between Member States. From a social perspective it warns that, while GDP and wealth have marginally increased overall, the crisis has constrained redistributive effects. So, on my part at least, all of this gives rise to a growing alarm – even panic – at what is happening across the EU, a continent that I believe is fracturing economically and politically. Those of us who support the EU as an entity need to find ways to help and support Member States to deal with this immense challenge. Some of the challenges are fiscal – are debt-related – and while they are crucial, we are not discussing them here this morning. This morning we are trying to see how we can strengthen the employment and social aspects of the EU2020 Strategy. Even though citizens will not see an immediate impact, if we can find agreement on proposals to help Member States achieve those targets, then I believe we will have done valuable work. So that is why we welcome, for the first time, the use on the scoreboard of key employment and social indicators such as child poverty levels, access to health care and homelessness. But crucially, we ask that the scoreboard be used as an early warning mechanism in order to develop suitable policies, otherwise we are just number-crunching, we are box-ticking, and that is less than useless. We also ask that employment and social considerations be put on a par with macroeconomic ones. I personally support this proposal. I know there are issues about a legal base, but I want to ask the Commissioner: What is your view on this, how do you see the possibilities of rebalancing the economic and the social, how can we make it real rather than just talking about it? This is not just about spending money. Yes, we will have the details of Juncker’s package tomorrow, but we need to be sure first of all that it is growth-friendly investment, and secondly that there is a redistributive effect from this growth. So I am asking the Commissioner: How specifically do you propose to deliver on those objectives? I was interested to hear the Council speaking earlier about integrating the 2020 objectives into the European Semester. You said yourself there is an imbalance there. We need to see how to get rid of that imbalance. Finally, job creation is crucial, and in that, ALDE strongly supports the elimination of bureaucracy and unnecessary burdens for SMEs. But equally, we must target decent jobs.

Madam President, Commissioner, Mr Representative of the Council, there is no point here in multiplying the rhetoric of lamentation which in fact reveals the failure of European policies: they must be changed.  Social objectives must stop being wishful thinking and the remnants of economic policies; on the contrary, economic efficiency stems from choices of social and ecological efficiency of human well-being. We cannot hope to make progress towards more jobs without a development project, without getting out of austerity, without a credit policy of the European Central Bank that must first serve the real economy and work. Experience shows that flexible work does not create jobs, it develops social insecurity and creates poor workers. The future of a new human European project depends on debate and decisions here to invent a system of security in employment and lifelong learning, with a top priority for young people. Similarly, we will not reduce poverty without defending public services, without improving social protections instead of destroying them, without a minimum income within the European Union and without the incentive to create a guaranteed minimum wage in each country.  The reorientation of the 2020 strategy must be clear in order to consider education, social protection, public employment services as priority investments, the preservation of the climate and the ecological transition of productive systems as priority guidelines, which should no longer be taken into account in budgetary calculations on deficits.

If we are not bearing all three parts in mind, as our resolution recalls, we are not actually going to be moving forward, because it is that integration and cooperation which gives us that direction. We are also very clear that the search for growth is not an end in itself. It is more about political choices to reduce inequalities and to tackle poverty. The benefits need to be spread throughout society and not just concentrated in the hands of those that are already rich. It is clear that we are moving away from what, in our view, were already pretty unambitious poverty reduction targets. But it is also clear that work in itself is not the answer. If you look, for example, at the report of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which was published yesterday in the UK, 50% of those in the UK who are in poverty or at risk of poverty are in work. Social security benefits are important; they are a key stabiliser, and they actually give people a base from which to be able to move forward. As others have also been saying, the quality of work – decent work, a job you can build a life on – is also a key element of a job-rich recovery and this strategy. So we do need to look at the abusive practices that we have. We need to look at the way in which people are working many, many hours and still actually cannot afford to live a decent life. It is not enough for us to end the biting austerity measures – which have had such a destructive effect on so many lives – if we are not engaged in a socially-just transition which is going to tackle inequality and move us towards a low-carbon economy, which is also part of the EU 2020 strategy. The issue of bureaucracy and administration costs for businesses is important, but removing that does not necessarily give you a better society with decent work either. You have to look at the outcome of what you are doing. We very much welcome the Council’s words about the balancing of the social and economic dimension, because we think that the reaction to the financial crisis has been one of stand-alone economics and that it has not taken into account the need to actually develop people’s lives. So, yes, we would agree that new investment is needed, but we should not forget – as the Commissioner has said – that we need to make the money that we are already spending through the structural funds – including the social fund – work properly. Parliament has an oversight role there too. And finally I also very much welcome the words of the Council on the reference to governance.

That is why it is necessary to break up work and income, and that is precisely what citizenship income is for.  In Italy, we in the 5-star Movement have proposed a citizenship income that we want to export to Europe, so that a minimum monthly fixed income is a right of any European citizen. This is not a welfare measure but a form of legal civilisation that pays for itself and that guarantees the weakest at a time when work can no longer do so. Many European countries have already implemented such a measure, but in Italy our proposal has been mocked.

We note, however, that the five ambitious objectives set for 2020 are education and social inclusion, which have been the least attention to the Union institutions and the Member States, and which, on this floor, will hardly be achieved by 2020. The truth is that, so far, the strategy for exiting the crisis has met fiscal consolidation criteria, leaving behind measures aimed at stimulating economic growth.  In this battle, social cohesion and the fight against unemployment are the main victims. Iniquity between Member States is clearly visible and continues to increase. Europe cannot continue to operate at two speeds. We have to create more jobs, we have to put an end to job insecurity, we have to create more decent jobs, the internal market has to be a reality for the future of Europe. We can't wait any longer. It is imperative to implement the programme for jobs, growth and investment that Mr Juncker will present in this House tomorrow.  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe has to invest more vigorously in the areas of physical and human capital, innovation and technological development, and this necessarily involves more effective support from the Union for the Member States.  There is a new generation that feels it has no future in Europe. They finish their school run to thicken the unemployment queues. Europe is getting old, its young people are fleeing and they will rejuvenate other continents. Ms Thyssen rightly said that the funds for globalisation and for the most unprotected have to be more carefully managed. That's true, but that's just not enough. We must provide the business fabric of the Member States with effective support mechanisms and instruments.

There are currently over 24 million unemployed in the EU. More than one in five young people are unemployed and in some countries youth unemployment is over 50%.

Yes, some people even have two jobs, but they still can't afford the day and the road.  Today, more than 122 million people in the EU are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. For particularly vulnerable groups such as people with disabilities, the poverty rate is 70% higher than the average. Inequality between rich and poor is on the rise. In 2012, the top fifth earned five times as much as the bottom fifth. In other words, this is not a success story.  If jobs are to be created for people to live on and if poverty is to be combated, it requires, first and foremost, a showdown with the eu's current policy. This requires a showdown with the EU's policy of cuts, with the EU's one-sided focus on competitiveness. This requires a showdown focusing on economic growth, without the recognition that the whole of society should benefit from growth.  There's other buns on the soup. We need better and more jobs at the heart of it, and we must recognise that labour markets and welfare communities are very different in EU countries.

I come from local politics, and I would like to tell you how much I have seen the Europe 2020 objectives as progress, especially in my daily work compared to the previous Lisbon Strategy. Quantifiable targets for employment, for equality, for education, for the fight against poverty: the importance of these issues cannot be overstated, and I think that brings us a considerable step closer to economic and social cohesion in Europe and is an important contribution to a more social Europe. Because I believe that the citizens need this social Europe. We need a social union, especially as a counterweight to economic and monetary union. It is precisely the citizens who must no longer see Europe as a vehicle for austerity or the assertion of neoliberal interests, but must also see Europe as a guarantor of social rights and their personal social rights. However, as we have heard, the reality is different. There is record unemployment, life-saving jobs are already becoming a luxury, women are often deported to involuntary part-time work, and in many Member States young people are already talking about a so-called lost generation. This is an alarming state of affairs. I am not really surprised that we are sitting here today talking about the failure to achieve the Europe 2020 targets. We have a fundamental design flaw in the whole matter. Anyone who believes that austerity can combat poverty or create jobs must go astray, and that must fail. We need a holistic approach to reform, a change of course away from austerity policy, a reform of the Stability and Growth Pact and a rethinking of our crisis-fighting policy to date, which has not actually fought the crisis at all, but has exacerbated it even further, especially for the most vulnerable. I think that this resolution, which we are adopting together today, is a very important step, because it brings a holistic, broad approach to combating poverty, how to create sustainable growth and green jobs. There is also talk of a reform of economic and monetary union, of the importance of public services, of the need to involve civil society in social Europe.

Employment and social affairs are one of the key elements of the Europe 2020 Strategy, which aims to ensure inclusive growth. We stand by efforts to secure employment for 75% of the European Union's population aged 20 to 64, reduce the share of early school leavers below 10%, and reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and social exclusion by at least 20 million.  But at the same time, we realize that Europe's biggest scourge remains unemployed young people. In March 2014, there were nearly 5,340,000 young people under the age of 25 unemployed in the European Union. We cannot expect young people to participate in Europe's political life when they are unemployed. Among other European Union mechanisms, small and medium-sized enterprises are one of the main tools for successfully tackling youth unemployment. They have significant job creation potential and play a crucial role in the transition to a new sustainable economy. That is why I would like to emphasise the need to create an environment conducive to small and medium-sized enterprises by providing easier access to credit, removing unnecessary administrative barriers and, of course, the need for their connectivity and internationalisation. I therefore call on the European Commission: - to promote mobility mechanisms, in particular the European Job Mobility Portal. A number of studies have shown that mobile labour brings benefits to both parties. The European Commission estimates that 2 million jobs in the European Union cannot be filled due to low mobility; - to support the formation of cooperation with the private sector, as well as to ensure the link between education and the labour market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 35, "date": "2014-11-25.json", "name": "Inês Cristina ZUBER", "mepid": "111589", "text": "   Madam President, we cannot really be surprised at the non-achievement of the targets set out in the 2020 Strategy.

We all know, or at least those who go through this, the thousands and millions of young people in Europe know that every contract with a precarious relationship has as its horizon more or less immediate an unemployment situation. Recent studies by the European Commission confirm: part-time work and temporary contracts have increased and make up a large part of so-called new jobs.  But let us be honest, is that not the real objective of the European Union in order to satisfy economic monopolies? It is that, if it is not, they have to explain why it was precisely the recommendations to the countries in the framework of the European Semester, as well as the troika memoranda, as the European Commission itself confirms, to impose changes to collective procurement systems in at least 12 countries in recent years.

In his candidacy speech to us in the European Parliament, Jean-Claude Juncker called for social fairness not to be neglected. Agree! We must weigh the social impact of structural reforms. But it would be wrong to play off social objectives against the consolidation of national budgets. The rebalancing required must not call this principle into question. I consider the introduction of an EU unemployment insurance scheme to be problematic. Taxpayers cannot be financially involved for the unemployed in other countries. We do not have a single labour market, we do not have collective agreements valid throughout Europe and we do not yet have a central EU employment agency. We are against a transfer union.

It is therefore urgent to reinvest, because this is what it is all about: an investment in the social dimension of the Union, which must necessarily move from the relaunch in the European Council of that social pillar (as defined in the document of the four Presidents) towards a genuine economic and monetary union, as well as the review of the Union's spending policies within the framework of the mid-term review of the multiannual financial framework. It is a disgrace that the last financial framework was cut for the first time in history, given the circumstances. The situation of the debate on the 2015 budget, which is still stalled, is also depressing. New instruments will therefore have to be put in place to deal with the increasingly obvious socio-economic polarisation from which our economy is suffering, both within the individual Member States and at European level. In order to have a social Europe of triple A, it is necessary to create automatic stabilization mechanisms capable of dealing with these macroeconomic and social imbalances.

In the resolution voted on today, we highlighted the consequences of neglect in employment and social policy. The omissions that often resulted from the struggle to balance national budgets, which were severely affected by the crisis. Social policy spending is ad hoc and, although necessary, does not bring about long-term change. It is social investment and forms of activation of excluded groups that are expenditure that brings results and benefits, including financial ones, but takes time. The problem is that in times of crisis we do not make long-term investments. For example, we are not investing in ambitious youth education, as this will only bear fruit in a decade. In times of crisis, we think here and now. We forget that a lack of social investment will lead not only to the loss of generations, but to the great impoverishment of European society. The growing problem of poverty is an example that we need to be aware that rapid economic growth does not reduce poverty, despite such a general belief. People who are in poverty need long-term action and assistance to get out of poverty, and economic growth is no longer affecting them, as they are already out of reach of the wave of benefits and employment.  We have many good solutions in Europe, examples where responsible policies, particularly in terms of activating society, bring single-digit levels of unemployment and low levels of poverty.

There are a number of reasons for this situation, which vary from country to country, and therefore there cannot be a single European solution. One of the fundamental reasons is the lack of childcare solutions. Most mothers don't work or work part-time either because they either lack childcare services or are too expensive.  Only a few Member States have managed to achieve the pre-school childcare target. Based on their experience, the solutions are: 1. provide childcare facilities that better reflect parents' working hours, 2. provide childcare allowances, 3. amend childcare leave laws, 4. provide for flexible working hours.

Agriculture and related industries, such as timber production and furniture, or energy production from biomass and biogas, can create a number of permanent and seasonal jobs.

More than five million young people are out of work in the EU, more than 27% in Hungary. One of the most pressing problems in the newly acceded countries, including my own country, is also linked to youth unemployment: economic emigration due to lack of prospects. Nearly half a million young people in Hungary have already decided to emigrate. Mass emigration causes not only emotional but also social and economic difficulties. And what you may not see and understand in Western Europe: not just the countries concerned. According to the latest statement from the Institute for the Future of Work research in Bonn, five million citizens of the Eastern Central and Eastern European countries that have joined the EU since 2004 currently live in western EU countries. According to the researchers, this process can adversely affect the health and quality of life of the hungarian population. One of the important values of the European community is the free movement of labour, which must be preserved.

Twenty-six years ago, Pope John Paul II addressed the European Parliament. His speech was a milestone on the road to the fall of the Iron Curtain and the beginning of the reunification of Europe. Today, Pope Francis, you are speaking to a European Parliament whose members represent more than 500 million people from 28 Member States. Members of this House represent the diversity of Europe. Over the past six years, Europe has experienced a dramatic and unprecedented crisis. This crisis has serious consequences. The loss of trust in people in their institutions, at national and also at European level, is particularly dramatic. This loss of confidence is enormous. Without trust, however, no idea, let alone an institution, can survive permanently. That is why the cooperation of all forces is necessary in order to regain the lost trust. In this respect, the concerns of the European Union and its institutions and those of the Catholic Church go hand in hand to a large extent. The values of tolerance, respect, equality, solidarity and peace are part of our common mission. The European Union stands for each other rather than against each other, for inclusion rather than exclusion. Young people are struggling to find work and their place in our society, migrants are looking for a better future for themselves and their children, people are fleeing wars and disasters and are seeking asylum and protection here. Whether it is the issue of social justice or the unequal distribution of wealth and life chances, whether it is about the situation of old people in our society, or whether it is about wars and conflicts in our neighbourhood and beyond, we face common challenges. Your holiness, your words have enormous significance. Not only because you are the religious leader of more than a billion Catholics. Your words are extremely important because they concern us all, because they are also addressed to all of us and are valid for all of us, because the issues you raise affect us all and concern us all. These themes are universal. Her words provide orientation in times of disorientation. Their messages of peace and dialogue, sincerity and responsibility for each other, solidarity and coexistence clearly show us that we must solve common tasks together, that we are stronger together than alone. Their message is a very European message. It is precisely on this message that the idea of European unification is based. And your history, your holiness, is a European story. The story of a family that has left Europe and found a new home in South America. It is the story of a pope who returns from the other side of the Atlantic, from the other side of the world, to reform his Church and lead the faithful. It is a story that can serve as a model for us and help Europe to renew and reform itself. I thank you, on behalf of all my fellow Members, for being with us today and for accepting and following the invitation of the European Parliament. It is an honour and a privilege for this House to be able to listen to you today. Your Holiness Pope Francis, you have the floor.

I would like to express my particular gratitude to you, Mr President of Parliament, for the warm words of welcome you have addressed to me on behalf of all members of this House. My visit comes more than a quarter of a century after that made by Pope John Paul II. Much has changed since those days in Europe and around the world. There are no longer the opposing blocs which then divided the continent in two, and the desire is slowly being made that 'Europe, by sovereignly giving itself free institutions, can one day extend to the dimensions given to it by geography and even more by history'. Alongside a wider European Union, there is also a more complex and highly moving world. An increasingly interconnected and global world and therefore less and less \"Eurocentric\". A larger, more influential Union, however, seems to be accompanied by the image of a Europe that is somewhat aged and compressed, which tends to feel less protagonist in a context that often looks at it with detachment, mistrust and sometimes with suspicion.  In addressing you today, starting from my vocation as pastor, I would like to send a message of hope and encouragement to all European citizens. A message of hope based on the confidence that difficulties can become powerful engines of unity, in order to overcome all the fears that Europe - together with the whole world - is going through. Hope in the Lord who transforms evil into good and death into life.  Encouragement to return to the firm conviction of the founding fathers of the European Union, who wanted a future based on the ability to work together to overcome divisions and to foster peace and communion among all the peoples of the continent. At the heart of this ambitious political project was trust in man, not so much as a citizen, nor as an economic entity, but in man as a person with transcendent dignity. First of all, I would like to stress the close link that exists between these two words: 'dignity' and 'transcendent'.  \"Dignity\" is the key word that characterized the recovery of the second post-war period. Our recent history is characterized by the undoubted centrality of the promotion of human dignity against the multiple violence and discriminations that have not been lacking in Europe over the centuries either. The perception of the importance of human rights arises precisely as the result of a long journey, also made up of multiple sufferings and sacrifices, which has helped to form the awareness of the preciousness, uniqueness and unrepeability of every single human person. This cultural awareness is based not only in the events of history, but above all in European thought, characterized by a rich encounter, whose many distant sources come \"from Greece and Rome, from Celtic, Germanic and Slavic substrates, and from Christianity that has shaped them deeply\", giving rise precisely to the concept of \"person\". Today, the promotion of human rights plays a central role in the European Union's commitment to promoting the dignity of the individual, both internally and in relations with other countries. This is an important and admirable commitment, because there are still far too many situations in which human beings are treated as objects, whose conception, configuration and usefulness can be programmed, and which can then be thrown away when they are no longer needed, because they have become weak, sick or old. Indeed, what dignity exists when there is no possibility of freely expressing one's thoughts or of professing one's religious faith without constraint? What dignity is possible without a clear legal framework that limits the domination of force and makes the law prevail over the tyranny of power? What dignity can a man or a woman ever have, the subject of all kinds of discrimination? What dignity can a person who does not have the food or the bare minimum for living find and, worse still, who has nothing but the work of dignity?  Promoting the dignity of the person means recognising that he has inalienable rights of which he cannot be deprived of any arbitrariness, let alone for the benefit of economic interests.  However, care must be taken not to fall into some misunderstandings that may arise from a misunderstanding of the concept of human rights and their paradoxical abuse. In fact, there is now a tendency towards an ever-increasing demand for individualism – I am tempted to say individualistic – which conceals a conception of a human person detached from every social and anthropological context, almost as a \"monad\" (μονάς), increasingly insensitive to the other \"monads\" around him. The concept of law no longer seems to be associated with the equally essential and complementary concept of duty, so that we end up affirming the rights of the individual without taking into account that every human being is linked to a social context, in which his rights and duties are linked to those of others and to the common good of society itself. I therefore believe that it is very vital today to deepen a culture of human rights that can skilfully link the individual, or rather, personal dimension, to that of the common good, to that \"we-all\" formed by individuals, families and intermediate groups that unite in a social community. In fact, if everyone's right is not harmoniously ordained to the greatest good, it ends up conceiving itself without limitations and therefore becoming a source of conflict and violence.  To speak of the transcendent dignity of man, therefore, means to appeal to his nature, to his innate ability to distinguish good from evil, to that \"compass\" inscribed in our hearts and which God has imprinted in the created universe; above all it means looking at man not as an absolute, but as a relational being. One of the diseases that I see most prevalent in Europe today is loneliness, which is the very loneliness of those without links. It is particularly evident in the elderly, often left to their fate, as well as in young people without reference points and opportunities for the future; you can see it in the many poor people who populate our cities; you can see it in the lost eyes of the migrants who came here in search of a better future.  This loneliness was then exacerbated by the economic crisis, the effects of which still persist with dramatic social consequences. It can also be seen that, in recent years, alongside the process of enlarging the European Union, public mistrust of institutions considered distant, committed to establishing rules perceived as far removed from the sensitivity of individual peoples, or even harmful, has increased. In many quarters we get a general impression of tiredness and ageing, of a europe that is a grandmother and no longer fertile and lively. So the great ideals that inspired Europe seem to have lost its attractiveness, in favour of the bureaucratic technicality of its institutions.  This is associated with somewhat selfish lifestyles, characterized by an opulence now unsustainable and often indifferent to the surrounding world, especially the poorest. It is regrettable that technical and economic issues prevail at the heart of the political debate, to the detriment of a genuine anthropological orientation. The human being is in danger of being reduced to a mere cog in a mechanism that treats it as a consumer good to be used, so that – as we often note – when life is not functional to this mechanism it is discarded without much hesitation, as in the case of the sick, the terminally ill, the abandoned and careless elderly, or children killed before they are born.  It is the great misunderstanding that occurs 'when the absolutization of technology prevails', which ends up creating 'a confusion between ends and means'. Inevitable result of the \"culture of waste\" and \"exasperated consumerism\". On the contrary, affirming the dignity of the person means recognizing the preciousness of human life, which is given to us free of charge and cannot therefore be exchanged or disposed of. You, in your vocation as Parliamentarians, are also called to a great mission, although it may seem pointless: to take care of the fragility of peoples and people. Caring for fragility says strength and tenderness, says struggle and fecundity in the midst of a functionalist and privatist model that leads inexorably to the \"culture of waste\". Caring for the fragility of people and peoples means preserving memory and hope; it means taking charge of the present in its most marginal and distressing situation and being able to aage it of dignity. How, then, can we restore hope to the future, so that, starting with the younger generations, confidence can be restored in order to pursue the great ideal of a united and peaceful, creative and enterprising Europe, respectful of rights and aware of its duties? To answer this question, let me use an image. One of Raphael's most famous frescoes in the Vatican depicts the so-called School of Athens. At its center are Plato and Aristotle. The first with the finger pointing upwards, towards the world of ideas, we could say to the sky; the second extends his hand forward, towards the one who looks, towards the earth, concrete reality. It seems to me to be an image that well describes Europe and its history, made up of the continuous encounter between heaven and earth, where heaven indicates openness to the transcendent, to God, who has always distinguished European man, and the earth represents his practical and concrete ability to face situations and problems. The future of Europe depends on the rediscovery of the vital and inseparable link between these two elements. A Europe that is no longer able to open itself to the transcendent dimension of life is a Europe that slowly risks losing its soul and also that \"humanistic spirit\" that it also loves and defends.  Precisely starting from the need for an openness to the transcendent, I intend to affirm the centrality of the human person, otherwise at the mercy of the fashions and powers of the moment. In this sense, I consider fundamental not only the heritage that Christianity has left in the past to the socio-cultural formation of the continent, but above all the contribution it intends to make today and in the future to its growth. This contribution does not constitute a danger to the secularity of the States and to the independence of the Union's institutions, but to enrichment. This is shown by the ideals that formed it from the beginning, such as peace, subsidiarity and mutual solidarity, a humanism focused on respect for the dignity of the person. I would therefore like to renew the readiness of the Holy See and the Catholic Church, through the Commission of European Bishops' Conferences, to have a fruitful, open and transparent dialogue with the institutions of the European Union. Likewise, I am convinced that a Europe that is able to treasure its religious roots, knowing how to grasp its richness and potential, can also be more easily immune from the many extremisms that are rampant in today's world, not least because of the great ideal vacuum we are witnessing in the so-called West, because \"it is precisely God's oblivion, and not its glorification, that generates violence\".  We cannot fail to mention here the many injustices and persecutions that affect religious, and particularly Christian, minorities in different parts of the world on a daily basis. Communities and persons who find themselves subjected to barbaric violence: driven from their homes and homelands; sold as slaves; killed, beheaded, crucified and burned alive, under the shameful and complicit silence of so many. The Motto of the European Union is 'Unity in Diversity', but unity does not mean political, economic, cultural or thought uniformity. In reality, every authentic unit lives on the richness of the diversity that makes it up: as a family, which is all the more united the more each of its members can be fully self-fearless. In this respect, I believe that Europe is a family of peoples, who will be able to feel close to the institutions of the Union if they are able to skilfully combine the ideal of unity that they yearn for, with the diversity of each one, enhancing individual traditions; becoming aware of its history and roots; freeing himself from the many manipulations and phobias. Putting the human person at the centre means first of all letting it freely express its face and creativity, both at the level of the individual and at the level of the people.  On the other hand, the peculiarities of each one constitute an authentic wealth inso far as they are put at the service of all. We must always remember the european Union's own architecture, based on the principles of solidarity and subsidiarity, so that mutual aid prevails and we can walk, animated by mutual trust. In this dynamic of unity and particularity, you, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, also have the need to take responsibility for keeping alive the democracy of the peoples of Europe. There is no hiding the fact that a homologous conception of the whole world affects the vitality of the democratic system by de-strengthening the rich, fruitful and constructive conflict between political organisations and parties. So you run the risk of living in the realm of idea, of speech alone, of image, of sophisma... and end up confusing the reality of democracy with a new political nominalism. Keeping democracy alive in Europe requires avoiding so many \"globalizing ways\" of diluting reality: angelic purisms, the totalitarianisms of its kind, atoric fundamentalism, ethicalism without goodness, intellectualism without wisdom. Keeping the reality of democracies alive is a challenge of this historic moment, preventing their real strength – the expressive political force of the peoples – from being removed in the face of pressure from non-universal multinational interests, weakening them and transforming them into uniform systems of financial power in the service of unknown empires. This is a challenge that history presents to you today. Giving hope Europe does not only mean recognising the centrality of the human person, but also promoting its skills. It is therefore a question of investing in it and in the areas in which its talents are formed and bear fruit. The first area is certainly that of education, starting with the family, a fundamental cell and a precious element of every society. The united, fertile and indissoluble family brings with it the fundamental elements to give hope to the future. Without this solidity we end up building on sand, with serious social consequences. On the other hand, emphasizing the importance of the family not only helps to give prospects and hope to the new generations, but also to the many elderly people, often forced to live in conditions of loneliness and abandonment because there is no longer the warmth of a domestic hearth able to accompany and support them. Alongside the family are educational institutions: schools and universities. Education cannot be limited to providing a set of technical knowledge, but must promote the more complex process of growth of the human person as a whole. Today's young people are asking to be able to have adequate and complete training to look to the future with hope, rather than disillusionment. Europe's creative potential in various fields of scientific research is also numerous, some of which have not yet been fully explored. We need only think, for example, of alternative sources of energy, the development of which would greatly benefit the protection of the environment.  Europe has always been at the forefront of a commendable commitment to ecology. In fact, this land of ours needs continuous care and attention and everyone has a personal responsibility to preserve creation, a precious gift that God has put in the hands of men. This means, on the one hand, that nature is at our disposal, we can enjoy it and make good use of it; on the other hand, however, it means that we are not the masters. Keepers, but not masters. We must therefore love and respect it, while \"instead we are often guided by the pride of domination, possessing, manipulating, exploiting; we do not \"custody\" it, we do not respect it, we do not consider it as a free gift to take care of\". Respect for the environment, however, means not only avoiding disfiguring it, but also using it for good. I am thinking in particular of the agricultural sector, which is called upon to give support and nourishment to man. It cannot be tolerated that millions of people in the world starve to death, while tonnes of food are discarded from our tables every day. Moreover, respecting nature reminds us that man himself is a fundamental part of it. In addition to an environmental ecology, we therefore need that human ecology, made up of respect for the person, which I wanted to recall today by addressing you. The second area in which the talents of the human person flourish is work. It is time to promote employment policies, but above all it is necessary to restore dignity to work, while also ensuring adequate conditions for its implementation. This implies, on the one hand, finding new ways of combining market flexibility with the need for stability and certainty of job prospects, which are essential for the human development of workers; on the other hand, it means promoting an adequate social context, which is not about the exploitation of people, but about ensuring, through work, the possibility of building a family and educating children.  Similarly, the issue of migration must be tackled together. We cannot allow the Mediterranean Sea to become a great graveyard! On the boats that arrive on European shores on a daily basis, there are men and women who need reception and help. The lack of mutual support within the European Union risks encouraging special solutions to the problem, which do not take into account the human dignity of immigrants, encouraging slave labour and continuing social tensions. Europe will be able to cope with immigration issues if it is able to clearly propose its cultural identity and implement appropriate legislation that can at the same time protect the rights of European citizens and guarantee the reception of migrants; if it is able to adopt correct, courageous and concrete policies that help their countries of origin in socio-political development and in overcoming internal conflicts – the main cause of this phenomenon – instead of the policies of interest that increase and fuel these conflicts. It is necessary to act on the causes and not only on the effects. Mr President, Excellencies, ladies and gentlemen, awareness of one's own identity is also necessary in order to engage in a proactive dialogue with the States that have applied to join the Union in the future. I am thinking in particular of those in the Balkan area for whom the in the European Union will be able to respond to the ideal of peace in a region that has suffered greatly from the conflicts of the past. Finally, awareness of one's identity is indispensable in relations with other neighbouring countries, particularly those bordering the Mediterranean, many of which suffer as a result of internal conflicts and the pressure of religious fundamentalism and international terrorism. It is up to you legislators to preserve and grow the European identity, so that citizens can regain confidence in the Union's institutions and in the peace and friendship project that undersoes it. Knowing that \"the more the power of men grows, the more their personal and collective responsibility is extended and expanded\". I therefore urge you to work to make Europe rediscover its good soul.  An anonymous author of the second century wrote that \" Christians represent in the world what the soul is in the body\". The task of the soul is to support the body, to be its conscience and historical memory. And a two-thousand-year history links Europe and Christianity. A story not without conflicts and errors, even sins, but always animated by the desire to build for good. We see it in the beauty of our cities, and even more so in that of the many works of charity and common human edification that support the continent. This story, for the most part, is yet to be written. It is our present and also our future. It is our identity. And Europe is in great need of rediscovering its face in order to grow, in the spirit of its founding fathers, in peace and harmony, since it itself is not yet free from conflict. Dear MEPs, the time has come to build together the Europe that revolves not around the economy, but around the sacredness of the human person, of inalienable values; Europe, which boldly embraces its past and looks with confidence to its future in order to live its present fully and with hope. The time has come to abandon the idea of a Europe that is afraid and bent over itself in order to arouse and promote Europe as a protagonist, bearer of science, art, music, human values and even faith. Europe that contemplates heaven and pursues ideals; the Europe that looks at, defends and protects man; europe that walks on the earth safe and firm, a precious point of reference for all humanity!

The aid is necessary as the Finnish authorities argue that the global shipping industry has changed significantly in recent years and that, in this global context, the EU's share of the shipbuilding market has decreased. In many Asian countries, shipbuilding has become an industry that creates jobs and receives foreign currency. Due to the global nature of the shipbuilding industry and the impact on employment, this industry is supported in Asian countries. As a result, Europe, where the modern shipbuilding industry is created, has transferred a significant part of the market to Asian countries with lower labour costs.

A total of 565 beneficiaries are affected by the application. The Finnish authorities argue that the global maritime sector has changed dramatically in recent years and that, in such a global environment, the EU's market share in shipbuilding has fallen sharply. Asian countries have acquired a significant share of Europe, the cradle of modern shipbuilding, where labour costs are low. The Finnish authorities argue that, following the closure of the STX, the unemployment rate in the Rauma region is expected to rise by more than 2 percentage points from 11.1% to 13.1%.
