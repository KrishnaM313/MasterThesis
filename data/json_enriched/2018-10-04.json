It is time to take stock of their implementation by the Member States. What is going well and going wrong in the application of European rules. We agree that, for the proper functioning of the internal market, it is crucial to define a comprehensive and strategic policy framework for public procurement that promotes growth, jobs and innovation. In our economy, public procurement represents a substantial part of public investment. More than 2 billion euros a year. This means that 250,000 public authorities use about 14% of the Union's GDP to purchase services, works and supplies through public procurement. We know that the provision of high-quality public services depends to a large extent on modern, efficient and transparent procurement processes. The report under discussion today responds precisely to this need. We agree with the European Commission's strategy of proposing a package of non-legislative measures, two communications and a recommendation on the professionalisation of public procurement. We don't need more laws, but a good implementation of the laws we have. That is why we have a number of recommendations which the Internal Market Committee wants to see implemented. Ladies and gentlemen, the directives adopted in 2014 are not only an instrument for regulating the public procurement of goods, services and works. They should contribute to Member States promoting policies on innovation, green economy and circular, sustainable and inclusive growth. We regret, however, the disappointing pace at which many Member States have transposed the Directives, even leading to infringement procedures, and we are aware that many of the criticisms point to a protectionist nature, the difficult access and understanding for small and medium-sized enterprises, the comparatory and the little transparency and the fact that the only award criterion appears to be the lowest price , rather than, for example, strategic social and environmental criteria for communities. My report therefore proposes, among other measures, that, where possible, and if justified, quality criteria be adopted in place of the lowest price criterion, paragraphs 12 and 13. The participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in public procurement is supported by, for example, stimulating batch division, paragraph 38. Transparency instruments such as contract registers, paragraphs 29, 33 and 41, are introduced. Invest and accelerate digitization at all stages of the procurement process, paragraphs 26 to 33, and promote innovation, paragraphs 4, 23 and 24. National procurement strategies, systematic analysis of data and professionalization plans for agents dealing with public procurement, paragraphs 53 to 57 should be developed. Unfair competition is being fought in cross-border procurement procedures and improving access to public procurement markets in third countries, paragraphs 45 to 49. High standards of ethics and deontology are applied at all stages of the process, paragraphs 15 and 20. In conclusion, Mr President, I sincerely thank the shadow rapporteurs who have worked so closely on this report and for the opinions drawn up by the ENVI and INTRA committees. I believe that we have come to a good report, which sets out the right approach to efficient, effective and competitive public procurement, which responds to the challenges facing the sector today and makes a strategic contribution to achieving objectives such as innovation, social inclusion and economic and environmental sustainability.  I count on the support of all colleagues for the final adoption of this report which promotes the smooth functioning of the single market, business growth and employment and protects the interests of citizens.

Public procurement is a very important subject. You have heard the data and you have heard the numbers, but at the same time, besides the data and the numbers, this is a powerful tool which can help carry out policy. We are not using the full potential of public procurement at the moment. Taxpayers are often still not getting the best value for money and do not see results that provide them with the best public services.  That’s why we decided last year – almost a year ago, in November last year – to adopt a public procurement package because we feel that we need a major shift in the culture of public procurement (PP). But at the same time it is also important, as you have heard, that this package is not new legislation. It is made up of voluntary measures, recommendations, suggestions, some new ideas and best practices. It calls for a wide partnership, but also for political ownership of this topic. The package is our attempt to jointly steer the political discussion on PP, to identify priorities and to offer tools for implementing them. We also underlined the role that public procurement can play in responding to European competitiveness and to societal environmental innovation challenges because we know that, for example, it can encourage energy and resource efficiency investment. It can foster innovation and facilitate social inclusion.  We specifically addressed the importance of selecting the most economically advantageous tenders based on a cost effectiveness approach to get the best value for public money for all our citizens, but – as was said before – the most economically advantageous is not always the cheapest. It can never be underlined and repeated enough that EU law does not require the lowest price as the only award criteria. The package shows how the possibilities offered by the Public Procurement Directives can be used to support wider EU policy objectives. It contains practical measures and guidance along with implementation support from the Commission. So we recommend some actions and offer assistance at the same time.  We organised the package around six priorities. Let me briefly list them. The first one is ensuring wider use of innovative, green and social procurement, then professionalising public buyers – there we need the right competencies and skills of the people who are dealing with this topic – increasing access to procurement markets for SMEs and all EU businesses, though of course SMEs are at the centre of our interest, improving transparency and integrity, delivering better data, boosting the digital transformation of procurement, using technologies to simplify and to reorganise procedures, and cooperating more between authorities at different levels, to procure together. In March the Council endorsed the package and underlined its importance for European competitiveness. In February we also discussed this package in the Ecofin Council to show the importance of good procurement for public budgets. We definitely know that improving the way procurement is carried out and focusing on the professionalisation of public buyers can really generate important savings in Member States’ budgets.  The Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions have also adopted their opinions so I am very glad that today Parliament will complete this interinstitutional cycle and adopt the own initiative report. I appreciate that this has been done after a thorough debate with contributions from many of you, under the really valuable leadership of Mr Coelho, together with the shadow rapporteurs. You have prepared a good report, which largely supports the Commission’s proposed approach, while at the same time giving us food for thought for the future. I am also happy to see that there is a large degree of consensus within Parliament and substantial agreement with the Commission’s view on some specific issues.  I will mention just three or four of them. First SMEs, as was underlined before. I would caution against too much pessimism. There is not a big share of SMEs participating in the public procurement market, and as the directive has only been recently transposed I think it will take some time before the simplification really takes effect. We have launched a recent study to identify the possible remaining barriers to SME participation in procurement.  The second point is on quality criteria – what else? – and strategic procurement. Here the situation varies enormously between the Member States. In many there is still a lot of scope to increase the use of quality criteria. We believe that spreading the word that clarifying the lowest price is not mandatory at all, and obtaining high—level commitment to that principle is extremely important. I also think that we should make it easier to apply green, innovative and social procurement. That’s why we are updating existing guidance and compiling best practices to assist authorities incurring tenders. I would also like to stress that we fully share the views of the report when pointing at the huge benefits that digitisation of procurement could bring. The last point is on the professionalisation of public services, first through more cooperation and exchange of good practices. On this point I couldn’t agree more. We have launched an e—competence centre and a web page bringing together all guidance and good practice from different Member States. We are developing a European competence framework for public buyers to make sure that the skills competences they require are clearly identified.  These are the main points. Thank you very much for taking this subject on board.

Indeed, we are still in a situation today where public procurement markets in third countries are often de jure and de facto closed for competitors from the European Union.

The Commissioner said: yes, the challenges and problems for SMEs in particular when it comes to the international dimension must be taken seriously and taken seriously. A key problem on the road to better market access is, on the one hand, multilateral agreements, and above all the government procurement agreement. However, regardless of this, better market access as the core interest of the European Union remains an important element of our bilateral trade talks. And the CETA agreement, as well as the EPA with Japan, are actually successful examples of this, which should continue to be included as pilot projects, as an important element for further negotiations.

And it is a good moment for me to point out that the thresholds that we have in the European Union, which are also set in Germany, are not set by the European Union, but are derived from the Global Procurement Agreement, and should therefore be made clear that the European economy, unlike some Presidents of the United States of America, does not see Europe first as the centre of attention. , but wants to ensure a certain openness of the markets, so that our companies in other markets in particular can hope for the same openness. In the long term, Commissioner, they should not only be able to hope for this, but we must put even more pressure on them to ensure that other countries actually open up their markets as much as we have opened up our markets. The report by Mr Coelho, which I very much welcome, clearly shows, in my view, that there is really no reason in the Member States that 55% of contracts are still awarded on the basis of the lowest price alone, because with the Procurement Directive and the 2014 reform, we are actually offering quite a lot of opportunities for the contracting authorities, at whatever state level. , have created to make the best offer in the end eligible. That is why I urge all contracting authorities – not only in Germany, but throughout Europe – to think carefully about the conditions that will be included in the call for tenders in order to actually get the best offer in the end and not to complain afterwards that the cheapest offer has been taken again and that certain legal difficulties arise in the aftermath. I believe, Commissioner – as you rightly pointed out – that with digitisation in the area of public procurement law – and Portugal is a shining example here – we can still create a great deal of flexibility and transparency.

The report, for which I thank Mr Coelho and our rapporteur Marc Tarabella, provides a comprehensive overview of the state of transposition and implementation of these rules, but also of the most urgent issues to be addressed at European and national level.  I would like to focus on three points, the first: we must continue with the application of quality criteria in the award of contracts. All too often, unfair competition, a lack of attention to sustainability, social inclusion and disability are hidden behind a low price.  Secondly, we must take note of the fact that European SMEs and social economy companies only win 45% of the value of contracts, which is clearly at odds with their real weight in the economy. Concrete measures will have to be taken on this issue, including, for example, compulsory batching, combined with better assistance and training for small and medium-sized enterprises.  Thirdly, in parallel with the construction of the digital single market, we must also change the pace of the process of digitising public procurement. We need simplified procedures, less bureaucracy and more transparency. Finally, I would also like to mention the issue of reciprocity in the field of international public procurement. The opening up of our public markets must not make us forget how difficult, if not impossible, it is for European bidders to enter third-country markets.

The potential of public procurement is obviously enormous. 250 000 public authorities in the Union spend around 14% every year of our GDP – nearly EUR 2 000 billion each year on purchasing services, work and supplies – and still, this enormous potential is not fully achieved. There are three reasons for that. Firstly, because Member States have been very late in transposing the 2014 directives on public procurement – so late that the Commission had to initiate infringement procedures against some of them, and, unfortunately, I do suspect they will again be late transposing for the next round of deadlines, notably regarding e—procurement.  Secondly, Member States’ authorities on a national, regional and local level are not using public procurement strategically. That’s why I urge them to not consider public procurement as an administrative burden, but a way to promote a smart, sustainable and inclusive growth, to force innovation to help SMEs to gain new markets, create new jobs.  Thirdly, because the practitioners of public procurement need further education. Those directives are indeed complicated and Member States should therefore organise training in order to get it right in public procurement and open university courses to develop public procurement studies and public procurement law.  That’s why I welcome all the action proposed here, all the strategies taken by the Commission, and I wish to remind everybody that an effective public procurement will lead to taxpayers’ money being better spent in the Union.

First, of course, congratulations to the rapporteur on an excellent report.  It is true that public procurement can be an excellent tool for achieving a number of policies, and this was also the purpose of public procurement, not only in the economic, but also social, labour-legal, including environmental, including health, gerontology, in the area of demographic change. And, of course, public procurement has shown a lot of good things, but also some negative ones. What is bad is that the European Commission is also assessing as much as €2 billion in corruption in public procurement, which is decisively too much, and here the national authorities must act decisively. And in some areas, too, public procurement has previously been seen as a burden or an obstacle rather than a major advantage, and one such thing is food, especially food for our most vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly and patients. And in this part, I think we should take a step forward, be more bold, because if we provide healthy, locally produced food for these most vulnerable populations, we have big effects. Firstly, we greatly improve the health picture of our population, less food waste, limit unfair practices, shorten the way from forks, preserve and develop the countryside and create higher self-care and, of course, new jobs. These are the effects that are easy to measure, and which actually speak of the fact that if we take into account only the lowest price in public procurement or, above all, put health and price on the scale after that, then it is clear that we must give first place or, of course, health. I therefore think that this procurement package should seriously consider whether it is precisely in the area that we should take into account the taking of excluding food from the public procurement system, because I think that is also what we are obliged to do to our people to ensure a higher quality and health.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 8, "date": "2018-10-04.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  I would like to inform colleagues that, because of a technical problem, the list of speakers, as shown in the electronic tables, does not list the names in the correct order.

Traditional rules meant big business swooped in and took huge local government contracts. The legal complications and expense in placing tender bids has squeezed out local competition. In my own borough of Thurrock in South Essex, residents were surprised to see the new gas maintenance provider had its head office in Liverpool. It’s as if there are no good quality local providers anymore, and big businesses consume all and leave nothing in their wake.  Procurement rules need to change to stop this, and Preston Council is showing just how to do it. It is prioritising contracts based on localism and keeping money in the local economy. Research from the Federation of Small Businesses has shown that, for every pound spent with a small or medium sized firm, 63 pence is respent locally – that drops to 40 pence or less with a large or multinational company.  Before Preston changed the way it looked at procurement, only one pound in twenty stayed in Preston. Surely we would be better off with local solutions to contracts and tendering wherever possible. From my own experience as a councillor, we would be better off with local maintenance contracts: people who live in the same community they look after making repairs.  The government may well say that austerity is over, but there are choppy waters ahead. Councils can prepare for this now by thinking differently about procurement, keeping money local in dividing up contracts to ensure money stays with local firms, and small businesses can help prepare for uncertain times ahead.

This is the worst possible way to spend money, because when a person spends his own money for his own needs, he spends it efficiently and sparingly, and when he spends someone else's money on someone else's needs, he spends it inefficiently and un sparingly.

If we withdraw, we will not have to use public procurement and bother with dishonest officials. Corruption cannot be perched. All the shortcomings of public procurement cannot be reassid. If we apply the lowest price criterion, then it has the advantage that it is objective and it is always possible to check which price was the lowest. If we apply other criteria, social criteria, you may soon find that it is a fellow official, no one as well meets these social criteria as he does. So we get involved in the likelihood of corruption.

The report notes that the number of tenders with only one bid increased from 14% to 29% between 2006 and 2016. So, to put it another way, one third of all tenders result in a provider being available. I find that very, very alarming as a figure, frankly. And when you consider why, you have to take note of the fact that it may also be too much effort for SMEs and for small and medium-sized enterprises to participate in tenders. We have now built a new school in my home community. Here, too, we were above the threshold of five million. In other words, we advertised throughout Europe and we had only one provider. And I can tell you that the disillusionment with the public authorities is, of course, immense. You advertise across Europe, a huge effort without end, and then one or from the region applies for two. One wonders: do we have to put everything out to tender throughout Europe? What do I mean by that? On the one hand, I would like to stress that public procurement must also take into account the interests of public authorities and the burden. And I would be very pleased if we – not now, not in the near future, but at the next revision of the rules on public procurement – we would also discuss the thresholds again. I think the instrument is very good. We need transparency. We must allow fair competition in public tenders. But it is not acceptable that a third of all tenders should ultimately be completely ineffective. We need to think about why.

It must therefore grieve the very poor pace of implementation of the 2014 Directive. Today I would like to point out a number of important issues relating to public procurement. First, there is an absolute need to strengthen the quality criteria in relation to the price criteria, it was mentioned. And it's about the entire lifecycle of a product or service, not just quality at the start when we place an order. Nowadays, it is also necessary to take into account the pace of change in technology and technology. Not only that, I would say that public procurement should not only respond to technological changes, but also stimulate new developments.  And what is perhaps most important is that we should reduce public procurement bureaucracy and increase the flexibility of public procurement. The contracting authority, but also the contractors, must have the opportunity to react to the change in the conditions for performance of the contract, and we often have a situation – precisely now, when there is, for example, a large development and a decrease in the supply of labour – that labour costs increase, the price of raw materials, semi-finished products, etc., increases, while flexibility does not and cannot be changed. A lot of performers are just coming off the construction sites.

Firstly, the 2014 directive, in my view, is extremely general, evisionable and allows there to be a very large difference in national public procurement legislation in the Member States. And now we are dealing with some very big things and I do not know, Commissioner, how we can solve them with the new package. For example, appeals. The challenges greatly prolong the spending of the money that we are supposed to spend in order to have an immediate effect of that investment. There is no very clear definition - who can and when to appeal, as we define the person concerned, because a boutique cannot challenge an auction for a road infrastructure.  Then the lowest price - discussed here - does not apply and the Commission has done this analysis: over sixty per cent of purchases are not at the lowest price.

I want to reiterate that the reason we decided to adopt this packet is not because we have bad legislation. The legislation is new, the legislation is fresh, and we think this is good legislation. What is bad is the implementation. This is in response to those of you who are saying that there is not enough flexibility: the legislation gives a lot of flexibility and room to manoeuver. Of course, laws must be obeyed, but it gives quite a lot of room for manoeuver, for example, for social services, from the possibility of exclusion via a light regime to integration of all of the social criteria in tendering. For this specific topic, we are preparing some guidelines on social public procurement to help Member States.  We also share with you the opinion that the digitisation of public procurement is extremely important. On the one hand, it will substantially improve transparency, for example, regarding late payments. On the other hand, we see in the Member States that have implemented e—procurement, that it has increased the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises in the process. Only a few Member States have introduced such an option, but the Commission advocates for the full cycle of public procurement.  Concerning the local level. Many of you mentioned this, and I fully understand it. I had a lot of personal experience with public procurement. Let me tell you, it is not European legislation that is a huge burden for them. The burden is the gold-plating: these are additional things added to the legislation during the transposition process. This is a problem. This is a serious problem everywhere in Europe, and that’s why we decided that this is not the moment for thinking about any changes in the legislation. But in this partnership that we want to create, this exchange of views and guidance, it’s sometimes fear that really stops people from taking the right decision. They just don’t know, they do not have enough skills and they just don’t know how to do it.  Some of you mentioned the late transposition of the directive: the largest deficit in such statistics that we have is in Germany, because the state of transposition is very late. Therefore, we do not have statistics on how it works on the ground.  Let me just add that since the adoption, we have implemented an ex—ante tool for large investment projects. This has already launched a very concrete service to help public buyers to apply the rules and to avoid problems while tendering for really big sums on infrastructure projects. We have disseminated several hundred examples of good practices on professionalisation. We have published our innovation guidance document, but as I said, the next one will be on the social topic and social public procurement.  I’m strongly committed, both to the subject and to the topic, and I am strongly committed to maintaining this discussion with you, because this topic is really worthwhile.

Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Bienkowska for the references she made and what she said. Start by stressing what she has mentioned now. We are dealing with a clear case in which Europe has done well, where we approve our legislative framework in time and where the problems result from the slow and sometimes wrong transposition of legislation by the Member States. We can't ask ourselves for more. We have to ask the Member States not to undermine what we have been able to do at European level. I would like to thank all my colleagues for their contributions and to underline three points: firstly, I think there is a great consensus on the great objectives of this initiative, the idea that, with this instrument, we will promote more transparency and fight corruption, we will ensure fair competition and we will have instruments to pursue objectives of innovation, ecological economy and circular and sustainable and inclusive growth , the idea that we also have to have social criteria here.

As always, we remain very attentive to the human rights situation in that country. At the same time, we believe that progress in a variety of fields can be better achieved by means of enhanced cooperation.  In this context, EU—Belarus relations have come a long way over the last two or three years. We have witnessed the proactive participation of Belarus in the Eastern Partnership. Here we see, of course, the resumption of the EU—Belarus sectoral dialogues and the signature of the Mobility Partnership in October 2016. People—to—people contacts, including youth exchanges, are also developing through the EU programmes, such as Erasmus+ and Horizon 2020, as well as Belarus’ accession to the Bologna process. We are now close to finalising the joint Partnership Priorities – which will be the first document of this kind between the EU and Belarus – an important building block in our relations, setting the strategic frame for our cooperation in the coming years and in which human rights and freedom of media issues play an important role.  We have recently observed an increased willingness by the Belarusian authorities to engage constructively with the EU on the human rights dialogue, including during our last meeting on 17 July in Minsk. Our support for an involvement of civil society will remain an essential part of our policy. The extensive agenda of this dialogue covered also the concerns on the freelance journalists in Belarus and the lack of legislation in this field. However, this increased willingness for debate has unfortunately not yet led to measurable legislative improvements in the human rights situation, notably on the freedom of media. In response to the new draft law on the media, the EU used the opportunity of the human rights dialogue to reiterate again the importance of freedom of expression and independence of the media. We called for unrestricted access to the internet. We are very much aware that several independent media organisations are working hard to achieve meaningful results in promoting critical thinking and democratic values, and we value their work very much. The EU at the highest political level has underlined to the Belarusian authorities that repressive actions against independent media, including the Charter 97 website, are contrary to the international commitments made by Belarus. We have equally called for the introduction without delay of a moratorium on the death penalty and the need to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. As we further pursue our policy of critical engagement, we will continue to follow closely developments in Belarus with regard to fundamental freedoms. The EU stands ready to assist Belarus in meeting its obligation in the area of democratisation and full respect for human rights. In addition, the EU will continue to provide financial support for civil society through the relevant EU programmes and initiatives. Steps taken by Belarus to respect fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and human rights will remain key for the shaping of EU policy towards Belarus. Let me also add one sentence.

But of course we’re not here to give the UAE any PR advice. We are here to condemn human rights violations when they occur. Mr Mansoor has been recognised as a courageous human rights defender.

Around USD 1 million have been invested in an Israeli-made digital surveillance system to track Mr Mansoor and his communications.

Not only did he face repeated death threats, physical assaults and detention, but he has been denied access to a lawyer, his visitation rights have been suspended and he has allegedly been subjected to torture.

Nevertheless, of course, concerns remain in a number of areas: freedom of expression and association, the right to a fair trial, and the situation of human rights defenders, including individual cases, are among the points we have raised consistently during our dialogue. We continue to advocate a cooperative and transparent engagement in which the EU can support the UAE in its endeavours to fulfil its international human rights commitments.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which is a very important one. China's Communist leadership is establishing an extreme police state in Xinjiang, detaining hundreds of thousands, if not more than a million, Chinese citizens of Uighur and Kazakh nationality. The reason given is that terror must be combated. I say that anyone who thinks that they can fight terror through general repression is really only making sure that there is enough water in which the terrorists can swim as fish. If you want to fight terrorism, you have to look at the experience of South Tyrol or the experience of Northern Ireland. I find it remarkable that, while China is gaining strength as a country, the Communist Party of China feels so weak that it does not even respect its own laws and respects religious freedom to its own citizens. I find it remarkable that China's leaders, while promoting the Chinese dream, are suppressing the current dreams of their citizens, at least if they do not want to dream in step with the BATon of the Communist Party of China.

We are deeply concerned about credible reports pointing to a serious deterioration of the human rights situation there. In addition, the recent concluding observation of the EU Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination merits close attention. This expresses alarm about reports of mass detention, political re—education camps affecting Uyghurs and other minorities, mass surveillance, travel restrictions, and Uyghurs abroad being returned to China involuntarily.  These findings present serious grounds for concern. The EU calls on China to engage constructively with the Committee recommendations. We have received accounts from EU citizens of Uyghur origin in the EU, who report being pressurised to return to China or to provide information about their relatives there. Travel documents of family members in China have reportedly been confiscated or not issued to prevent people from leaving. There are legitimate concerns about the security of Uyghurs and other people belonging to minorities if returned to China.  The EU urges all countries to consider carefully requests for international protection from such people and, where applicable, to ensure respect of the non—refoulement principle.

From now on, every time the Delegation of the European Union or one of its Member States at the United Nations hinders progress towards the treaty, every time they put buts to human rights, we will remind them that today, 4 October, the European Parliament has made it clear: voluntary corporate responsibility initiatives do not work, we must go further and create legislation and there must be sanctions for those who do not comply. There are no more buts that are worth it.  I am also addressing the Member States. The European Parliament, that is, the representatives who have chosen your citizenship, are asking you to support the treaty. If you don't, you'll be failing this same citizenship because you're not representing it. Spain, as a member of the Human Rights Council, has an opportunity to make a difference. I therefore hope that the Government of Pedro Sánchez will be actively involved in Geneva, that it has a voice of its own to defend the treaty and that it will not hide behind the delegation of the European Union, as the Government of the PP did.

So-called professional farms with more than 5,000 broilers now cover 90% of the total broiler population in Europe. But the global expansion of intensive poultry farming is not just a question of animal welfare, it is a question of human health. Broiers typically breed tens of thousands of pieces in one space without daylight access, without any enrichment of the environment, without any possibility of meeting the normal needs of those animals. Problems of the musculoskeletal system, dermatitis, deformation, pain, stress, inability to manifest natural behavior are just examples of problems that these animals face during their lives from transport to slaughter. Indeed, it is literally appalling what we, as residents of 21st-century developed countries, tolerate as normal economic practice. If the public knew where the animals were, I believe most people wouldn't be willing to eat meat at all. Over the past 80 years, broiler life spans have decreased to an average of 49 days, while increasing their slaughter weight by 100%. Can you even imagine? Since hatching at 2.7 kilos in less than two months? But these experiments with nature are already out of the hands of producers, and that should interest even those who are not interested in animal welfare. The poor health of broilers in industrial farms is forced by the preventive use of antibiotics in order to prevent epidemics and the spread of diseases. According to statistics, around 70% of all antibiotics in the EU are used in agricultural livestock production, especially in large farms, and most of it is used for bulk feed or water medication. This method of using antibiotics then leads to the emergence of resistant and multidrust-resistant pathogenic strains. Some strains of Campylobacter, Salmonella and Escherichia are now showing this resistance, and more are being added. If we don't start addressing this global problem in time, we risk trouble with our own health care system. We have no effective substitute for conventional antibiotics, and the loss of this tool would push our health system literally back a hundred years. The fact that poultry farms are, among other things, a major source of ammonia pollution looks like a mere trap alongside the problem of antibiotic resistance. I believe that we should carefully assess the impacts of large-scale production and promote more sustainable farming methods, and in this context we would like the Commission to answer the following questions: Will the Commission take measures to improve the enforcement of the Broiler Directive, in particular as regards the systematic and consistent use of animal-oriented indicators? What measures does the Commission intend to take to promote alternative chicken production systems – such as those that choose more suitable breeds, lower stocking intensity, enriched environment, access to daylight, etc. – given that such systems can help reduce ammonia emissions and reduce the need for non-critical use of antimicrobials and improve animal welfare? When will the Commission publish a report on the socio-economic impacts of mandatory labelling methods?", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 136, "date": "2018-10-04.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "  Mrs Bie-kowska, we are very much looking forward to your reply.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 137, "date": "2018-10-04.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I took this point on behalf of Commissioner Andriukaitis, but I have to tell you that I am personally very interested in the subject too. I am very concerned about animal welfare and so I am happy to be here with you.  The EU is a major global producer, as was said, of broilers. The poultry sector employees over a quarter of a million people in Europe, with 23 000 large broiler farms in Europe. But of course for us the most important thing for now is discussing animal welfare, and bird welfare.  Over the years, there has been good work in this House on that issue, and I thank you very much for this. The European Union has developed a range of legislation, which is leading the world on animal welfare. Our farmers, in each of the 28 Member States, put this legislation into force almost every day. We take animal welfare very seriously and remain fully committed to constant improvement through the life of the directive and other legislation. We work closely with the Member States to ensure that the legislation is fully enforced. This includes the directive on the protection of broilers, the Broiler Directive. Since coming into force in 2010, the Broiler Directive has provided a legal framework to the Member States, which has considerably improved the management and housing of broilers. This in turn has improved the welfare of the birds.  The Broiler Directive was the first piece of EU legislation to introduce animal—based indicators as a way to monitor the welfare of animals. Current information and research shows that the use of these indicators, such as footpad dermatitis in poultry, has brought about the majority of improvements in farm welfare for chickens. Encouraged by this, we will continue to develop animal—based indicators as a way of continually improving conditions for animals. We believe that there is still a lot of room for improvement in animal welfare, but the work already carried out by the European Union gives us hope that a lot has also been achieved so far. In 2019, the Commission, together with the Member States and stakeholders, will work to identify further animal—based indicators for broilers. We hope that these new indicators can be used by national authorities and also by the Commission to better target their action and thus improve the implementation of the directive. Investment in the health and welfare of animals on farms, of course, brings additional benefits. As has just been mentioned, improvements in animal husbandry have reduced the need to use medication on farms, including antibiotics. This is very significant and provides a strong boost to our fight against antimicrobial resistance. Through the marketing standards for poultry meat regulation, we provide incentives and support for animal—welfare—friendly chicken production. We list certain specific terms, which can only be used for poultry meat produced in alternative production systems. These include terms such as ‘extensive indoor’, ‘traditional free range’ and ‘total freedom free range’, which are defined and limited to farms meeting specific criteria. Member States may additionally co—finance investment in animal—welfare—friendly production systems through the Rural Development Programmes. This funding can be used, for example, to upgrade, fit and improve housing where it goes beyond the minimum required standards. As regards the question of mandatory labelling of poultry meat, the Commission carried out a feasibility study on animal welfare labelling, following extensive stakeholder consultation, and the outcome of this study was included in a report from the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council, adopted at the end of 2009. This study concluded that mandatory animal welfare labelling in respect of minimum EU standards would offer no added value. Our work to improve animal welfare standards and implementation in the EU continues. In 2019, work will commence on the designation of the EU Reference Centre for Animal Welfare for poultry, rabbits and fur animals. This centre is expected to provide scientific and technical information, through which we will be able to support Member States in the implementation of animal welfare rules. I look forward to the discussion and your views on this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 138, "date": "2018-10-04.json", "name": "José Inácio FARIA", "mepid": "125101", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, on 13 September we also adopted the report by Mrs Kadenbach on the European Commission's proposal for the European Single Health Action Plan against resistance to microbial agents. At the time I had the opportunity to say what I now repeat: it has become indeferred to halt the unruly use of antibiotics introduced by the intensification of animal husbandbreeding practices. Commissioner, even if we can accept that antibiotics are important in ensuring food security, we cannot, however, let the evolution of breeding technologies that aim to reduce costs and achieve maximum income in livestock production take place at the expense of the future of our health.  The truth is that high-density farming uses antibiotics improperly and systematically on the farm of poultry, often in unhealthy environments, to prevent the spread of diseases resulting from the conditions of steniguity, confinement and stress in which animals are kept. These conditions still have the aggravation of inhibiting the natural immune system of animals, but the use of antibiotics such as prophylaxis and metaphylaxis in food-producing animals will see its ambitious end this year with the final approval of the report on the regulation on the use of veterinary medicinal products.  In this regulation it will also be very clear that the disease should be avoided not by routine antimicrobial use, but by good practices or techniques of compartmentalization hygiene and good animal management.  I believe that protecting consumers and public health involves using healthy, good quality breeding animals with adequate genetic diversity and growing naturally is to ensure breeding conditions that respect the behavioural needs of species such as social interactions and hierarchies and also to maintain an animal density that does not increase the risk of disease transmissions. Commissioner, I now ask the question that is implicit in my colleagues' oral question: can Member States count on the implementation of the measures necessary to have quality food products on the market, without unnecessary antibiotics that prevent the emergence of antimicrobial resistance and, I will like, Madam President, with the last question: can European citizens consume poultry meat without concern?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 2, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 139, "date": "2018-10-04.json", "name": "Maria NOICHL", "mepid": "124836", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

When you see the advertising about chicken meat, it is advertising that stands for a new way of life. It's all about light cuisine, it's about modern cuisine, low-calorie cuisine. It is also about the feeling that you have to buy an honest product here. But nowhere are reality and advertising as diverging as in the chicken sector. If people knew how this supposedly lightweight product is produced, they would refrain from doing so. In other words, the advertising that sells us chicken meat as light and modern in Europe has nothing to do with reality. I would like to ask you, Commissioner, whether you are doing everything in your power to bring these two things together? Because thoughts that people have in mind when you think of chicken meat, and reality? Because chicken meat is not healthy, as it is produced – neither for the chickens nor for the people. The issue of antibiotics has been raised several times. Healthy, although it is often read in the magazines, chicken meat cannot be so in this mode of production. Can it be easy? It may be easy to buy chicken meat, but the life of the animals is not easy. The life of the animals is often without sufficient space, without water, without ventilation in an ammonia tank, in an ammonia cloud, for which people usually have to put on a gas mask, because they do not really endure this ammonia cloud. So it's not easy! And the next thing: Is it honest? We stand for honest transparency in Europe, which should definitely support customers in their purchasing behaviour. And it's not honest! We urgently need better labelling to make it clear which product the buyer buys when he goes to a shop. For this we need labelling, for this we need more honesty in transport, more honesty in slaughter, more honesty in the selection of breeds – two-way breeds would have existed for a long time or slower growing breeds that honestly had something to do with the product. Commissioner, you have a great deal of responsibility. And in the word responsibility is the word answer. Ask your Commission to answer these questions!

First, poultry rearing in small flocks similar to natural ones was reduced, then mulching on litter was eliminated, replacing it with rearing in single-level cages up to eight storeys in order to achieve high production without taking into account the natural needs of birds. At the moment, European law allows a density limit of 33 kg/m2, sometimes even more, which means that one chicken has an area less than a sheet of A4. Therefore, it is not only necessary to ensure lower stocking density, access to natural light, better air quality or reduced ammonia emissions. All this should reduce the need for antimicrobials.  The most important, however, would be measures to reduce the negative impact of poultry meat consumption on public health, reducing the bioaccumulation of substances such as herbicides, pesticides and, of course, antibiotics. It is also about minimizing fetor and noise from farms. Is it genetically modified or does it contain pesticides? A huge threat – already spoken here – is, of course, the bioaccumulation of antibiotics in chicken organisms and the possible getting into water and wastewater. There is also a lack of noise and fetor regulations, which exposes local residents to inhalation of odours with exposure to respiratory diseases.

Here are three arguments to show why urgent action is needed. First, it is a breeding that is completely contrary to the welfare of the chickens. Spaces are overcrowded and chickens cannot move enough, tingle, hop on branches and not even properly spread their wings. This treatment causes enormous suffering. Their bones become fragile and their behavior abnormal.  Second, it has consequences for the health of animals and human beings. Most chickens in the European Union are kept in intensive breeding systems that contribute to poor health conditions and require mass treatment with antibiotics to prevent or contain epidemics. This develops the emergence of antimicrobial resistance, which is a threat to public health. Third, it has serious consequences for the environment. Intensive farming is also a source of pollution. To name but one: ammonia. Ammonia pollutes air, water and soil and, instead of subsidizing more environmentally, animal and human practices, we fund these large-scale exploitation practices by subsidizing them with the CAP.  The way we treat animals is a mirror of our European society and I am sure that we do not want a society where industrial farming and animal abuse continue to be subsidised.

Such a chicken grows in less than 6 weeks from a small chick to a kilo stunner of more than 2 kilos. They sink through their paws and they literally grow dead. In the Netherlands we call this chicken a flop chicken. 50 years ago, it took chicks almost half a year to reach the weight of an adult animal and now only 42 days. Their short life is a long agony. They are crippled, they suffer from foot ulcers, they have massive joint pain and heart failure. In order for as many chicks as possible to survive, an enormous amount of antibiotics are used, and only because in the European Union production and consumption must grow compulsively, at the expense of public health, at the expense of the environment and certainly at the expense of animals. We must put an end to this by banning fast-growing chicken breeds as soon as possible. In addition, chickens need space, fresh air, daylight and a free range so that they can go outside daily but certainly also in case of a barn fire. For the past 11 years, the European Commission has been idling. Her report showing that there are major welfare problems in the chickens came 6 years too late and did not give any solution.

The problem today is serious and it is right to talk about it because there are more and more investigations and testimonies that give us the measure of how intensive broiler farming is a completely unsustainable business. Animals are fortuitously fed and grow structurally weak, for the sole purpose of producing low-quality meat sold at low prices. Animals kept in large numbers in extremely small spaces in terrifying conditions, where animal and zoonose diseases spread with extreme ease. Unfortunately, the recipes used by industrial livestock farming in these situations are completely wrong. Acting on chickens to prevent outbreaks of disease through the preventive and systematic use of antibiotics cannot be an adequate response, it cannot be because it only aggravates the phenomenon of antibiotic resistance, both in animals and in humans. This is now the most pressing public health emergency in Europe.  In this connection, I would like to point out, as has been said, that Parliament expressed itself in a report by Mrs Kadenbach in September. That is why I believe that the sector must be reminded of its responsibilities and that the processing of livestock farming is more necessary than ever in the European Union and in Italy in particular. My country is the second largest for the use of antibiotics on farms, with over 1 300 tonnes per year, an impressive figure, but it could be drastically reduced if we finally decided to make another model of meat production and consumption prevail, a model based on good farming practices and the application of strict biosecurity measures. But not only that, in order to reduce the use of medicines and the considerable environmental impact of industrial broiler farming – and we have mentioned ammonia emissions are a huge problem – the decision to abandon the use of cages can play an important role.

This macabre daily newspaper is not the exception since the percentage of farms with more than 5,000 head owns 93.5% of chickens in the European Union. These animals, themselves selected for their extraordinary growth, four times faster than that experienced in the 1950s, attest to the extreme industrialization of our agricultural production. Far from being the preserve of a horde of vegan bobos confided in its material comfort, as it is said in the media, the question of animal welfare conceals in it the fate of a world population in explosion. Indeed, at a time when antibiotic resistance threatens to precipitate us into an unprecedented health crisis, which would cause up to 10 million deaths per year by 2050, the impact on humans of their intensive use to compensate for the infections that abound in these overcrowded farms is now proven.  Finally, the ethical question remains, since if the treatment of the most vulnerable testifies to the degree of civilization of a human society, we can no longer ignore the abject suffering inflicted on so many sentient beings in the name of unbridled productivity.

The 2007 Directive lays down minimum standards for the protection of chickens kept for meat production. As always, it is key that enforcement of these directives is consistent across Member States and, up until this point, we have not seen that happen. Some of the problems we were speaking about today allegedly include the fact that chickens which are bred purely for the purpose of meat are often reared in groups of tens of thousands in terrible conditions, without any possibility of expressing natural behaviours, such as perching, pecking or even experiencing natural sunlight. There are also several knock—on effects to humans from rearing chickens in this way, such as a threat to our health from antibiotics used on chickens. This is simply an issue we can no longer ignore. Furthermore, it seems the pollution caused by industrial poultry production is ever—increasing and is now seen as a major contributor to ammonia pollution of air, soil and water. I believe the industry is currently taking steps to address some of these issues, but again it is imperative that a comprehensive approach is taken to ensure we tackle these problems in the most efficient way and spread awareness across all Member States of the extent and variety of the problem. I support Karin Kadenbach and others’ questions to the Commission and wonder what is going to be done to improve the welfare of broiler chickens. Are any steps being taken to address some of the issues? Are broiler chickens going to be afforded a better existence? Are there alternative methods of rearing chickens being looked into that can attempt to improve their quality of life, while also minimising the negative impact it has on humans and on the environment?

I myself was in the Netherlands with the Committee on Agriculture two years ago. Stables have been developed there together with the University of Wageningen, where animal welfare is very much taken into consideration. However, the Commission is not in a position – and I agree with the previous speakers – to implement Directive 43/2007, that is to say, to finally ensure that the rules that actually exist are implemented. Then those who do it right are ultimately the painted ones, because when they invest in animal welfare, they are ultimately no longer competitive, because others simply produce cheaper. We have also seen this in the production of eggs. It was and still is there. Those who invested in better stables were ultimately no longer competitive on the market because others in Europe continued to work with old stables. The same thing happens with the eggs. The stables in Europe have been dismantled and transferred to Ukraine, and the eggs have then been imported, duty-free. Here, too, we have to be careful. Either those who import have the same rules, or else they have to impose protective duties on these products. Anything else is unacceptable to our farmers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 150, "date": "2018-10-04.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "  I was a little more generous with speaking time today because I do not have any speeches on the catch-the-eye procedure.

This is an important topic. Thank you very much for this short discussion on the issue. I will of course pass all of your remarks, concerns and the whole message to Commissioner Andriukaitis, but let me just point to two things.  First, the Commission wants to move things forward and to really work on this subject. We will continue to work on the enforcement of the directive, but at the same time – and that is why your remarks were so valuable – we need to work closer together to reduce the impact of industrial farming as far as possible, both for the welfare of the chickens and for the environment and human health. We will take all of your concerns into consideration. Let me also tell you, a little bit more personally, that I will do my best in my capacity to get a lot of interest in the Commission on this.
