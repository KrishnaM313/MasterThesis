Madam President, in July we voted in the Committee on Legal Affairs and by a large majority the report on the application of European law for the years 2012-2013. The report also served as a tool for our Commission's dialogue with the Committees on Petitions, Constitutional Affairs, the Environment and Individual Rights. Through this creative process of exchanging views with Members from different political areas and with different parliamentary powers, we have been led to the text before you today.  This report is added to a series of previous corresponding reports which each year reflect Parliament's response to the Commission's official opinion on how European law was applied or not applied, at a given time period, in the Union. Traditionally, these reports have emphasised the way in which Member States apply European law and the mechanisms and tools that can be used to comply with their obligations.  This dimension of the application of Union law, we develop it in detail in our report with evidence, so that it can be understood by every citizen who identifies the difficulties and problems. But for the first time, we dared to go one step further. For the first time in this report, we dared to say the obvious, namely that the application of EU law is not only a requirement for the Member States but also binds the Union itself, its institutions and bodies. It should be noted in particular that, in the context of the recent financial crisis, Member States were obliged to take measures that undermine the primary law of the European Union and in particular its provisions relating to the protection of social and economic rights. The report urges the Institutions of the Union, the Council, the Commission, the European Central Bank, to respect primary Union law, the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights when adopting provisions of secondary law and when adopting policies on economic and social issues affecting human rights. The report also expresses concern that the austerity measures imposed on heavily indebted Member States of the Union, which were subsequently incorporated into acts of secondary European Union law, before being transposed into domestic law, during the period covered by the two reports under consideration, and in particular the drastic cuts in public expenditure, have resulted in a significantly reduced capacity of Member States to comply with their obligations to properly apply its law. European Union.  The report considers that Member States under economic adjustment programmes should continue to be able to fulfil their obligations to respect social and economic rights and recalls that all the institutions of the European Union, even when acting as members of groups of international lenders (see Troika or Quaretta), are bound by the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the Union.  Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I ask you to vote in favour of the report, because I believe that this is a comprehensive and balanced report, which builds on what has already been built but also dares to introduce new dimensions of the problem, in a way that ultimately strengthens and honours the competences of our Parliament as the voice of the peoples of Europe.

The Commission highly appreciates Parliament’s increased interest in implementation issues. I believe our debate today could not have come at a more crucial point for the EU. The European Union is a union based on law. We have built this body of law together. It is the basis for our actions. It is not enough to merely pass legislation: what matters is its application on the ground. If it is not applied, the EU foundation weakens. The importance of the correct application of EU law cannot have been made clearer than by the current migration crisis. With the current unprecedented flows of people coming to Europe in search of refuge, the correct application of our legislation on asylum is vitally important. EU law provides that all those entitled to asylum and protection are received in humane conditions and have their case dealt with efficiently and quickly. We certainly do not apply EU law in all Member States at this stage. EU law also requires that all those who have no right to stay must be returned to their countries of origin rapidly and efficiently. This is why, in addition to the measures that we have adopted this week, we will make the correct application of EU asylum law the priority of our actions. We have already started with infringement procedures. The Treaties entrust the Commission, together with the Court of Justice, with ensuring the correct application of EU law. We take this role as guardian of the Treaties very seriously indeed. If Member States are not respecting the rule of law or are breaching EU law, we will not hesitate to launch formal infringement proceedings and take the case to the European Court of Justice where necessary. The Treaties also give us the possibility to impose financial penalties where judgements of the court are not respected and where directives are not transposed on time, and we use those possibilities systematically. This unique and essential role of the Commission is an integral and indispensable part of our legal system. In the report Members have expressed concern about the handling of complaints before they reach the stage of infringement proceedings and have called for this to be regulated in a European administrative law under Article 298 of the Treaty. I would like to stress that the Commission views complaints as an invaluable source for carrying out its task as guardian of the Treaties.  This is why the Commission has created a strong framework to protect complainants. The Code of Good Administrative Behaviour and the Communication on relations with the complainant offer a number of guarantees that safeguard complainants’ rights throughout the entire procedure. These include the right to be informed about any decision on his or her complaint, the right to be heard, prior notice before closing a case and a timeframe for a final decision on complaints.  Against this background, I am not convinced that there is a necessity to regulate this matter in a legislative act based on Article 298 of the Treaty. The Commission will continue to fully respect its commitments in the framework agreement to provide information concerning infringement procedures to the European Parliament. Moreover, it will also continue its current practice to inform the public at the latest when a letter of formal notice is issued.  Some of you have expressed concerns about the Commission’s Better Regulation Agenda, in particular the REFIT Programme, including an alleged deregulatory effect. In this respect, I want to make clear, first of all, that REFIT is not about deregulation. Rather, it aims at making sure that legislation remains effective and fit for purpose. It has a focus on transparency and openness, collecting views and suggestions from a wide variety of stakeholders, thereby reinforcing the protection of public interest. The REFIT Platform offers a forum for dialogue between the Commission, businesses, SMEs, social partners, civil society organisations and Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2015-09-10.json", "name": "Jytte GUTELAND", "mepid": "124991", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Behind each environmental law lies a great effort by civil society, organisations, politicians and citizens. But what is really happening in the next stage? The statistics speak for themselves. We see that most of the new delayed transposition cases initiated by the Commission were environmental- as many as 168 cases. I find it distressing, it is dangerous for the environment and it is an insult to all the people who have put a lot of energy into improving environmental policy. These are the problems that we pinpoint in our report. Firstly, we criticise the fact that environmental legislation is far too often implemented too late. Secondly, we are calling for the Commission to be stricter on those Member States that do not behave. Thirdly, we clearly show that the large number must not lower the level of ambition.

They hinder the delivery of tangible benefits for our citizens and pose problems for those wishing to live, work or do business across borders.  It is time to put people at the heart of EU policy-making by identifying problematic areas, dismantling barriers to citizens and improving implementation in ways which result in concrete benefits in the daily lives of our citizens. The Commission should push for a better mechanism for reviewing how EU rules are applied in practice and how citizens and businesses are empowered to exercise their rights.  So I was very pleased to hear the Commissioner express the same opinions in his speech. Inconsistent transportation hinders not only citizens but also Member States. Countries such as Malta which have a low rate of transposition infringement cases are competitively disadvantaged by other Member States which often maintain lower regulatory standards rather than transposing EU legislation.

One of the reasons why the European Parliament looks at the process of implementing European law in the Member States every year is to determine whether there has been an improvement, whether it is already better, or whether we still have a lot of problems. Statistics say it's better, but statistics are just statistics. We are still seeing many areas where the implementation of EU law into national legal systems is, firstly, delayed and, secondly, inefficient and inefficient.  The problem is that, too often, Member States apply specific legislative overlays, preparing an additional network of different legislative restrictions on what has been prepared at Community level. This makes the law less readable for those who are supposed to use it: for citizens, for companies operating in the European Union, and that is what we need to counteract.  It seems that timeliness is not the most important element here, but the quality of transposition. It should be the most important objective that we are aiming for, which is why I fully support colleague Chrysogos, who says that particular attention should be paid to the functioning of small and medium-sized enterprises when we are talking about the legislative process.  I also support it in stating that there should be better cooperation between the European institutions at all stages of law-making, at the initial stage of legislation, at the very stage of legislation, but also later when we assess it.

It is not an à la carte menu. If you want the rule of law to function and be respected by everyone, it should apply equally to everyone in all cases. That is what the Commission’s role is: to make sure that EU law is applied according to what was agreed by the legislators, including when it is transposed into national legislation. One Member raised the issue of the application of environmental law: the issue here is, indeed, partly one of late application but, unfortunately, in a larger number of cases it is about the wrong application of EU directives. The Commission then has to start infringement procedures – and we do start infringement procedures because I strongly believe that, if we do not, you undermine the very principle Socrates referred to, namely the application of all laws to everyone, regardless of their position, or regardless of the Member State. I insist on this because I believe this Commission will need to intensify its operations in making sure that EU law is applied correctly in all Member States. Secondly, I would like to pick up on a point about REFIT. Better regulation makes an immediate contribution to the better enforcement of EU law. By carefully assessing the impact of new legislation – and Mr Kelly referred to this as well – and by consulting widely, we ensure that the legislation we produce will be clear, workable and proportionate to the aims we pursue. By producing legislation of the highest quality and by ensuring that our acquis remains fit for purpose, we will also ensure that problems of enforcement are reduced. To make that clearer: in the beginning, if you are sure that you are not just looking for a compromise in this House but you are also looking for something that can be applied in a transparent and efficient way, you will create fewer problems afterwards. All three institutions involved – Parliament, Council and Commission – have a shared responsibility. I hope that we will soon conclude a new interinstitutional agreement on better law making, which will help us together to produce legislation that will serve the European citizen in the best possible way. A lot of complaints about red tape are not about the amount of legislation but rather about the quality of legislation which leads to undue administrative burdens. In his oral presentation, the rapporteur went deeply into the issue of austerity programmes. I did not see much of that in the report, but I did see it very much in his presentation. So let me go into that briefly: I strongly believe that economic adjustment programmes do not reduce the capacity of Member State authorities to comply with EU law. On the contrary, if you do not observe fiscal discipline over a longer period of time, you will fatally undermine the capacity of the state to provide social programmes to ensure the possibility of a welfare state. It is the triangle of fiscal responsibility, structural reform and investment. You cannot pick and choose. You cannot just say that you will only invest and will disregard fiscal responsibility – which is sometimes what people on parts of the left are saying – and you cannot just say that it is all about fiscal responsibility and we do not need investment – which parts of the right are saying. You need a balance in this triangle, as was stressed again by President Juncker last night. The Greek and Cypriot memoranda of understanding were not part of EU law, because they led to intergovernmental financial support – in contrast, by the way, to the Irish and Portuguese ones, which received support from the Union budget. The Greek and Cypriot MoUs were formally agreed only between the lenders and the beneficiary Member State. The Court of Justice confirmed that, when adopting and implementing measures under such an intergovernmental adjustment programmes, the national authorities of the Member State concerned are not implementing EU law.

It seems to be concluded that, with the exception of Members on the mountain benches of parliament's extreme right wing, all wings of this Chamber agree that we need more Europe and agree that we need to take the clock of history forward, not back, to a Europe of nations and national confrontations. But to do this, as the President of the Commission admitted yesterday, the European Union must, firstly, become more European and, secondly, more united. More European means that it must show greater respect for fundamental rights and the value of man, which is, in accordance with Article 2 of the Founding Treaty, the foundation of the Union. Let me once again insist that the concept of fundamental rights also includes social rights, which we must treat as rules of law and not as wishful speeches or mere declarations of a political nature. The Union must, of course, become more united, which means that greater coherence and solidarity must be shown both between the Member States and within societies. The issue of migration, and in particular the issue of refugees that we are so concerned about these days, is an issue that requires precisely practical solidarity between the Member States, greater coherence and a unified attitude to dealing with it, because otherwise the Member States of first entry are burdened with a burden which they are unable to cope with on their own.

We cannot help but note the active role of citizens and the European institutions in ensuring that Member States comply with EU law. The complaints they make are key. However, the overall decrease in the number of formal infringement procedures over the last five years (from 2 900 to 1 300) shows that a solution has been found. We cannot help but note the positive role of the EU Pilot preliminary procedure. In this respect, more transparency is needed in order for the European Parliament and citizens to be properly informed.

As one of the rapporteurs for Parliament’s implementation report on the Anti-trafficking Directive to be drafted later this year, I am very happy, Commissioner, to hear from you.  The EU actually has a good record on action to protect victims of human trafficking. In 2011, the Anti-trafficking Directive was held up globally as the gold standard in protection of victims because it adopts a gender-specific approach. Although the very nature of this crime makes it difficult to get reliable data on the numbers of victims, the Eurostat report earlier this year estimated that between 2010 and 2012 there were over 30 000 victims registered in 28 Member States, 80% of which were women. These figures do not, of course, include the huge numbers of victims who are not identified by authorities as victims of human trafficking.  Although victims are varied, held and controlled for a variety of reasons, we cannot dismiss the significant gender dimension of this crime. The majority, which is 69% of identified victims, were trafficked for sexual exploitation and 95% of that number were women. These numbers show that however good the EU is at tackling this issue, we cannot rest on our laurels. So whilst this crime constitutes a huge abuse of fundamental rights, it continues and is hugely profitable for the traffickers. Our work to protect victims must be vigilant and ongoing. Why, then, do we tolerate the lack of engagement by national authorities? How come, Commissioner, they are not pursued for the figures that they have committed to feed to your officers? It is clear that some countries have achieved a great deal and are cracking down on trafficking, whilst others have still to implement the directive fully and are dragging their feet in recognising this crime. What more evidence do they need to take real action, to which their governments have already committed themselves, in order to rescue the victims and pursue the perpetrators? How much longer do these people, who are controlled and sold as so much baggage, have to wait to get justice?  The evidence shows that human trafficking is an issue that European people want to see tackled with coordinated European action. When asked which forms of violence against women the EU should prioritise, trafficking in human beings comes out very high. The transnational nature of these crimes means that we can only address both the root causes, the rescue and care of victims, and the punishment of perpetrators, if we work together at both source and destination countries.  The Commission must come forward quickly with its post-2016 strategy towards the eradication of human trafficking. We in Parliament look forward to receiving these proposals so that we can work closely with you to crack down on this vile trade. The Commission must also ensure that they are monitoring and implementing the Anti-trafficking Directive in every single Member State. We hope that Parliament’s upcoming work on this will help feed into this work. Trafficking is a crime committed upon the most vulnerable and those victims deserve better protection, but we cannot do that effectively unless we know the state of play in each and every Member State. However, it is important to remember as we debate migration and human smuggling this week that human trafficking is a different, truly vile trade that abuses victims’ human rights. Commissioner, we look forward to working with you in the coming months to tackle this crime.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 26, "date": "2015-09-10.json", "name": "Catherine BEARDER", "mepid": "96955", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me start by expressing my thanks to Mrs Bearder for having taken this initiative and submitted this question. First of all, I would like to thank all Members of this House for your constant and keen interest in addressing trafficking in human beings and keeping it high on the European Union’s political agenda. Let us be clear, trafficking in human beings is about the buying and selling of people and their services. Trafficking in human beings is expressly prohibited in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights and addressing trafficking means upholding fundamental rights.  At the same time, this is a serious form of organised crime as clearly stipulated in the European Union’s Treaties. This deplorable crime would not exist without the huge profits for traffickers and the demand that drives all forms of exploitation. If we want to prevent more victims falling prey to traffickers we must follow the money, both in the legal and the illegal sectors, and we must stop the flows. Trafficking in human beings is now an integral part of the European Agenda on Migration and also of the European Agenda on Security. Indeed, it is a phenomenon with clear links to many policy areas within and outside the European Union.  Eurostat data indicate that for 2010-2012 the 28 Member States registered 30 146 victims. Eighty per cent of the victims were female and 70% of traffickers were male. Sixteen per cent of registered victims were children: girls and boys. Data prove that the most widespread form of exploitation is sexual exploitation – up to 69%, of which women and girls form the vast majority of the victims: 95%. Over 1 000 child victims were trafficked for sexual exploitation. These data clearly demonstrate a strong gender dimension to trafficking in human beings.  Let me be clear, the European Union has recognised that trafficking in human beings is a structural form of violence against women. It seriously inhibits women’s ability to enjoy rights and freedom on an equal basis with men. Gender plays a role at every stage of the trafficking process by increasing vulnerability to trafficking, by fuelling exploitation and influencing the effectiveness of assistance and support.  I am proud to say that the Commission has delivered a great deal and my services continue to deliver very ambitiously on work in this direction. We have a comprehensive legal and policy framework guided by the European Union’s Anti-trafficking Directive and the EU Strategy towards the Eradication of Trafficking in Human Beings 2012-2016.  The Anti-trafficking Directive is human-rights based and victim-centred. It is gender specific and child-sensitive. The deadline for transposition of this Directive expired on 6 April 2013. The Commission, as guardian of the European Union Treaties, initiated procedures without delay and I am pleased to inform you that, to date, 25 Member States have officially informed the Commission that they have fully transposed the Directive at national level. Only two Member States have not notified the Commission yet.  My services are currently analysing the information provided by all Member States and we will not hesitate to take all necessary steps to ensure full transposition and application of the European Union’s law.  The Commission will be submitting the following reports to Parliament and to the Council. First, in early 2016, the first European Union report on the progress made in addressing trafficking in human beings, as per Article 20 of the Directive, will be presented. Member States and civil society, as represented in the European Union’s Civil Society Platform, have submitted information to the EU Anti-Trafficking Coordinator as per Article 20 and the report is being prepared with my services. This report will address the gender dimension and relevant considerations. Secondly, the Commission will submit a unified report under Article 23 of the Directive in 2016. This report will assess the measures taken by Member States to comply with the Anti-trafficking Directive. It will also assess the impact existing national laws criminalising those who use the services of victims of trafficking have on prevention of this crime, accompanied if necessary by appropriate proposals. This report will equally address the gender dimension of trafficking in human beings, including, particularly, the measures to reduce the demand that drives all forms of exploitation.  The European Union’s Anti-trafficking Directive sets forth the legal obligation to reduce the demand that fuels exploitation, including by considering criminalising those who knowingly use the services of victims. The Employers Sanctions Directive already criminalises those who knowingly employ victims of trafficking who are third-country nationals.  My services have commissioned a study on the gender dimensions of trafficking in human beings from a renowned academic institution to examine the gender dimensions of trafficking for the purpose of sexual exploitation and measures to reduce the demand that fuels this exploitation. The study also took into consideration the recommendation of this Parliament in its resolution of 26 February 2014 on sexual exploitation and prostitution and its impact on gender equality. The study will be finalised by the end of this year.  The European Union Anti-trafficking Strategy comes to an end in 2016. As stipulated in the European Agendas for security and for Migration, we will adopt a post-2016 strategy. We will ensure that we consult old stakeholders and ensure that Parliament is kept abreast of developments. The gender dimension must be present in our post-2016 approach. Ladies and gentlemen, it is imperative to continue delivering. We owe this to the victims and, of course, to our societies, to our children and to the future generations.

The figures mentioned by the Commissioner are stunning and the human stories are heart-breaking. Commissioner, the EPP Group really welcomes your determination to ensure full compliance with a clear gender perspective. We are all concerned. This is serious organised crime with a cross-border dimension and it should be treated as such by all Member States. The network requires a common European response, with increased police cooperation and increased judiciary cooperation with Europol, Eurojust and Frontex.  It is really time to break the circle of impunity. There should be no hiding place for these criminals in and around Europe. We are calling on you, Commissioner, to present as soon as possible the report on compliance, ensuring a clear gender perspective because, as you said, sexual exploitation is one of the biggest causes of trafficking, as are the protection of victims (girls, women and people with special needs), reducing demand and supply and holding the users responsible.  The majority of victims of trafficking in human beings continue to be women and girls, and now increasingly migrants. Therefore, your new strategy against trafficking should, as you said, have a clear gender perspective: criminalise, strengthening cooperation and tracking funds. The EPP Group continues to be committed to zero tolerance against trafficking of human beings and keeping gender rights on the agenda.

As we have all said, trafficking is primarily a gender issue for women. It is so important that we work across Europe to deal with trafficking and that we acknowledge the emerging tactics of the traffickers themselves, who seem always to be one step ahead in this issue of modern slavery.  I also think it is important because I represent London, which is a major destination for traffickers, and as the EU goes into a period where we are preparing for a referendum on EU membership, I believe that the issue of human trafficking will be an important debate in that. It is women and girls who are being trafficked who are some of the most vulnerable people that we have to deal with. This is a European problem, and I believe that it has European solutions.

It is brothel owners and pimps, of course, but it is also men buying sex, and as in all other areas we have to address and target the market.  As the Honeyball report voted here last year concluded, the Nordic model criminalising both the pimps and the buying of sex services has been very effective in addressing the demand. So, what should the Commission be doing in targeting the demand for buying women and girls in the sex industry? So far, not enough has been done. I have read about the piece of research that has been awarded to a group of lobbyists and under-qualified researchers. I am very worried about this, and I think it is not serious.

It is the freedom of movement between countries that is enabling and encouraging this criminality, whether it is perpetrated against men, women, boys or girls. Having no possibility of any checks at any border obviously makes it easier than ever for people to be trafficked across our continent. The UK Government admits that EU free movement rules are helping organised criminal gangs to traffic and move not only illegal goods, but also people.  In a report from 2014 on the balance of competences, they say: ‘free movement within the EU is extensively exploited by organised criminals to bring illicit commodities including drugs, human trafficking victims, illegal immigrants and counterfeit goods to the UK.’ Europol admits that the free movement of people and goods across the EU’s internal borders reduces the chances of detection.  Eurostat asserts that 68% of people trafficked are women, and this is indeed a shocking percentage. However, surely the aim should be to end trafficking altogether – not worry about what gender-specific measures the Commission should take.  Free movement rules make trafficking easier for those who deal in human exploitation. We have to take steps to make this crime logistically impossible, we have to punish the criminals, and we have to punish them in such a way that it acts as an effective deterrent.

What this means in reality is that women are affected to a much greater extent than men by trafficking in human beings. In particular, with regard to trafficking in human beings for sexual purposes, which is also the most common form of trafficking in human beings, women and girls represent a clear majority. This fact means that women and girls are threatened with being sold in a market where their bodies are considered a commodity that men have the right to buy and exploit. We can no longer turn a blind eye to this kind of oppression and exploitation of people. Indeed, it is now time for the Commission to live up to its promise to evaluate the implementation of the directive adopted in 2011 by the Member States. It is time for the Commission to take a strong approach to this issue, and then a review of the measures taken by the Member States is the least I would ask for. Sex is not a human right.

Human souls, who without knowing it, consented to becoming another link in the chain of trafficking, following traffickers who promise them good jobs, souls who ended up victims of sexual or labour exploitation. What is the Commission doing to protect these victims, the majority of whom are women? It is once again behind developments, even delaying to assess the measures it has asked the Member States to take in order to tackle the problem of trafficking in human souls. Of course the Member States themselves have a responsibility, because they allow EU policy to be contradictory, and often hypocritical, on the issue of trafficking. Although the European Union wants to appear 'strict' with regard to victims of trafficking, it does, however, implicitly allow the phenomenon with its immigration policy, as it currently applies. By closing legal immigration routes, we are pushing thousands of women into the arms of illegal traffickers. I am sorry to see this, but the Union has contributed to the rise of the phenomenon of trafficking. But it has an opportunity to stem the phenomenon before it is too late, if it immediately evaluates and revises those measures that will enable it to achieve the objectives set out in the 2012-2016 Strategy. But that's not enough. Without coherence between immigration policy, trafficking policy and gender analysis, we will once again witness incidents of incredible horror ...

It is necessary to point out this modern form of abuse and slavery under the guise of the so-called right to a child. Surrogacy has become a big business, and that has to be said as a clear no. And the trade in organs of aborted children is totally unacceptable. The recently revealed scandalous practices of the International Organization of Planned Parenthood must be properly investigated. In the meantime, I am calling for the suspension of any financial support to this federation by us.

I see that some honourable Members use every opportunity to attack what constitutes a great – and maybe the greatest – achievement of the European Union: freedom of movement in a Europe without internal borders. I will repeat that Schengen is a part of the solution: it is not the problem, Schengen is not the problem. By making full use of Schengen rules we can be more efficient in checking and controlling our borders. Let me now focus on the issue before us. Colleagues, thank you very much for this debate. It was short but very substantial. We obviously share the same view. The gender question in human trafficking needs to be fully taken into account. Let me repeat it very clearly: trafficking is a crime against human rights as expressed in the European Union’s Charter of Fundamental Rights. There are still many victims of trafficking, and that is unacceptable. Ms Björk, as you well know, the criminalisation of users of services who knowingly use victims of trafficking is considered as a measure to reduce demand in the Anti-trafficking Directive. The Directive urges Member States to consider measures for criminalising the use of services with the knowledge that the person is a victim of trafficking. This means that the Directive does not oblige the Member States to criminalise such users of services: it simply obliges them to consider doing so, and some do. However, as I said, we are working on ways to reduce demand. The European Union has already taken strong action. We need to assess our achievements, as we are coming to the end of the Union’s anti-trafficking strategy.

Around 70 organisations are currently on this so-called ‘foreign agents register’ which carries many negative consequences. Some of those organisations have been forced to close down. The recent law on undesirable foreign and international organisations contributes further to the deterioration of an already difficult environment for civil society organisations.  It is yet another obstacle to the development of a free, strong and well- functioning civil society in Russia. In this repressive climate, members of civil society who do not agree with the authorities are identified as enemies of the State. This is a clear encroachment on fundamental rights.  To name just three recent cases: in June the Grozny offices of the Committee Against Torture were destroyed during a staged demonstration. The police stood by without offering protection; in July, members of the GOLOS electoral observation organisation were harassed by the authorities; in the run up to local and regional elections on 13 September 2015, frequent irregularities in the registration of opposition parties have occurred.  Furthermore, the rights of LGBTI persons are being violated and the Russian authorities have failed to prevent and prosecute homophobic violence which is tolerated under this so-called law on non-traditional sexual relations among minors. Today’s debate focuses on a number of individual cases all involving non-Russian citizens: the Estonian officer Kohver, who was abducted in September 2014 at gunpoint from the Estonian side of the border with Russia. His right to a fair trial was not respected, and he was sentenced to 15 years in prison in August 2015. The Ukrainian military pilot Nadya Savchenko, who was abducted from eastern Ukraine, sent to Russia and charged with trespassing and complicity in the murder of two Russian generals. Her trial resumes next week.  The Ukrainian activists Sentsov and Kolchenko: Sentsov, a film director, was arrested in May 2014 in Crimea and transferred to Moscow for alleged association with terrorist acts in Crimea. He was sentenced in August 2015 to 20 years in prison. At the same trial, Olexandr Kolchenko, a Ukraine activist arrested in connection with Sentsov, was sentenced to ten years in prison. These are flagrant breaches of international law and elementary standards of justice. The European Union has called, and will continue to call, for their immediate release as well as for the unconditional release of all Ukrainian citizens held illegally in Russia. In this respect, I recall this House’s resolution of 30 April this year.  The Russian authorities should live up to their international and European obligations in the field of human rights. The Russian authorities must put an end to the climate of suspicion, hatred and intolerance of diversity of opinion prevalent in Russia today. We must stand behind those who protect human rights in Russia. We will speak out every time clear breaches of human rights occur. We will continue to raise our concerns in international fora: the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. We will continue to use our financial instruments to support civil society and we will attend the court trials of human rights’ defenders and opposition figures.  We will do all this because we are committed to supporting human rights and the development of civil society in Russia and lastly, but very importantly, we will continue to discuss those issues directly with the authorities at all levels.

In other words, so that the European Union can better and more effectively enforce human rights where they are violated, if an international authority has already concluded that there are indeed violations.  This also applies to mr. Kohver's previous case. Simply, if the decisions of the Strasbourg Tribunal are international, the European Commission and the European Union and the EU institutions could propose solutions for their enforcement. I think that we should also encourage the Member States to do so.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 86, "date": "2015-09-10.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian FRUNZULICĂ", "mepid": "124790", "text": "   – Mr President, I am deeply concerned about the broader deterioration in the environment for freedom of expression in Angola, including the increased use of criminal defamation lawsuits against journalists and routine police abuse.

The right to freedom of association, assembly and expression are guaranteed by Angola’s national and international laws and human rights obligations. However, we have seen from recent events in Cabinda and Luanda that, on several occasions, individuals have been prevented from peaceful assembly and peacefully demonstrating in Angola. In some cases, the authorities have refused to allow demonstrations to take place, used excessive and unnecessary force or arrested and detained demonstrators. During the first European Union-Angola ministerial meeting, in October 2014, we also highlighted that a free, pluralistic media was an essential component of a multi-party democracy. We have already made various démarches in dialogue with Angola to decriminalise defamation, since the defamation laws can be a threat to investigative journalism. It is in exactly this context that the European Union delegation in Luanda has been following closely the case against journalist Rafael Marques, as well as the case against the Cabinda human rights activist José Marcos Mavungo, by monitoring trials and being in contact with their lawyers. During the most recent Article 8 political dialogue with Angolan Minister of Foreign Affairs Chikoti, on 11 August 2015, a long and frank discussion took place. The European Union delegation, together with the Member States represented in Luanda, expressed concern at recent developments. These include the detention of 15 young activists, the recurrent denial of freedom of assembly, the case of the Cabinda human rights defender Mr Mavungo and the lack of transparency surrounding events in Monte Sumi, where an unknown number of members of the religious cult Kalupeteka were killed in a confrontation with the police in April. On a positive note, the government has accepted to implement the majority of the Universal Periodic Review recommendations and has made good progress on women’s rights, in particular with the enactment of the law on the participation of women in political life. We also welcome the recent accession by Angola to the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the protocol to prevent trafficking in persons. The European Union will continue to call on Angola’s government to fully respect the effective exercise of the rights of freedom of peaceful assembly and of freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial, in line with Angola’s constitution and international conventions and the regional human rights instruments that Angola is a party to.

Last summer I attended the start of the mock trial against Leyla and Arif Yunus. They were in a glass cage and couldn't consult with their lawyers. Both have serious health problems. Arif Yunus even had to be taken away by ambulance during the process. It was clear to everyone that it was an absurd indictment and not a fair trial. Imposing a prison sentence of eight and six-and-a-half years respectively on sick people in their 60s is equivalent to a death sentence. This is today's Azerbaijan! It is therefore incomprehensible to me that the diplomatic service of the European Union and the Commission have so far not been more firm about this state of affairs in Azerbaijan. After the sentencing of Leyla and Arif, the call for release finally came. However, this was not the case in the cases of Intigam Aliyev, Rasul Jafarov and Khadija Ismayilova.

Our relations have intensified over the last years under the Eastern Partnership, and we would like to see this relationship prosper and develop further on the basis of common interests and values.  However, there are important issues in our relationship that need to be addressed openly among partners. The European Union is following the human rights situation in Azerbaijan closely. Notably, we observed the trials of Leyla and Arif Yunus, of Khadija Ismayilova and, in the spring, of Rasul Jafarov and Intigam Aliyev, just to mention some of the human rights defenders and journalists in Azerbaijan. We have reacted to these negative developments in statements and direct talks at the highest level. We continue to call for the release of human rights activists and journalists imprisoned without a fair trial. We would like to see Azerbaijan live up to its international commitments as a member of the United Nations, the Council of Europe and the OSCE, notably when it comes to safeguarding freedom of expression and association and applying the rule of law, with an independent judiciary and with access to fair and transparent trials. We do not underestimate the challenges that Azerbaijan faces to further develop its independence and stability in a volatile region. We remain convinced that the only way for a country to ensure its long-term stability and security is to allow space for citizens to contribute freely to the political debate. For this, journalists must be allowed to perform their work freely. We expect more action to be taken in this regard. I understand that the Azerbaijan authorities are actively investigating the recent murder of the journalist Rasim Aliyev. Our delegation works hard to promote human rights and has good contacts with civil society in Baku. Our financial assistance is key in this endeavour since it targets the most vulnerable sectors and makes a difference in people’s lives.  Our delegation also offers concrete support to human rights defenders at risk. We will continue to stand up for our shared values and interests in our bilateral relations as well as through the Eastern Partnership and as fellow members of the Council of Europe.  To achieve sustainable results, we will have to apply a long-term constructive approach based on dialogue and engagement and the intense use of diplomatic channels. In order to put our relations on a new base and to develop their full potential, exploratory talks with Baku on an agreement will start next week.  This will bring new opportunities to engage with Azerbaijan across all fields of common interest and values, in line with our international commitments. In this endeavour of engaging Azerbaijan critically but constructively, we need to work together with you. While we understand that some Honourable Members are not comfortable with the idea of negotiating with Azerbaijan in the current circumstances, we must use this new opportunity to pursue human rights objectives as an integral part of our wider relationship.

The mechanisms that define the eurozone, including the absence of centrally funded Treasury mechanisms and of mutualised instruments for tapping financial markets, plus the wide range of endowments characterising the separate territories of the zone, are leading to transfers of resources from ‘south’ to ‘north’.

It should be ensured that they contribute on a micro basis as well as within a macro-regional framework, to counter, or compensate for, this transfer of resources.

The Commission's sixth cohesion report shows that cohesion policy eased the impact of a sharp decline in public investment in the period 2007-2013, in some Member States by 60% and in the EU by an average of 20%, as it ensured the flow of funding at a time when national investment had fallen or dried up.

New policies are therefore needed in order to truly achieve economic, social and territorial cohesion in the EU. The real economy must be boosted, growth promoted and new quality jobs created.

One of the central ideas of the report is that the effectiveness and credibility of cohesion policy can only be maintained if we eliminate the very significant payment arrears and preserve the scale of the EU's budgetary resources for cohesion policy.  The report will focus on unemployment, in particular youth unemployment and the ability of small and medium-sized enterprises to create jobs. In order to promote job creation, Tamás Deutsch calls for a coordinated use of the European Social Fund and the European Regional Development Fund, while also proposing to reduce the administrative burden on the at-risk in order to increase efficiency.  The report reaffirms the original objective of cohesion policy, reducing development gaps, while emphasising its contribution to achieving the Europe2020 Strategy's smart, inclusive and sustainable growth goals and its role in mitigating the devastating effects of the crisis.

In accordance with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the Commission has an obligation to present every three years a progress report on the progress made in reaching the economic, social and territorial cohesion of the Union. Accordingly, on 23 July 2014, the European Commission adopted a report assessing the previous generation of cohesion policy implementation (2007-2013) and notes that it has mitigated the impact of severe cuts in public investment following the emergence of the financial and economic crisis. Nevertheless, regional inequalities due to the crisis have deepened further. The rapporteur primarily analyses the successes and challenges of cohesion policy in the context of the economic and financial crisis, and points out that the crisis has further highlighted the role of the Commission's cohesion policy in overcoming the crisis and combating the decline in public investment and a significant increase in unemployment.  I agree with the notion that multi-level governance, supported by partner principles, as well as the sectoral and territorial approach are the main strength and lever of this policy.

According to the European Commission's estimates, the average age of Europeans will be higher than 50 in 2050. European countries must be prepared to make a difference, both in the economic, social, medical and educational areas. In principle, the scenes of fiction have become a reality when we answer the question of how to prolong a person's working capacity, how to enable them to adapt to the demands of the labour market.

One of the main objectives of this European Year is to raise awareness of the importance of active ageing and its dimensions. Active ageing enables us to exploit the great potential that older people represent in society, enriched by exceptional experience and wisdom. I believe that the demographic change facing Europe should be seen as an opportunity to improve the quality of life in the ageing process and make society more friendly, rather than a burden on European society. Recognising the contribution of older people and strengthening the positive role they play in society and working to improve intergenerational dialogue is key to achieving this objective.

I therefore agree that it is essential to promote age-adapted environments, taking into account impending demographic developments as well as the development of the 'senior economy' on the basis of economic opportunities resulting from public and consumer expenditure related to an ageing population and with certain innovative products, services and solutions and needs of the population over 50 years of age , which generates new jobs and growth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 352, "date": "2015-09-10.json", "name": "Christofer FJELLNER", "mepid": "28126", "text": "  Written. \\u2012 We Moderates have voted in favour of the evaluation of the European Year of Active Ageing.

The increase in life expectancy is one of humanity's greatest achievements, but it is followed by greater social requirements and the need for additional public services. An ageing European society is, on the one hand, a challenge for public budgets and, on the other hand, a great capital of experience and a wealth of potential mentors for the entering generation.  However, I would like to draw attention to a very important part of this report, namely the coping of older people in a digital society. More and more services are available on the Internet. More and more jobs are being created to digitise societies. However, according to the Scoreboard of the Digital Agenda for Europe, only 20% of people over the age of 55 have sufficient skills to cope in the digital environment and 41% of over-55s have never used the internet. This is due to difficult access to training and a lack of assistance in professional retraining. These two factors should be at the heart of further action if we want older people to be actively involved in the labour market and not be digitally excluded.

Concrete measures should also be put in place to ensure the application of the 'user pays' and 'polluter pays' principles. A common vision of change cannot be achieved unless there is cooperation and coordination between all the actors working at level, not only at European level, but at national, regional and local level.

The financial perspective 2007-2013 brought about significant changes in the infrastructure of the new Member States. However, we are still quite far from the vision of a single European transport space and coherent infrastructure. The TEN-T has still not been developed satisfactorily, which would include interoperability, the development of intelligent transport systems, road, track and air safety. Increasing the efficiency of transport, charging for the use of infrastructure, the role of public, collective passenger transport are another important area in which we make modifications.

There is no doubt that such a document must be updated frequently and the objectives formulated modified and revised according to the progress of the work, so that the strategy does not work solely on paper. In the White Paper four years ago, many objectives were formulated too abstractly, as is clear at the stage of the current review. The assumptions made in 2011 for the move away from fossil fuels have not only not been met, but their consumption has also increased slightly. There is no need for better proof that climate policy cannot be built in isolation from economic realities and consumer preferences. In other areas too, the White Paper deserves to be revised. Modern and electrified public transport, the needs of pedestrians and cyclists in building transport infrastructure, the particular importance of the TEN-T network in the context of the creation of the EFSI, the protection of the free market and entrepreneurs in the road transport sector, unfair competition from Asian airlines or the sharing economy – these issues need to be better highlighted in the White Paper and are included in the TRAN report.

This is not the only case of gender discrimination in Irish universities in recent years. In fact, in 2009 only 10% of senior academic posts were held by women and, after Malta, Ireland has the second highest glass-ceiling index for women in higher education.

Under the guise of respect and promotion of equality, this report aims to apply quotas in university governing bodies, but also in research teams. However, at no time is there any mention in this report of the number of female scientists who would have encountered difficulties in their careers because of their gender. On the contrary, since Marie Curie, a two-time Nobel laureate, women have increasingly embraced scientific careers. Far from valuing women, this quota policy is imposed by normative means and reduces the possibilities of choice, selection and meritocracy.  Ultimately, this practice is demeaning, with some women suspected of holding their jobs only because of their gender.

The term \"glass ceiling\" was introduced in 1986 by journalists from the Wall Street Journal. It identifies invisible barriers to prejudice that prevent women from progressing in their careers. Although considerable progress has been made in this area, I believe that further positive developments are needed. However, this should not be limited to the issue of gender. I believe that inequalities linked to a different socio-economic environment need to be perceived and corrected.

I believe that women also represent a highly educational and intellectual potential for the area under debate, the use of which is proving to be very insufficient.

Research shows, for example, that both sexes are particularly disadvantaged by the fact that both sexes consider male candids to be more promising for a job requiring mathematical knowledge.

A similar situation is also in situations where women make up the majority, for example in the education sector. Despite the positive changes in recent years, gender equality has still not been achieved in the scientific and academic sphere (the situation varies by Member State, research areas and academic title).

A special case is that of women involved in science and academia: their share is at an alarmingly low level, of only 18% of university professors and 10% of rectors. In order to correct this glaring imbalance, it is necessary for the European institutions to apply gender policies more vigorously, in order to aim as much as possible to equalise the status of women with that of men, both through educational policies, promotion programmes and non-discriminatory practices, and by establishing mandatory quotas in the scientific and academic institutions of the Member States, by ensuring a balance between personal and career life.

The Union must support an extensive programme of education on gender equality in schools, including media literacy, the fight against bullying, including online bullying ( cyber-bullying), homophobic violence, hate speech and civic education.

The Rodriguez report, which is being voted on today in the European Parliament, seeks to require Member States to implement gender equality measures at all levels of education. This would mean fully integrating appropriate measures into teacher training, introducing monitoring mechanisms on this, working directly with families and even making gender issues a topic in sport and leisure activities. As much as we affirm women's equality, these plans go far beyond the mark. It is also becoming increasingly clear that in many cases boys and young men are the disadvantaged sex today. It is high time to give you fair opportunities in training again. Moreover, the provisions of the Rodriguez report blatantly exceed the powers of the EU. Education policy falls within the competence of the individual EU Member States! In Germany, education policy is even a matter for the Länder. In view of this, it seems absurd for the EU to want to adopt comprehensive rules in the field of education.

I was particularly concerned with this aspect as this is a matter for the people of Switzerland to decide and not the EU. Moreover, it must be noted that Switzerland’s participation in the EEA Agreement was questioned by its people in a vote in 1992 and therefore the EEA Agreement after that is based mainly on sectorial agreements. However, there were some positive aspects to the report.

The rapporteur, Mr Schwab (CDU), has followed this line and has initially chosen very harsh wording. In doing so, however, the democratically expressed will of the Swiss is being disregarded. This is contrary to the EU's fundamental values. States must be able to renegotiate existing agreements which, in their view, are no longer up-to-date. It is true that we have managed to get the verbal sharpness out of the report, as well as Mr Schwab's specific call for the electricity agreement, which is particularly important for southern German industry, to be blocked. Unfortunately, however, there is still a general demand for sanctions and blockade positions and little willingness to seek dialogue.

Effectively implemented, this programme will reduce the number of economic immigrants who are a large part of the migration flow to Europe. It is extremely important to strengthen border controls to stop illegal immigrants trying to enter Bulgaria. Only through secure external borders can we guarantee national security and preserve one of the EU's greatest achievements – Schengen. With its extensive experience in successfully protecting the Bulgarian-Turkish border, Bulgaria can only contribute to the Schengen area. A more effective policy of returning illegal economic migrants entering Europe is also needed. The adoption of a pan-European list of safe countries of origin will speed up the examination of their documents and facilitate their return.

If we want a European solution, we must consult and involve the other Member States, and urgently avoid going it alone.

In view of the EU's major economic problems and the major integration problems of the refugees from Afghanistan, Eritrea, Iraq and Syria specifically referred to in the paper, the bad economic reality of large parts of the EU must not be denied, but a long-term perspective must also be developed.

Social entrepreneurship includes forms of entrepreneurship whose main purpose is social or environmental and where the majority of profits are reinvested for the benefit of this mission. While this objective is obviously laudable, I note the total contradiction with the competition policies advocated by the EU. Moreover, the social and solidarity economy is a sector that allows to maintain local jobs that are not relocated for people with low qualifications and which sometimes gives birth to great successes such as some SCOPs (example in the context of taking over profitable enterprises by its ex-employees ...) but this remains a largely illusory sector, since the salaries of these jobs are often capped, the scope of these jobs is often narrow and can only help a limited number of people, the state aid granted is poorly monitored and we have no concrete analyses on the long-term economic and environmental effects ...

In order to re-introduce citizens who have been out of work for several years into the world of work, specific employability improvement programmes should be developed and applied. A financial and economic structure should be established that favours continued participation in education and training, including the increasing number of people with disabilities through ageing, who need unhindered access, including reasonable adaptation, in such a way as to ensure that future workers will be highly skilled.  In order to forecast future skills needs, labour market players, including employers' and workers' organisations, as well as industry players at the forefront of IT and robotics developments, should be closely involved at all levels.

To tackle this problem, strong partnerships between governments and representatives of employers and workers are needed to find the best solutions to address skills inadequacy to labour market needs in all its dimensions.

Further concerns are caused by youth unemployment rates at EU level 20.9% and in particular in the Republic of Croatia by 43.1%.  This level of unemployment is partly due to an education system that does not teach young people the competences needed on the market, creating unfilled jobs due to a lack of the necessary skills for workers.  Education, training and the labour market at all levels need to be better linked. Another important item on the road to a competitive market is the mobility of citizens within the EU, which remains very low, despite high unemployment rates in individual Member States and unfulbed jobs in others.

In order to arouse an interest in these subjects, one has to start in kindergarten and especially introduce the girls and young women to technology and natural sciences. At the same time, we must bear in mind that we have over two million vacancies in the EU, which we can only fill if we improve labour mobility. In other words, Europe-wide transparency on vacancies, the promotion of foreign languages and the reduction of bureaucratic barriers to cross-border job search. With the revision of the EURES regulation, we have already taken an important step in this parliamentary term.

In my explanation, I am just mentioning one example. I believe that, perhaps not in all Member States, but in Hungary, for example, the data are highly distorted: the public works system, which provides around EUR 160 per month, is included, in addition to the fact that people who work abroad and people who work up to 1 hour a week are treated as one employee as well as full-time workers. It should also be mentioned that it would also be important to speed up the work of Eurostat at EU level, where data are processed 2-3 years late, so I do not think they reflect topicality. In addition to the statistical data, I am pleased that the report raises a number of important solutions for an efficient labour market.

In it, the European Parliament calls on \"the Commission and the Member States to establish a European minimum wage framework based on a base level in each Member State as part of the reduction of the pay gap, in order to ensure adequate incomes by legal means or through an agreement and in accordance with national practice\" (paragraph 106). I do not carry any minimum wage in any way, either at national or European level. I find it astonishing that so many of my colleagues are able to see a competitive labour market when the low-skilled are legally excluded from participation in the labour market by means of a minimum wage.

Although the result is not optimal, given that this would imply a clear denunciation of the emergence of illegal instances that ended up generating law such as the Troika, we do think that the report finds a space for politicization of the debate on an application of law that is not the same in some places and in others.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 1800, "date": "2015-09-10.json", "name": "Ernest URTASUN", "mepid": "124972", "text": "  in writing.
