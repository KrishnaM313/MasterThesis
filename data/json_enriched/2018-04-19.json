It is one of those EU initiatives that can save tens of thousands of lives and we need to save them today, in Europe.  One in three women has experienced physical or sexual violence since the age of 15. Every second woman has been a victim of sexual harassment. Women and girls living with disabilities in Europe are two to five times more likely to be victims of violence than non-disabled women.  Around 20% of European children are victims of sexual violence, most of which is committed by someone very close to them. One in five women has experienced stalking. One in four Roma people are victims of hate—motivated harassment and crimes. Thousands of LGBTI people are attacked or threatened with violence. There are tens of thousands of people who need protection. However, there have only been seven European Protection Orders (EPOs) issued in the whole of Europe so far.  For me, as a feminist, it is very frustrating to see that there is a tool that could be used but is not. For me, it clearly shows that, so far, neither the Commission nor the Member States have taken their responsibilities very seriously. Public servants who come into contact with victims do not know about this international protection instrument. Victim protection organisations do not know about this instrument. The victims themselves have hardly ever heard of the opportunity that they have to take their already existing national protection orders with them abroad when they want to travel or move to another EU country.  This Directive came into force in 2011. Member States had four years to implement it into their national laws by 11 January 2015. How many years do we have to wait until this Directive is properly implemented and provides protection for those who need it? This shameful situation has to change. Therefore, in our draft report we formulated several pages of demands, some of which are the following:  We call on the Commission and the Member States to make sure that information about EPOs really reaches the victims, the NGOs and the authorities that are working with these issues;  We call for mandatory training of professionals likely to come in contact with victims; We call on Member States to automatically inform persons who get a national protection order about the EPO and making the application process free of charge, shorter and easier for victims; We call for special measures to be implemented by the Member States for victims in vulnerable situations or victims with specific needs, such as children;  We call for free legal aid, translation and interpretation into a language understood by the victim; We call for a decision on the EPO request to be delivered within a maximum of two weeks; Given the increasing exposure of children and teenagers to violence online, we call on Member States to include education on gender equality and non—violence in the school curriculum;  Since the EU has focused its security agenda purely on its external aspect, we call on the Commission and the Council to place the issue of interpersonal security on the EU security agenda.  I would like to ask all colleagues to help us in our fight and to help to spread the word about this protection instrument so that everybody can exercise their right to live free from violence and the fear of it in our Europe. I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, Teresa Jiménez-Becerril Barrio, and all the shadows and all the colleagues who tabled amendments to this report, which make it strong. I hope for a successful voting outcome today, of course, and wish us all good luck. This is not acceptable.

As a victim of terrorism since the ETA terrorist organisation murdered my brother and his wife, since I entered this Parliament I have always taken care of defending the rights of the victims: of all victims — especially terrorism, but of all. I was therefore very pleased when this report was submitted in 2010 and was assigned to me; and I remember that we all had a lot of expectations about this report, because it would be a dynamic mechanism to avoid bureaucracy and improve the lives of victims. The EPO was the result of the Stockholm Programme, which required coherent political responses in the area of freedom, security and justice. We were not talking about creating a convergence of national laws, we were talking about a mechanism for judicial cooperation. However, this instrument, as it is currently found, has failed. It was estimated in 2010, when this Directive was introduced, that 100,000 women residing in the European Union had orders for protection of some kind for gender-based violence. Well, we know that only seven orders have been issued: four in Spain, two in the UK and one in Italy. That's a shocking scarce thing. Therefore, the question we have to ask ourselves — Parliament, Commission, all of us... also the Member States — is what has failed, and try with this implementation to give recommendations to the States and see what we have seen, because what we have to do is save lives and improve the lives of the victims. Since this directive came into force, we have no data from the European Commission, nor from the Member States. Even NGOs have not been able to collect data, because there are no data. With so few resources, it is good that we had the study of the European Parliament's Studies Service and, from there, we have shown quite a lot shortcomings. For example — I will quote a few of them — there is no central register of European orders, which makes it very difficult to assess them: the instrument itself is very complex — this is important — because it complicates the implementation of the Directive by national authorities and also complicates the understanding of the victims of this directive. There is no special provision for vulnerable persons, such as children, as persons with disabilities. There is a huge lack of training for national authorities: the implementation of the EPO in each country was not monitored; there is a huge gap between coordination and communication between Member States which have to implement the European order. Victims are not offered translation, which is necessary for a European protection order. As far as victims are concerned, an important aspect is that the protected person must be given adequate information on how to apply for such an order in another Member State. We have seen a general lack of information and awareness-raising campaigns: neither the police, nor the judges, nor the victims... no one knows this order. How are they going to ask for something that is unknown? Because, really, it's been ignored. I think it can be said that all the victims in this process will face some problem because they have to go from one country to another: if no one helps them, then they really prefer not to ask for it, and not even their lawyers... nobody advises them to do so. Therefore, we need to change coordination and communication between the authorities. We also call on the Commission to establish a European registration system to collect information on EPO from all Member States. We stress these legal and practical shortcomings. And, well, all I would say is that European citizens are really asking us for greater judicial cooperation. Victim Protection Orders and Victim Protection Orders are not working well euroorders for deliveries of aggressors. Europe is therefore not just the CAP, it is not just the euro, although they are very important; Europe is justice, freedom and security for all European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Teresa JIMÉNEZ-BECERRIL BARRIO", "mepid": "96806", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first, let me start by pointing out that all of the participating Member States have transposed the Directive on the European Protection Order. The Commission will issue the report on the application of the Directive on the EPO later this year. However, only today, the data already made available by the Member States also confirms that only a handful of European Protection Orders have been issued so far, as was rightly stated by the rapporteurs. We share your view that we have to improve awareness among practitioners about this instrument. This is why we are actively promoting the EPO. In particular, for now, we have collected practical information about national authorities competent to issue and recognise a European Protection Order. This is published on the websites of the European Judicial Networks in Criminal Matters and in Civil Matters. We have prepared an electronic version of the certificate on European Protection Orders in civil matters. This is quite a useful tool for judges. It is published on the e-Justice portal. We have also funded training materials on the EPO for judges. This information will soon be available on a dedicated training platform, also on the e-Justice portal. The Commission continues to fund activities under the Justice, Judicial Training, and Rights, Equality and Citizenship programmes which can include awareness-raising campaigns on European Protection Orders. We also continue to raise awareness with national experts from Member States; most recently, on 29 January this year, at the High Level Experts meeting on victims’ rights.  Finally, the Commission is carefully monitoring how Member States have transposed the provisions of the Victims’ Rights Directive requiring that victims must be informed about available protection, including in cross—border cases, from the first—contact authorities.

To date, this type of protection works weakly. A woman subjected to domestic violence can apply for a national protection order preventing an abusive husband from entering a communal apartment, for example. The moment a woman leaves her country for another country (for vacation or work), she is already insufficiently protected from the rapist. Why? According to 2010 statistics, there were already about 120,000 women subjected to violence eight years ago in the EU who received a national protection order. The vast majority of them do not know that they can be protected in other Member States. To date, just 7 (words seven) European protection orders have been put on display.

First, I would like to thank everyone involved for good cooperation on this very important issue. We need to speak plainly. Protective orders are effectively used to protect women who are victims of violence in close relationships, domestic violence, where harassment, stalking or sexual assault often occur. Violence against women is a brutal form of discrimination and a violation of human rights. In the EU, gender violence is a growing problem. Every third woman in the EU has been subjected to physical or sexual violence. It is not just harmful to the women who are subjected to violence, but to the whole society at large. It is therefore important that the European protection order works, that victims who have been protected identity, restraining orders or otherwise receive information that it exists and that they find out about their rights and opportunities. Equally important, it is that the designated authorities of the Member States gain knowledge of the implementation. I am very supportive of the lifting of victims of crime victims in human trafficking in particular, as it is a very vulnerable group that needs greater protection. The Istanbul Convention sets out specific measures to protect the rights of victims of crime. Fully implementing the Istanbul Convention will strengthen protections for those who are exposed. It is therefore very important that all EU Member States immediately support the Istanbul Convention.

I remember that in 2010, in the Victims Package, many of us in this House worked hard to achieve an important and useful tool that protects victims in Europe. At the same time, for us Europeans, it was a legal and logical expression of European integration. Along with the mobility of Europeans, we proposed, with this tool, protection of Europeans, especially when they are victims of violence.

We have a problem of harmonisation, too, of the types, because it is true that certain issues, such as harassment, which are covered by one legal system in another are not, and therefore that makes the instrument lose strength.

The EPO is just one of a raft of EU legal instruments intended to bring about an EU system of criminal law. This one concerns the mutual recognition of protection orders. The whole doctrine of mutual recognition is based on the fiction that every Member State’s legal system, police system and penal system is of equal standing, which is not true. The EPO doesn’t work, as only seven have ever been issued.

It involves applying a measure of expulsion, a ban on visiting certain places or a ban on approaching the victim within a certain distance for a criminal perpetrator throughout the Union. On paper, this could be a very good thing since this system should effectively protect a victim from further aggression. However, implementation becomes complicated, if not impossible because of the reality of a European Union of 28. Implementation is complicated, because we must necessarily change the laws of several Member States, without undermining the principle of subsidiarity and without doing so through sanctions that are and would be counterproductive for the women we need to protect. Implementation is impossible, since monitoring the whereabouts of an aggressor in a borderless area as large as Schengen would require considerable resources and perfect cooperation from the police and legal services of the Member States. How can we claim to be able to protect women, children, the weakest, when a terrorist is able to cross three states after committing a deadly attack? How do you want to protect a woman who is victims of violence when entire neighborhoods of our cities become non-legal areas for women? This system of protection that already exists in the Member States is a good thing, but the limits to which you yourself have forced it in a Europe without borders make it inoperative.

And I myself speak on behalf of many women who have benefited from a non-approaching measure of the person, whose validity, however, is limited to the country of residence alone.

When a State — Italian, France, Germany — makes a non-approach measure, this must apply all over Europe automatically; why should further requests be made? Secondly, women need to continue reporting.

In this House, we have recently discussed the future of our European project. The key to its development is intellectual, cultural, social and innovative enhancement — that is, in short, the construction of a Europe of knowledge. Education and higher education is a central role in the construction of knowledge Europe. The Bologna Process is a pillar already established in the Sorbonne Declaration of the European Area of Higher Education. Since the Bologna Declaration, or since 1999, a great deal has been done, both in the quality of education, in the aspect of mobility and in the aspect of recognition of diplomas and qualifications. Unfortunately, the level of implementation of the goals of the Bologna process varies widely between countries. The quality of this implementation is also important, because it affects both the reliability of the process and the actual execution of its assumptions. In very many countries, the Bologna process has been misinterpreted, in others there has been a mechanical division into first and second cycle studies, not caring about the programming content, in others it is considered that this is an imposed government initiative, not our common European project. Therefore, we refer the following questions to the Commission — firstly, does the Commission monitor the level of implementation of the Bologna objectives in each country? These most important objectives are the quality of education, reliable quality accreditation, recognition of qualifications and diplomas, the correctness of awarding famous ECTS credits, i.e. points recording student achievement, promotion of facilitating mobility of both students and staff, but also the promotion of continuing education at the academic level. We also ask how does the Commission assess the current state and level of the Bologna process? Our question is also whether the Commission has identified these factors that impede the effective and correct implementation of the process? Finally, how the Commission supports the Member States in proper implementation of the Bologna process? Signatories of the Bologna Declaration and ministers of signatory countries meet cyclically to summarize the achievements of the process on the one hand, and to set new objectives and new assumptions on the other hand. The last such conference was in 2015 in Yerevan. Then a message was issued with a very important message — strengthening the social dimension of the Bologna process, the inclusion of students with disabilities, the inclusion of people from disadvantaged backgrounds, the mobility programme that is the essence of this process. We have a question for the Commission, how does it assess the steps taken as a result of the Yerevan Communication? How much has been done in the social inclusion aspect of the Bologna process? In Yerevan was also accepted into the European Higher Education Area Belarus, but unfortunately the Belarus authorities have not fulfilled many commitments, nevertheless we expect Belarus to remain on the agenda of the European Higher Education Area and the possibility of lengthening road map for Belarus. There's another conference ahead in Paris. The European Commission is one of the signatories of the Bologna Declaration. So we ask what strategic objectives does the Commission have? What initiatives does he intend to take to strengthen the Bologna process? What about the area of higher education after 2020? What strategic objectives does the Commission set? We also ask — and we are very interested in — what is the link and relationship between the European Higher Education Area, the European Research Area and the European Educational Space heralded by the Commission? We are of the view, as the Committee on Culture and Education, that only complementary initiatives can build an attractive innovative Europe of knowledge.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Krystyna ŁYBACKA", "mepid": "124883", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you very much for this discussion, I’m very glad to be here to discuss the Bologna Process. This is the right moment, in light of the upcoming Bologna ministerial conference in in Paris on the 24th and 25th May. I hope to be able to address most of your questions in the limited time available; I will do my best. On the current state and the evolution of the Bologna process, much has been achieved in the last 20 years in its three 3 major commitments. First, the three-cycle Bachelor-Master-Doctorate system has been introduced. A common degree structure is one of the most significant achievement of the process. Second, there is a common standard for independent quality assurance in higher education, yet high education institutions should benefit even more from approaches offered by quality assurance agencies placed in other European countries, not only their own. And third, the European credit system is in use in most of the countries and has helped greatly for the contribution of diplomas and study periods abroad. These three commitments are key to build the trust which is necessary for learning mobility, cross-border academic cooperation and comparability of higher education systems. Based on these achievements, it is clear that the Bologna Process remains highly relevant, although we know that the implementation of some of the commitments is still uneven across its 48 member countries. And this is the main challenge for now. While the structures are to a large extent in place, though unevenly, we now need genuine implementation at the level of higher education institutions, which governance structures of the Bologna Process find difficult to reach. This is the main factor hindering affected implementation of the Bologna reforms. The Yerevan communiqué in 2015 therefore called on the Bologna countries to propose a method to improve the implementation of key Bologna reforms. The years since then have not been a period of radical change, but more of consolidation. We must use next month’s ministerial conference in Paris as an opportunity to stress the need for more even implementation of the Bologna commitments and to mobilise member countries and organisations to work together more closely In other words, the Commission wishes to provide support to those Bologna countries which lag behind in the implementation of the key commitments. In this context, the Commission supports the adoption of a new structured peer support process to ensure better implementation and monitoring of the reforms. Hopefully, the Bologna ministers will also commit to removing the remaining obstacles in their national legislation to cross-border quality assurance. Your question also addresses the issue of social inclusion, which is also extremely important in respect of refugees. Not enough Bologna countries have so far introduced measures to improve the conditions for under-represented and disadvantaged groups to access and to complete higher education. The first step to foster inclusion and improve equity is to collect information on the participation of under-represented groups in higher education. Only systemic monitoring can provide evidence on the effectiveness of those measures. For refugees, some countries have specific recognition procedures in place. Activities built on Erasmus+ funded projects for national academic recognition and information centres, which will improve the consistency of decision-making. The Commission has also organised several peer learning activities for Member States to share experience and good practice. The next question, on our assistance to countries in their progress towards the Bologna commitments: we offer support at EU level, for instance within the Erasmus+ programme where we have a targeted call for this purpose. We also assist the Bologna Process countries that are not part of the Erasmus+ programme. They benefit from capacity-building projects, which the Commission wishes to intensify in the next phase of the process. They are a key feature of the Bologna Process. And it is in the EU interest that a less developed system can evolve. You asked how the Commission monitors the recognition of the qualification. We have to admit that this is difficult to assess, as it is usually higher education institutions which take those recognition decisions. But aside from the Bologna Process implementation report, the Commission also carries out studies to identify obstacles, areas for improvement and best practices in recognition of qualifications and study periods. For example in 2016. There was a study on obstacles to recognition of skills and qualifications. Finally, in terms of giving strategic guidance to the future Bologna Process, the Commission’s recent initiative towards the creation of the European education area is really essential. The main purpose of the European education area is to give a strong boost to learning mobility, to create a Europe in which learning, studying and doing research would not be hampered by borders so as to have a continent where spending time in another Member States to study, to learn and to work, has become the standard. In addition to expanding learning mobility, this ambition requires a number of concrete policy initiatives. I will mention four of them. First, the proposed networks of European universities will act as role models for the implementation of the innovation in teaching and learning, and for the efficient implementation of the Bologna instruments. They will be instrumental to further develop and consolidate the European higher education area and to build synergies with the European research area. Second, the planned Council’s recommendation for automatic recognition of higher and upper-secondary educational qualifications and learning periods abroad will give new impetus to the implementation of one of the three key commitments of the Bologna Process and will further expand learning mobility. Third, the new EU student card will facilitate both mobility and the recognition process. And fourth, an upcoming recommendation will help ensure that in addition to their mother tongue, young Europeans speak two other languages. Language knowledge is a pre-requisite for learning mobility. Thanks to the European education area, we will be able to advance faster among the European Union Member States, then among all of the 48 Bologna countries. But at the same time, it is clear that the European education area indicates the direction to follow and will give new impetus also to the Bologna Process. In this context, the Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament’s call for synergies between those three areas: the European educational area, the European research area and European higher education area. It is expected that in Paris, Bologna ministers will build on this new momentum.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 32, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Silvia COSTA", "mepid": "96917", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank rapporteur Krystyna Łybacka.

But above all, we know that the process underpins the construction of this European area of higher education and the realisation of the Europe of knowledge. However, after 19 years, we have to point out some priorities and I am pleased to collect some of the proposals that have now been suggested to the Commissioner, because some of them go along these lines. I believe that the first point is to improve cooperation between the European Higher Education and Research Area. I believe that the inclusion of doctorates in the Bologna process is a very advanced element, the main link that will also push towards internationalization and strengthening partnerships. However, it also serves a phase of developing the quality of the processes and also the development of the European Higher Education Area, enhancing the social dimension of higher education.

Commissioner! The Bologna process has undoubtedly a number of positive sides, but it is important not to be limited to celebration only and reflect on whether certain original assumptions were indeed quite accurate. After all, representatives of the academic world and researchers analyzing transformations in the field of education have long been alarming that there is a lack of reflection on the side effects of the Bologna process. Numerous publications on the subject include writings such as Teaching in Higher Education and the European Higher Education News Bulletin. I feel that here, in the European Parliament, we do not accept them. Critics of the Bologna process like the British sociologist Stephen Ball point out, among others, that by imposing rigid indicators and standards, academic teaching is judged only by the technical level of performance rather than intellectual values, creative ideas, shaping the personalities of students. This is negatively reflected on the content of the subjects taught, the professional autonomy of teachers and academic freedom suffers. Hence my question to the Commission: whether and in what measure its experts are examining these critical voices.

Weeks ago, the Minister of Education announced changes to allow parents to choose the teaching of Spanish as a vehicle language for their children in Catalan public schools. However, unfortunately, the Resolution that includes the enrolment rules for the next year does not contain any alternative to the Catalan language.

Nobody denies that the Bologna Process has played a very crucial role in the last 20 years to build trust, both between the countries and between the higher education institutions, and this is really essential to promote cooperation and to promote learning mobility. For now, what is the most important for us and what will be our focus for the coming years? It must, and will, ensuring progress in implementing the Bologna Process. At the same time, we will continue to strengthen the capacity-building efforts for Bologna countries outside the EU, and we are trying to work with those countries that have still not fulfilled all of the obligations at this point. Let me refer shortly to Belarus. According to the assessment of the dedicated working group, although some limited progress has been made, the country does not meet the agreed requirements. There is a consensus that Belarus should join the new peer review process, which is foreseen for all 48 member countries, which aims to support the implementation of key Bologna commitments. It is, however, clear that it will also need specific support within the Bologna context to progress faster in this country. Last, but not least, the Commission sees the Bologna Process and the establishment of the European education area as complementary. We believe that the EU initiatives which we will take, within the context of the European education area, will provide a new, very much welcomed impetus to the Bologna Process.

Honourable Members, thank you for putting this on the agenda: it is indeed important to talk about Belarus. EU-Belarus relations have come a long way in the last years. They continue to be driven, as many of you referred to, a policy of critical engagement from our side. We are very attentive, as you are – and thank you for that – to the human rights situation in the country. At the same time, we believe that progress in a variety of fields can be better achieved by means of enhanced cooperation. The release of remaining prisoners in August 2015 was a long-sought step which represented important progress in our relations. Since most of the restrictive measures were lifted in February 2016, EU-Belarus relations developed further. As for the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Belarus Independence, the granting of official permissions by the authorities to hold a meeting and a concert on 25 March was recognised as a positive development. However, the preventive arrests and detentions that took place in the run-up to the commemoration were in contradiction with Belarus’ stated policy of democratisation and its international commitments. While far from being sufficient, in recent years Belarus has taken a number of encouraging steps. These include a pro-active participation in the Eastern Partnership; resumption of the EU-Belarus human rights and other sectoral dialogues; and the signature of the mobility partnership in October 2016. People-to-people contacts, including youth exchanges, will continue to be further encouraged through programmes such as EU Most, Erasmus+, Horizon 2020. Belarus has also played a constructive role in the conflict in and around Ukraine. We have recently observed an increased willingness by the Belarusian authorities to engage with the EU in the dialogue on human rights issues. That has been resumed upon Belarus’ initiative, and the next meeting will take place in June this year in Minsk. This increased willingness for debate has, unfortunately, not led to any measurable legislative improvements in the human rights situation in the country, notably also on the electoral framework that you referred to. We will therefore use the opportunity of the dialogue to reiterate again that democratic principles and fundamental freedoms of expression, assembly, association, including freedom of media (also online) must be fully insured. We will highlight again the need to resume as soon as possible the work on serious, comprehensive and inclusive reform of the electoral framework in line with OSCE commitments and other international standards, and we will continue to call for the introduction without delay of a moratorium on the death penalty and the need to strengthen the independence of the judiciary. There were a few questions by some of you on the Belarusian nuclear power plant in Ostrovets, and I will take this opportunity also to reiterate that nuclear safety issues are an overall EU concern, even more so when these facilities are being constructed on an EU border. Full transparency on the construction process and full cooperation with relevant international organisations, the EU and neighbouring countries are of utmost importance. The EU is using all four as an instrument that we have to address the construction in Ostrovets. The aim is, of course, to ensure that the highest possible safety standards are followed. The EU is, in particular, financing experts who are assisting the Belarusian national regulator during the construction of the power plant and through working with Belarus in the area of nuclear stress tests. Finally, honourable Members, we are now close to finalising the joint EU-Belarus partnership priorities, which will be the first document of this kind between the EU and Belarus – an important building block in our relations, setting the strategic frame for our cooperation in the coming years, in which human rights issues play a very important role. Our work in the biannual format of the EU-Belarus Coordination Group will allow us to monitor progress in our political relations and cooperation, and the fifth meeting is confirmed: it will take place next week in Minsk. The participation of representatives of civil society and experts in the discussions of the Coordination Group has become a standard feature, which is a positive development, and this confirms our support to, and the involvement of, the civil society, which will remain an essential part of our policy. The European Union is ready to assist Belarus in its reform efforts. Tangible steps taken by Belarus to respect universal fundamental freedom, rule of law and human rights will be key in shaping our future relationship with that country, and we will continue to closely observe action by Belarus with regard to freedom of expression and assembly, as well as securing a framework for a free and independent media, as we take forward a policy of critical engagement. We will, equally, continue to call for the Belarusian authorities to engage in constructive and open dialogue with the democratic opposition and civil society organisations to remove restrictions for political activities and ease procedures for registration for political parties and independent organisations in Belarus.

The war on drugs in the Philippines raises a number of issues, which have already been pointed out by international organisations dealing with the protection of human rights. I would like to draw attention to two important aspects. One is the problem of the state monopoly of violence. Acting by means of violence is the responsibility of state bodies, especially the police, yet there is a lot of news in the Philippines that civilians will be vigilante and the public authorities will turn a blind eye to this phenomenon. This is an extremely dangerous and self-provocative process that is easily uncontrollable, but, of course, the citizens' right to security, which is also being defended by the police. The other problem is the lack of legal certainty. If anyone can decide without a court hearing who deserves to be punished or even death for drug abuse, then we are back to prehistoric times, although there were some rules in place.

The issues that have been raised are the issues you raised here: the high number of killings associated with the campaign against illegal drugs, the climate of impunity, the declared withdrawal from the International Criminal Court, the possible reintroduction of the death penalty, as well as a possible lowering of the age for criminal responsibility to nine years. Further, the issue of the general situation of human rights defenders have been raised: the arrest of Senator De Lima and challenges to the freedom of expression and opinion as well as to the independence of institutions, including the impeachment procedures initiated against the chief justice. This has been raised in different declarations and statements by the EU28 Human Rights Council, the High Representative’s spokesperson and we addressed it in a very comprehensive way in the EU Special Incentive Arrangement for Sustainable Development and Good Governance (GSP+) monitoring report that I discussed here with you earlier this year. I have also personally met with Filipino representatives of government on numerous occasions where I have raised the concerns. We are closely monitoring development, especially now regarding the petition of 21 February by the Department of Justice, which includes a list of more than 600 individuals, alleging that they are members of the Communist Party and the New People’s Army. The list includes inter alia, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the Rights of Indigenous People. We note that UN special rapporteurs are protected by specific diplomatic protocols during their United Nations-mandated work. Regarding all the individuals on the list, the EU expects the Government of the Philippines to fulfil, in all its proceedings on the matter, its obligation under national and international law, in particular, the respect of the rule of law and human rights, and to ensure their physical safety. That includes the right to due process, the independence of the judiciary and a fair trial for every individual. We are disturbed by the denial of entry into the Philippines and the subsequent forced deportation from the country of the PES Group Deputy Secretary-General Giacomo Filibeck. He was blacklisted for participating in supposed illegal political activities, where as you know and you also referred to, he was officially invited to attend the congress of Akbayan, an opposition party which is represented both in the Senate and in the House. We immediately raised the matter with the government, as this is the first case of a foreign-national and an EU citizen being expelled from the country for political reasons during the current administration. Human rights violations, including extrajudicial killings, and widespread impunity have been a long-standing problem in the Philippines, as highlighted in the GSP+ report. We remain convinced that both the Philippines and the EU have most to gain from constructive engagement. The partnership and cooperation agreement between the EU and the Philippines entered into force on 1 March this year. And this agreement foresees the establishment of a structured human rights dialogue between the parties, which will be an important forum for addressing all human rights issues. The issue of the GSP+ commitment was raised by several of you, as you remember we discussed this in this plenary in January where we highlighted that indeed, there are several areas of progress by the Philippine Government when it comes to the work on gender equality health, education, social and economic rights, labour rights, fight against corruption, protection of the environment. However – and this was also very clear in the report – extra-judicial killings, especially in the fight against drugs-related impunity, and the possible reintroduction of the death penalty were mentioned. We also addressed recommendations to the Philippine Government and I have also personally conveyed them to the minister that they need to do more to address the issues we have discussed here. We are monitoring the situation closely, and this year’s GSP+ monitoring mission will focus on the issues related to the war on drugs. And the EU will assess recent developments before deciding on the next steps. You can count on the European Commission and on the External Action Service to continue raising these matters with the Philippine Government in a clear and constructive way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 91, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": " I'm closing the debate.

Secondly, we recognize Israel's right to defend itself. We therefore strongly condemn Hamas's recurrent attacks on Israel, as well as the use of civilians as a shield. We also deplore, of course, the loss of life and wounded in recent protests and encourage restraint in the use of force. Our goal is, of course, to prevent an escalation of violence, but that is not what Hamas wants to seek confrontation and to divert the idea of non-violent protests to its own ends. I would also like to emphasize that the reaction of Palestinians in Gaza is significant, since a much smaller number than Hamas hoped participated in the demonstrations of the second week. This shows that Gazans are also protesting against their leaders, that the well-being of the population is not at all a concern of Hamas, which, instead of investing in education and health for the benefit of the population, finances tunnels of terror and rocket fire at Israel.

Palestine continued to live under a military occupation that practiced ethnic cleansing on a daily basis against its people. Enough words, ladies and gentlemen! If Israel refuses the independent investigation called for by Mogherini, the European Union must immediately suspend arms exports and any security and trade agreements with Israel. The European Union could not be an accomplice in the crimes of apartheid against the freedom and equality of Palestinians and Palestinians, against the rights of refugees, as denounced by the legitimate and peaceful BDS campaign and recognized by United Nations institutions. The European Union is obliged to act and punish Israel as South Africa and its apartheid had already been sanctioned.

That is why the EU, together with our partners, has put a strong focus on Gaza in the last month, with two ad hoc liaison committee meetings in Brussels and a successful donor conference on the Gaza desalination plant, with a project on energy and more humanitarian aid. We are also ready if the political conditions are met to assist in the re-opening of the Rafah crossing, which would be a game-changer for freedom of movement in Gaza. However, all these efforts … (President: Excuse me Madam Commissioner. Dear colleagues please, you don’t have to love the Commission but you should respect when the Commissioner is talking. Be quiet. Please, Madam Commissioner.) (Applause) Thank you. Israel needs to allow more access and movement. The Palestinian leadership or the Palestinian factions must assume their responsibilities for the people in Gaza. We are also engaging with Egypt in support of their efforts to bring back the Palestinian Authority to Gaza, but the latest developments show how fragile this process is. The legitimate rights of Palestinians to self-determination in their own state and the legitimate rights of the Israelis to live in peace, security and recognised borders will only be achieved through a negotiated two-state solution. I know this is an objective we all share, and we are looking forward to working with you towards that goal. From this debate I conclude that it is our common goal to ensure a sustainable solution is found for the situation in Gaza, with a return to the Palestinian Authority to resume its full responsibilities on the Strip, and sustained opening of the crossing points. The European Union will continue to support the process in its most effective way with all the instruments that we have. So thank you for this debate, for the work you do highlighting the situation, this is certainly not the last time we will be discussing this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 124, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": " I'm closing the debate.

Therefore, I am deeply convinced that a third-party investigation is not acceptable. Israel has an excellent record of investigating its own military actions and drawing the necessary conclusions to redress any exceptions to the proper implementation of its legitimate right to self-defence. Israel itself is also a vibrant democracy and the army’s activity is a constant source of healthy public and political debate which itself contributes to the necessary oversight. To call for an independent investigation, even before the IDF has completed its own inquiry, is therefore at the very least premature and implies a grave accusation against a friendly country: namely, that its democratic process cannot possibly be trusted. The notion of a possible ICC inquiry is particularly unjustified. Given the legal principle of complementarity under the Rome Statute, the ICC can only initiate cases when a state to whom an alleged perpetrator belonged was unwilling or unable to act.

The new rules will require Member States regularly to check cars circulating on their roads for compliance with relevant environmental and safety standards. And the European Commission will carry out audits of national car type-approval authorities and have the possibility to initiate EU-wide recalls. It will also be able to challenge the validity of inspection systems and issue fines of up to EUR 30 000 per non-compliant car.

Given the Leadership 2020 initiative, does the European Commission have a specific plan to create a comprehensive industrial strategy for the European maritime sector and the shipbuilding sector to support long-term competitiveness, economic stability and growth of this important sector? Is the Commission taking concrete measures to preserve and support the high-tech and high value competitive advantage of European shipbuilding? Does the Commission have clear policies and measures in place today to deal with the threats posed by unfair international competition and the absence of global trade rules? Those are my questions. But of course, I want to thank you here first and foremost for accepting this initiative of mine to discuss these topics and I regret that there are no other colleagues and colleagues from my country because this is especially important for Croatia. And that's why I want to partly look back on Croatian shipbuilding. I know well how important it is to ensure the survival of shipbuilding in Croatia because we are not just talking about preserving jobs, but we are talking about preserving the knowledge and skills of building a ship. Uljanik from Pula, of course, I know best, can become a true European Silicon Valley of shipbuilding smarts and science. The assumption for this is a quick and serious and long-term reaction of state and European institutions. Along with Uljanik, and May 3rd from Rijeka, Brodosplit and HBT from Dalmatia are still companies that have knowledge and market, but need European and national assistance. Namely, the main problem is primarily of a financial nature. And this financing of ship construction and financing of the customer of that ship, as others do, and that is crucial for the survival of shipbuilding, not only in Croatia. That is why I call on the European Commission to design and propose the establishment of a special instrument so that the European building industry can be financed in a competitive way. Often here, Madam Commissioner, we talk about the need to reindustrialize Europe. Instead of first adopting effective measures to save those industries that have synergistic, technological, scientific and economic strength, which can carry the development of Europe in the future. I therefore propose to immediately stop the closure or liquidation of shipyards in the Member States of the European Union. Of course this also means a new definition of measures and criteria, which must be done together by the European Commission and the governments of the Member States concerned. We cannot remain silent as one of Europe's key industries disappears, while at the same time our partners in other parts of the world are pursuing their policy of open subsidies and helping their shipbuilding industry. I understand the need for market and open access because, after all, I am in a family of liberals, but if competition is non-market and illiberal and it does everything to save its industry, then I call for us to do so too. For me, it is completely unacceptable to close my eyes in the face of the constant loss of the share of European producers in the world market. Shipbuilding is a symbol of the connection of European industry because our ship, a European ship, is a common European product in which they are many materials and products that are assembled in a ship in one country and come from a number of other countries. So, let's create a new concept and strategy for shipbuilding conservation immediately.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 165, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, firstly, I want to thank the House for having this opportunity to discuss this important sector of European industry. This is important for most of the European Member States. Let me start my remarks by looking at the wider context. As you maybe remember, in September last year, President Juncker gave a very strong political signal about the need to make our industries stronger, and to make our industries more competitive. Just a few weeks after this, we at the Commission presented and adopted and comprehensive industrial policy strategy. The strategy addresses the remaining gaps with actions that this Commission and this Parliament can still carry out. Even though time is rather short, I think we can still take action here. So, the document: our horizontal industrial strategies are empowering all sectors to innovate and to adapt. The ship building sector is one of many sectors within this framework, and some actions can be the same for all of them, although each sector has its own specifics. Within this framework, we have also taken concrete action to support industrial transformation in specific sectors. And this is an exact example of what we are doing. The shipbuilding and maritime equipment industries are important from both an economic and social perspective as you rightly put it, Honourable Member. They have provided highly qualified jobs contributing to regional economic development, but the global market situation, as we all know, remains difficult for a number of companies in Europe. Against this background, Leadership 2020, as adopted by all relevant stakeholders, constitutes an important initiative focusing on innovation, access to finance skills, market access and some incentives and, maybe, some support for shipyards and the maritime equipment industry. All of those topics and issues are Commission priorities. As regards the first question, on the Commission plan to support long-term competitiveness and growth, our Leadership 2020 programme provides an action plan. Most of the actions are to be decided and implemented by stakeholders themselves, but we are not resting on our laurels and are doing our job. Some actions, especially regulatory ones or negotiations with third countries’ international organisations are for the Commission to initiate or to follow. The second question, on how to preserve and support the high-tech and high-value competitive advantages of European shipbuilding. The very purpose of Leadership 2020 exercise was to identify new opportunities in the areas of innovation, the application of new technologies for the purposes of greening and diversification into new markets. Let me remind you that the recent historic decision by the global shipping industry to cut for the first time its greenhouse gas emissions is both a challenge but also an opportunity. It shows that Leadership 2020, with its strong innovation and greening focus, remains fully valid. More particularly, under the research pillar of Leadership 2020 we have actions to exploit new market opportunities and support zero-emission and energy-efficient vessels. The high-value competitive advantage of European shipbuilding cannot be preserved unless we maintain our human capital and the necessary know-how and related skills. So, in 2015, the Commission endorsed the proposal by the maritime industry to set up a maritime European Sectoral Skills Council as part of the EU-funded project entitled ‘Creating a European Skills Council for the Maritime Technology Sector’. Another initiative which we are quite proud of is maritime technologies, one of the pilot priority sectors under the blueprint for sectoral cooperation on skills. We have chosen a few sectors – seven or eight – for the first round of financing, and the maritime sector is one of them. This was launched under the new skills agenda for Europe in June 2016. Most recently, under the Erasmus+ sector skills alliances, we supported the project on maritime technologies with nearly EUR 4 million funding. This project kicked off in 2018, just a few weeks ago. Regarding your question on the need for a clear policy on the measures to target threats under the unfair international competition. Let me say that, as you also rightly say, the shipbuilding nations in Europe are too weak to cope with the competitive pressure from Asia. Again, this is exactly what our document Leadership 2020 aims to change. The Commission continues to negotiate in the framework of the OECD Working Group on shipbuilding. The sixth EU-China shipbuilding dialogue took place in March 27 last year in Beijing. The objective was to address obstacles limiting business opportunities in China, for instance restrictions on ownership, local content requirements in granting subsidies, weak protection of intellectual property rights, etc. Such exchanges do not bring immediate results, but they represent the only way forward to demonstrate the mutual benefits of fair trade relations to China and other countries. A word on foreign direct investment (FDI): Europe needs to remain open to FDI. However, let’s not be naive, this openness cannot mean allowing transactions by foreign governments or state-owned foreign investors with a hidden agenda. They may seek to gain control of European companies, firms whose activities are critical for the EU or national security and public order. The FDI screening proposal, which is now in the hands of the Parliament and the Council, aims to target this issue. It provides a framework for screening FDI transactions that may pose a risk. Critical infrastructure, like ports and shipyards, are included in the proposal. Finally, a recent study commissioned by the Commission on the new trends in globalisation in shipbuilding and maritime suppliers identifies a number of challenges but also – even more importantly – gives concrete recommendations. This Commission has been discussing those recommendations with industry representatives and we will draw appropriate conclusions. This will also be a part of our discussion at the next MFF.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 166, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to represent the EPP here this afternoon. The EPP are fully committed to industrialisation of Europe and keeping our competitiveness. I would like to congratulate the ALDE Group and support and, indeed, reiterate their question on this crucial issue, which was so well presented to us just now by Ivan Jakovčić. The future of the European shipbuilding sector is under great threat from growing international shipbuilding industries, and only a clear, targeted EU shipbuilding policy offering an integrated and unified approach towards international competition will help Europe to cope with these competitive and societal challenges. We need to develop a collective strategy that rivals that of our Asian counterparts, for example. Ireland, my country, is an island nation and is well served by a thriving shipbuilding industry and can contribute greatly to a joint European effort to re-jig the sector. During the 1820s and 30s Cork, in my constituency, became the most important shipbuilding centre in the country and continued to be important until the 1860s. The Verolme docks at Rushbrooke in Cobh once employed over 1100 people in shipbuilding and many large ships were built and launched from there. This included a number of vessels such as the L.E. Eithne, which has been for the Irish naval service, which has its headquarters nearby. The Verolme dockyard unfortunately closed in 1984 with major job losses to the area and greatly contributed to Ireland’s dwindling shipbuilding sector. The Port of Cork, however, is the second biggest in the country and linked to major other ports. This could contribute greatly to this development. Small boat building, repair and refurbishment and offshore operation and maintenance continue to operate in Cork and throughout Ireland, but the potential beneficial opportunities in reviving this once-thriving shipbuilding industry are endless. Limerick, also in my constituency, has Foynes port, a wonderful port. I’m currently working with the port company CEO, Pat Keating, to get it upgraded to corridor status. Given that it is one of Europe’s most naturally deep ports, it has huge potential. And on May 18 I will be guest speaker at a major conference in Limerick organised by Foynes port. I want to thank the Commission, who will be taking part there are and will be able to see the port for themselves. Also, there are many small fishing ports in my constituency, such places as Kilmore Quay, Castletownbere, Dingle and Dunmore East. They are fishing ports, they are vital for the economy of the constituencies and we must give them every opportunity to develop. Finally, I just want to say, we also have Rosslare harbour in my constituency. This is used for ferries for human beings and for goods and also for haulage. Especially in a post-Brexit era its going become of major importance. So we have an opportunity to do what our President Antonio Tajani once said to stop the industrial massacre of Europe and especially to rebuild our shipping industry.

However, low demand in shipbuilding production is expected in Europe in the next 10 years. This means that this industry will face serious challenges. As far as I can see, there are few of us here in the plenary but the topic doesn’t become less important because of that. The EU is a maritime power and we need to consider all the benefits and perspectives of this sector. Our European project is unique and makes our neighbours wonder about how we ensure such a stable regulatory framework. But we need to keep in mind that the EU is not only about norms and regulations. It is about geopolitics too. The maritime industry still belongs, to a large extent, to power politics. To be a post-modern power in the world of modern nation-states requires us to be geopolitical players too. The study produced on behalf of the European Commission by BALance Technology Consulting shows that the well-being of the European shipbuilding sector has not only economic but also political, security-related and environmental implications for the European Union. This is why today Europe needs a pragmatic and visionary approach towards its shipbuilding. The wise decision has been taken in Europe in recent years to concentrate shipbuilding industry on special high-tech and high-value ships. High technology is going to give us major competitive advantages and take our shipbuilding industry out of yesterday’s world. But we should bear in mind that China also has the political objective of entering the high-tech ship market. It means that we need to think of the next steps to preserve our competitive advantage. In the absence of effective global trade rules we absolutely need a European umbrella to protect our shipbuilders who otherwise will struggle more and more every year. The shipbuilding market remains dollar-based, and that means that we have to protect this industry in Europe from financial imbalances and ensure a fair treatment for our producers. A strong shipbuilding industry also contributes to the new maritime security policies, the EU maritime security strategy, EU Arctic policies and EU naval missions. The EU Member States certainly have strong economic or strategic maritime interests. Therefore, they are reluctant to transfer more competences in this field to the Commission. But if we are to compete with the world’s major maritime powers we need to pool resources and adopt a common action. Brexit will undermine our maritime power to a certain extent, but it can also give us an impetus to go faster in building a common maritime policy. Another reason why we need an effective industrial strategy in the maritime sector is environmental concerns. The EU has an image of the most progressive power in terms of environmental regulation and it should also uphold this principle in its maritime trade relations. This will also contribute to our efforts in promoting environmental standards. Furthermore, climate change is going to uncover new maritime routes in the Arctic region. It will enable much faster transportation from Europe and Africa to Asia, rather than today when the ships pass through the Middle East and South Asia. Current routes will be abandoned as being slower, more expensive and more dangerous. This will immediately shift the competition to the north and to the Arctic region. You have to think about it already today and start to develop new technologies for the new ships able to operate in zones of the extreme North. Colleagues, I also belong to a maritime country. Speaking about the shipbuilding industry in Latvia I need to say that our major current challenges in the shipbuilding sector are the development of workers’ skills and the improvement of the marketing system. Thanks to the historical roots and old traditions of the shipbuilding sector, Latvia conserves its respected position amongst the world’s maritime power, which has been guaranteed by the introduction of some advanced materials, new manufacturing technologies and new designs. But such innovations are not enough to keep Latvian shipbuilding in good economic conditions, especially considering the slowdown of demand in Europe. Today’s shipbuilding sector is in part a knowledge-based economy, and I think that the Latvian Government has to officially state it will adopt a truly European approach to ensure the development of shipbuilding and the welfare of workers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 170, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Urszula KRUPA", "mepid": "28334", "text": " on behalf of the ECR Group. — Mr President! Commissioner! I completely support the concern of the author of the interpellation and the questions to the European Commission regarding the European maritime and shipbuilding sector, even more so that the European Commission's actions have led, unfortunately, with the complicity of previous governments, to the collapse of the shipyard in Poland. Best known for the events of December 70 and the creation of Solidarity, the Gdańsk Shipyard built over a thousand ships during its operation. After regaining independence and joining the European Union, public assistance for important plants proved to be against EU rules and privatisation of the shipyard was demanded so that no public money would be needed, with the threat of collapse and the loss of a hundred dozen thousand jobs. A restructuring proposal was also rejected, giving only time to sell off the shipyard assets to Gdynia and Szczecin, leaving the partly privatised Gdansk Shipyard bought by a Ukrainian company. It lacked the will to rebuild the industry in the maritime economies of other Union States. Systematically destroyed for the last thirty years, the shipbuilding industry is now being rebuilt thanks to Poles, the Government of Poland, being one of the largest of its kind in Europe, covering eight large shipyards in Gdańsk, Gdynia, Szczecin and Świnoujście.

The ongoing recklessness of the British Government with regard to Brexit means that it is only prudent to increase shipping capacity in order to avoid Ireland being punished by the likely difficulties in transit of Irish exports through Britain. So shipping and shipbuilding are of increasing importance to Ireland, north and south. The EU strategy to deal with the economic crisis in shipbuilding has been embraced by Harland and Wolff, the largest shipyard in Ireland, which is in the city of Belfast. They have embraced innovation and technology, they are increasingly green and increasingly diversifying into new markets. A lot of the work done in recent years depends on the shipyard and the main ports in the north, namely Belfast Harbour, Warren Point, Larne and, in my home town of Derry, Foyle port, being plugged into the European market, and they all rely on the European supply chains. Brexit is hugely damaging to that plan and risks seriously damaging the industry. Meanwhile the strategy of the British Government seems to depend more on gunboats than on any forward-looking vision for the sector. On this, like on so many other issues, the British Government seem oblivious to the consequences of Brexit for the north of Ireland. This all needs to be factored into the planning of the EU in the time ahead. Solutions do exist to the threats posed by Brexit for each sector, including shipbuilding. We have presented these solutions through our case for designated special status for the north to remain within the EU post-Brexit. In that vein, we have also proposed a system of red and green channels that complement existing infrastructure at ports and could be used to address goods entering and leaving Ireland, north and south. I want to acknowledge the sterling work that is being done by MEP Liadh Ní Riada with regard to protecting the goods that are transiting from Ireland into Britain or via Britain into the EU. So this system would be used for goods transiting through Britain from Ireland to the rest of the EU and would therefore protect the integrity of the single market and allow for east-west trade to continue. We do not want to see the border dividing Ireland being reinforced, nor do we want to see the Irish Sea between Britain and Ireland as an obstacle. Need I remind Members that the Titanic was built in the Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast? Belfast city centre and its Titanic quarter have, as a result of the peace process, community development and European funding, seen a transformation for the better. However, on its first voyage the Titanic hit an iceberg on the North Atlantic and sank.

We do not see anything in such plans. First of all, in the plans of the European Commission, I am thinking of interference, nonsensical and superfluous arrangements and opposition to national sovereignty. We stand for the free market economy. Companies themselves are responsible for their success and should not be in the way of European bureaucrats, bureaucrats who have no idea what healthy competition and market forces really are. We are opposed to transferring powers to the European Union. We are opposed to wasting European taxpayers' money by opposing better knowledge in supporting unprofitable companies and bankrupt shipyards. In the past, it has been shown in other sectors that State aid and subsidies are merely postponement of execution. It is often no more than a temporary swab for bleeding. Think, for example, of the aircraft industry and the automotive industry. The Netherlands too has become wise in terms of State aid due to damage and shame. In the 1980s, the Dutch taxpayer paid billions and billions of guilders to support shipyards in our own country, ultimately without success. Large shipyards were closed after a few years and tens of thousands of jobs were lost. So all the taxpayers' money would have been for nothing in the end. In recent years, the shipping industry has flourished again in the Netherlands. Not thanks to the government, but thanks to the power of entrepreneurship and innovation in the sector itself. Ultimately, it is up to the market and not to the government to determine where and when which goods are produced. It is a question of supply and demand, price and quality.

We need such efforts, we need to preserve these traditions. We need to keep those jobs. We have competition — not very fair — from countries outside the European Union who are quite logically and quite normally trying to enter these markets.

I think that the shipyard and maritime industry is so important that we probably need to take action – even more action than we’ve being doing so far – for the next 18 months. As I mentioned our LeaderSHIP 2020 programme – which is the right framework and which provided the necessary orientation to our industries to embrace the new challenges, new opportunities to discuss innovation, the circular economy, and digitalisation – I am confident that while of course it cannot be fast, because we are jointly discussing it and making joint efforts with all stakeholders involved, it will continue to deliver useful results in the future. Member States, of course, have a key role in ensuring that the industry meets new challenges and takes advantage of the opportunities. Of course, we have to continue to work both with the Member States, with the Parliament, and with the stakeholders in the industry, but I can commit to you that I will look in those fields where our activities should be stronger and where our action can really make a difference, including access to finance, including access to markets. We are doing a lot on skills. We are doing a lot on access to markets, but I think that we will maybe get some new perspective while creating them, discussing the new budget generally on the industry – but in this framework also for the shipyard industry – so this is not the end of our discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 177, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": " The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 178, "date": "2018-04-19.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": " I declare the session of the European Parliament adjourned.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}]
