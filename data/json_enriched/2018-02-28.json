It is a new, unacceptable attack on press freedom, which is a founding value of our democracy. This murder comes within months of the tragic murder of Maltese journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia. Ján Kuciak exercised his profession with passion and courage. Throughout his brief but promising career, he was conducting inquests into cases of suspicious funding and tax evasion. He sought the truth with determination, without looking in anyone's face. Police stated that he almost certainly was killed to stop his inquests. On behalf of Parliament, I want to say strongly that we all have a duty to continue its battle for the truth. It is not permissible today for a journalist to be killed within the European Union because he is playing his profession. How can we condemn those who intimidate and imprison journalists everywhere in the world, if we fail to guarantee freedom of the press and the possibility to safely carry out their jobs to journalists Europeans? I am counting on the Slovak authorities to do everything possible to get to the truth, including calling for international cooperation between policies. On behalf of the European Parliament, I can assure that, as with Daphne Caruana Galizia, we will not stop voicing our voice, continuing to ensure that all the perpetrators are brought to justice. As it happened to remember Daphne Caruana Galizia, I ask you to join me in a minute's silence. (The House, standing, observes a minute's silence) Unfortunately the last week has been full of negative news. Boko Haram terrorist group attacked a school in the North again East of Nigeria, and as a result of this attack over one hundred girls disappeared. It is a kidnapping that brings to mind the dramatic memory of schoolgirls kidnapped in Chibok, in 2014. The European Parliament strongly condemns this attack and calls for the release of these girls. Every child should be guaranteed the right to go to school in a safe and free environment. President Buhari called it a national disaster, but I have no fear to call it a worldwide humanitarian disaster. This tragic event should prompt us to engage more concretely at the political, financial and military level with our African partners in the fight against terrorism. I must also inform you of an incident which saw our colleague Ska Keller in Bulgaria a few weeks ago. Mr Keller was the subject of a statement by Minister Simeonov calling for her to be expelled from the country because of her participation in a protest rally against the construction of infrastructure in Pirin national park in Bulgaria. Just informed of this, I immediately intervened at the Bulgarian government and received assurance that Simeonov's statements do not represent the government's position. The incident thus resolved. I would like to reiterate that the freedom to express their opinion is a fundamental right for any citizen of the European Union, particularly those who, like Mr Keller, are elected by the people and represents the people who represent citizens. This freedom is the foundation of our democracy and entails the right to differ, to demonstrate and also to protest. I thank the Bulgarian Government for immediately distancing itself from these statements and I hope that such episodes will not happen again in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Bruno GOLLNISCH", "mepid": "1164", "text": " — Mr President, I very much appreciate the comments you have just made.

On the 20th of this month, we were able to read in the EU Observer that there is, and we have seen, a letter from Vice-President Katainen saying that on 25 October last year he met Mr Barroso, former President of the Commission, and that this meeting would have been about trade and defence. Now Mr Barroso had a problem when he left the Commission and started working for Goldman Sachs. The ad hoc committee, the Commission's ethics committee, said that we can live with it because Mr Barroso has solemnly promised never to lobby Goldman Sachs with the European institutions. We would now like to add this item to the agenda to know exactly what has happened. Is Mr Barroso's lobbying activity for Goldman Sachs or not? And what exactly was the content of the conversation? My group's preference is to add it to the agenda this afternoon.

Each new escalation brings a new humanitarian crisis and a new level of horror. Unfortunately it is now evident, as we have been saying for months and years, that the war is far from over, and a political solution is more urgent than ever.  The situation in Eastern Ghouta, where over 400 000 people are in dire need, is of extreme concern to me as Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid. I had hoped that the tragedy experienced in Aleppo last year was behind us, but unfortunately what is happening in Eastern Ghouta as we speak proves otherwise. The ongoing violence and human suffering are unacceptable. We have worked endlessly to stop the massacre and we went public in order to increase the pressure on the regime and its supporters. I issued a joint statement together with the High Representative on 19 February, and the High Representative also made a declaration on 23 February, on behalf of 20 of our Member States. We are equally concerned about the reports that chlorine gas is being used in Eastern Ghouta. Investigation in the field should definitely be supported. The EU sanctions regime has already been used to target perpetrators and can be mobilised again. The resolution adopted by the United Nations Security Council last Saturday is an essential step forward, but it is only a first step. As highlighted by the High Representative, it is now essential to implement a ceasefire to allow a genuine humanitarian pause for at least 30 consecutive days throughout Syria. For that reason, earlier this week the High Representative wrote to the three guarantors of the Astana process, Russia, Turkey and Iran. They have committed to creating four de—escalation zones and they have a special responsibility to work for an immediate ceasefire. This will enable safe, sustained delivery of humanitarian aid, as well as services and medical evacuations for the critically ill and the wounded, in accordance with applicable international law. We, the European Union, the principal humanitarian donor, are maintaining our commitment to delivering strictly on the basis of needs across the whole of Syria. In Eastern Ghouta we have been providing assistance across sectors including health, food and protection. We are in constant contact with our partners operating there on the ground. These include five UN agencies, the ICRC as always, and five international and local governmental organisations, which have pre-positioned the requisite emergency supplies to be delivered as soon as access is granted. I reiterated that it is a matter of the utmost urgency to allow access for our partners to deliver the long—awaited vital assistance. I am alarmed to witness the human suffering while assistance is waiting in warehouses. This is completely unacceptable.  The situation in Eastern Ghouta illustrates the plight of the three million vulnerable people trapped in besieged and hard-to-reach areas. I totally agree with you that it is time to act. I look forward to your support in continuing to call on the parties to the conflict to respect the UN resolution and allow humanitarian aid to be delivered.

There is a sense that the lives and the suffering of civilians dying under the bombs and chemical attacks of Assad, Russia and Iran-backed militias in Homs, Aleppo, Zabadani, Madaiya, Idlib and now Ghouta are just numbers – the casualties of a war without restraint.  The violation of international humanitarian law can be tolerated for some without any consequences for the future. You are so wrong. Our responsibility is greater than we are prepared to assume. All parties are guilty in the failure to prevent the worst bloodshed of the 21st century. The warning signals of a humanitarian catastrophe in Ghouta have been there for a long time, but the world has chosen to accept it with fatalism – tragic fatalism, I would say. I feel shame for those who are selling us this shameful apathy towards the Syrian massacre in the name of the so-called fight against terrorism. Shame on those who dare to close their eyes and hope that Russia will solve all their problems. You are deluded. The war in Syria might only be the beginning of war after war, which could be even worse. This is a place for wars. Do not underestimate the war and the traumas inflicted on all Syrian people and on the region because of the involvement of an increasing number of local and regional actors. What happens today will have repercussions in the long term. Refugees will not stop. The EU will continue to play its chronic inability to act. The UN Resolution asking for an immediate ceasefire continues to be ignored by Assad and his allies. A so-called ceasefire of only five hours has been implemented by Russia. This ceasefire was a poisoned gift that only served to allow Assad’s troops to advance on the ground. This move only side-lined the UN as a decision-maker and allowed Russia to impose its Pax Russica and further establish and strengthen its authority and role in the region. After Syria vetoed the UN Resolution on chemical weapons used in Syria, we have evidence today of the selling of arms, including chemical weapons, from North Korea to Syria. One question now hangs in the air: are we really unable today to make sure that at least the embargo on the selling of arms to Syria is respected? This is a devastating question mark for our Union and for humanity.  Finally, I will dare to look cautiously to the future. The only bridge to the future of the Syrian people is a ceasefire and a UN-led political solution, which includes UN monitoring and an enforcement mechanism.

It is not a solution, but it is a reality that cannot be denied. Four hundred thousand civilians are trapped in Eastern Ghouta. They are starving and they are being bombed by Syrian and Russian forces, despite the UN ceasefire. Ghouta was a so-called de-escalation zone for those besieged in Aleppo, Idlib and other areas of the country in the past, but instead, the moving of people into one area seems to have put a target on their head, and the world, the EU, cannot stand by. We are also seeing the use of chemical weapons again, but what are we doing? After endless vetoes, last week we saw Russia stalling the UN Security Council Resolution for other criteria that it wanted. Clearly Putin only plays by his own cynical rules: together with Iran, it had forced an exception which allows for so-called terrorists to be targeted, despite the ceasefire. In reality that means that women, children, hospitals and schools are now accused of being terrorists, or harbouring them. This cruelty must stop. There must be, and there will be, consequences for Assad, Putin and Khamenei for what they are doing. We must do more as Europeans to reach a political solution negotiated under UN auspices. Accountability for the brutality should be our key priority. There cannot be peace without justice. But now, first and foremost, we have to actively push for guarantees that make sure humanitarian aid reaches those in need. The EU, as the biggest donor of humanitarian and development aid, must look into the terrible cases of sexual abuse of the most vulnerable refugees by aid organisation workers that are supposed to help them and not attack them. It is an absolute scandal, which we must seek an investigation into. Frankly, it is time, after the nth debate we are now having, to stop repeating empty phrases. We must take a more active and stronger political role for the EU and prioritise peace, accountability and safety for those on the run from the horrendous violence and sexual attacks that we are witnessing today.

I can almost agree with what you said at the beginning of the debate. The problem for me only arises if we now have to demean more than 300 000 deaths in these seven years — men, women, children — men, women, children — in every escalation in a war that has been going on for seven years — men, women, children — Millions of people have left Syria, millions of people flee within Syria, and 13 million people are waiting for our help. If we know that 400 000 people are trapped in East Gutha, who are excluded from all medical and humanitarian care, then the question arises: what can we really do in concrete terms? I have the impression, even though I follow the discussion like this — and I do not want to insinuate anyone, but let us not define anybody by now, or if there is no danger, that anyone who is active, who lives only in Syria at all, from one side, from the other side again as a terrorist is considered? How are we going to break this cycle anyway? Everyone is ultimately a terrorist — always from the point of view of others. And the result is that the war is further intensified, that new occasions are being found, that bombs fall again, missiles fall, and that poison gas is ultimately used without anyone being punished. This isn't the first use of poison gas. Also the previous use of poison gas — what consequences have they led to? Did they mean that we, as the European Union, have really done everything possible to stop any form of arms export in the end, in order to speak out clearly against this? Have they also led us to adopt a clear stance towards some of the countries that have really actively participate in this game — and it's a bad game, it's not just a dirty game, it's a really deadly game — that we take clear positions? By that I mean Russia, but I also mean Turkey, I mean other countries, I mean Iran, and I also mean a whole range of other countries. We're talking about East Gutha. That is right and necessary, and we must immediately ensure that there is no end. We talked about Afrin last time. Now we pretend that these are two completely different things, like they don't happen in one country. But they are people in this country, and I don't care who they belong to, which ethnicity they belong to. The point is that we have to help, that we have to make sure that people can live. The last point I would like to make is that if we are here in favour of ending immediately with any form of military attack of violence against people in Syria, then, damn it, I do not understand why we have a problem within the European Union at all, about the Syrian refugees in our Union to talk. Then I demand that we do everything possible, especially the injured, to help the traumatized people and really do something for them.

Thousands of sick, injured children literally starving on the smoking rubble of an unstoppable area. A hell on earth that covers us with shame. Eastern Ghouta, the Damascus orchard, has become its cemetery. Cemetery of innocent civilians, but also of the ability of the international community, and particularly Europe, to put an end to the slaughter that bloody Syria, a country that continues to bury its children, from Kobane to Aleppo, from Raqqa yesterday to Ghouta today. The international community deserves very little its name as a community. It only notes its inability to weaken foreign godparents, those who blow on the embers of conflict and despise the rules of law and border lines. Ah! He must tremble with fear, Assad, comfortably settled in the 35,000 m2 of his presidential palace, only a few kilometers from the hospitals bombed by his army, transformed into mowers in which hundreds of wounded are piled up. In this bloody conflict, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union seems powerless, tragically powerless. It seems inaudible in New York and Geneva, it seems erased against Moscow, Tehran and Ankara. She is absent from the Astana talks. The European Union needs to do more, much more. It must do more with Russia, which, recognizes, calls the testimonies of the besieged people as “mass psychosis”. Putin, the great puppeteer, finds herself overwhelmed by his creature, Assad. It is in his interest to find a political solution at this cemetery with ever-enlarged aisles. Europe must also do more with regard to Iran. If that country wants to engage in a constructive relationship with the European Union, we expect it to play its very great influence on the Assad regime to do so cease the massacre. It is in the interest of all, including Iranians, in a logic of openness. The European Union must also do more vis-à-vis Erdoğan, who dropped his army, equipped largely by ourselves, against the Kurds of Syria in Afrin. Finally, Europe must continue to hammer loudly, but also behind the scenes, that adding war to war will not solve anything and that only a political solution can put an end to the Syrian tragedy.

While the Syrian regime has not been tender to its enemies, the myth of “moderate Islamist rebels” must be put to an end. Mohammed Allouche, who holds Ghouta civilians hostage with his Jaich al-Islam group, is no more moderate than the leaders of ISIS or Al-Nusra. In her letter to us last night, Mrs Mogherini speaks of Nasser Al-Hariri. But what do you hope to negotiate with this new Saudis puppet placed at the head of the “Syrian National Coalition”? Saudi Arabia, which commits atrocities in Yemen and supports and funds, directly or indirectly, a number of Islamist factions. Today, seven million people live in Damascus, where many Syrians have taken refuge. They too are bombarded daily from neighbourhoods or suburbs that are held by Islamists. The Christian district of Bab Touma is one of the privileged targets of the so-called “rebels”. Hospitals, schools and orphanages are given priority. Last week, the Red Crescent siege received more than ten shells. Among the victims are Lama Fallouh, the courageous director of the opera, who continued to work to maintain these cultural offerings that Islamist barbarians honest. Which western capital would it accept to be bombed by a rebel suburb? What can we do now to save civilians as much as possible? First, we must ensure the total defeat of the jihadists, eradicate them to the last, and transitional means either humanitarian corridors to evacuate the inhabitants of Ghouta, or temporarily leave an exit door for Islamists to return to Idlib.

As you said in Italy, we have seen – and the United Nations has reported – almost 250 000 new displacements since December. Out of 2.4 million civilians there, half are now internally displaced. Food and shelter are also in short supply. I could certainly continue this list to include other areas, for instance, the berm along the border with Jordan, which is very close. All this gives enough evidence that we are still far from the normalisation of the situation in Syria. Unfortunately, the humanitarian dimension will therefore feature prominently again at the second conference in Brussels on Syria and the region, to take place on 24 and 25 April, where we will need to discuss how to improve our assistance and how to mobilise funding beyond this year, 2018. Needs are likely to increase further. This is the humanitarian situation on the ground and this is why the conference is an opportunity for us, as chair, to further work together towards the shared objective of supporting the Syrians in need, their host countries and communities, and promoting a sustainable political solution. But I totally agree with you, and let us also be clear that only a political solution to this crisis can end the suffering of the Syrian people. We must support and relaunch the Geneva talks because that they are the only realistic path towards peace. In the present conference we will also work to support Geneva, keeping together the humanitarian and the political track. We have been – and will be – at the forefront of the work to reach sustainable peace in Syria, with you and all the EU institutions and Member States together. I strongly believe that Syrians deserve this and we have a political and moral duty to keep Syria at the core of our common action and our common foreign policy. This is the hard reality on the ground. All of us know all the obstacles to engaging more as Europeans in this unbelievable situation, but by following this pragmatic path, we can continue our work together in order to see results on the ground as soon as possible. My last point is about sexual abuse by some organisations. Maybe you do not know that the Commission expects our partners to abide by strict ethical and professional rules, codes of conduct and principles. There is no change in our position. We definitely take a zero—tolerance approach across the board to any allegation of misconduct by organisations receiving our funding. Last week we sent a letter to all EU—funded humanitarian organisations to remind them of their strict obligations. The letter requests a detailed description of all measures that they have put in place. At the same time, we are ready to review and, if necessary, cease funding any partner who is not living up to the required high, critical ethical and professional rules and standards, as we have already established. So, we are following the situation and I strongly believe that we have to be very tough regarding any such incidents in order, above all, to sustain our reputation as humanitarians.

Last Friday, I explained to the informal European Council our proposal on the composition of this Parliament in the next parliamentary term and our positions on other institutional issues and on next multiannual financial framework. I thank President Tusk for having wanted to inform me yesterday about the discussions that took place during the working breakfast. I am pleased to announce that the proposal on the future composition of Parliament, which we approved by a large majority during the last part-session in Strasbourg, has been welcomed in a positive way by the Heads of State and Government, who judged it sensible and balanced. So I would like to thank once again the rapporteurs Danuta Maria Hübner and Pedro Silva Pereira for their excellent work. To the Council, I stressed that Parliament's proposal ensures that no country will lose seats compared to the current situation and takes into account the political need to have a more reduced Parliament in following the exit of the United Kingdom, the need to adapt the composition of Parliament to the demographic changes in recent years in the various Member States, and the opportunity to keep a margin for future allocation of seats to newly accessed countries. I am convinced that this proposal will get swift approval from the European Council, not least because the decision currently in force, which is from 2013, applies only to the current legislature and So we need to adopt a new one in good time for next year's European elections. Questioned on the subject, I also explained that in its proposal Parliament did not take up the idea of establishing transnational lists, a suggestive idea but which, for the moment, does not have the support of a majority within the Assembly. Heads of state and government are likely to return to the issue in the future, perhaps in the run-up to the 2024 election. I also recalled that Parliament submitted a proposal to revise the electoral law as early as 2015 and we hope that the European Council will at least approve the parties on which there is consensus on time useful for the next election. As you know, the Council also discussed Spitzenkandidaten. I stressed the broadly majority position in Parliament that the introduction of this practice in the 2014 elections was an important step on the way to a more political Europe, from which you don't have to go back. Not only should the practice be maintained, but it should be improved in order to strengthen the legitimacy of the Commission through a fiduciary link with the stronger Parliament. If we want to reduce the distances that exist between the institutions and the citizens today, we must give them the convinced feeling that we are part of the decisions on the future government of the European Union. This is, however, a matter which remains problematic for the European Council, since it is a constant right to find ways to save the prerogatives given to the Council by the Treaty. But I believe that it is possible to come to an agreement. At the informal European Council we also discussed the new multiannual financial framework. I said that the Europe we wish must be able to have the necessary financial resources to achieve the objectives we have agreed. I reaffirmed that the post-2020 budget must be a political budget, based not on merely redistributive logic but on a clear strategy and precise objectives. We must first make political choices and only after establishing the budgetary resources necessary to achieve them, not the other way around. I said that Parliament's priorities are those of our citizens and it is clear that the new The financial framework must allow the Union to emerge strengthened by the crises of the recent past and face new challenges, such as efficient control of migration, combating youth unemployment and internal and external security, so also the fight against terrorism and of course the issue of defence and combating climate change. Next to the new challenges remain traditional ones, such as youth unemployment, which remains a serious problem. We all agree that the new financial framework should be aimed at fostering well-being, sustainable long-term economic growth, quality employment and innovation, as well as which, of course, to promote the economy through social and territorial cohesion. I stressed that Parliament also recognises the fundamental importance of a modern and environmentally friendly common agricultural policy, which can ensure food security and guarantee the survival of rural population. During the debate, I also stressed how important it is for us to focus on our own resources. I said that the European Parliament has a position that points to 1.3% of the European GDP, and therefore more money in the budget, but I insisted on the issue of own resources, as we had also agreed during the informal meeting I had with the chairmen of the groups. I also indicated what they are: web tax, environmental import tax and speculative financial transaction tax — I cited these three examples. As regards the timetable, I have illustrated the majority position within Parliament, namely the desire to have a vote in the House on the budget before the next European elections. The technical times are there, we will have to make the most of the political ones. I said that we are ready to do whatever is possible if this becomes our common goal. These, in summary, are the things I referred to name and on behalf of Parliament after meeting once again informally with all the chairmen of the groups, precisely because, given the delicacy of the matter and its importance, I preferred truly make more and more the majority spokesman in this House saying, where there were majority choices, that they were choices made by majority.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 38, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, one would almost assume that there’s an election going on somewhere. Thank you very much, Mr President. I can be very brief on the institutional issues because the Commission concurs fully with how you reflected the discussion at the summit. I want to comment on a few points. Spitzenkandidaten are apparently now part of the Italian language as well as of the English language. The other German word that I know is in both the Italian and the English languages is angst, but probably there’s no relation between the two. What do I have to say about this? As far as the Commission is concerned, this is something that was done in 2014 and therefore is established. We at the Commission have to add that the Treaty is leads the way here, so the Commission is, if you could put it that way, a child of Parliament and the European Council. So of course we want to strengthen our position in Parliament and our democratic legitimacy, as you’ve explained, Mr President, but we also have to face the reality that the European Council has a say as well. What we said in our communication is that it does not follow that the person who heads the political group that ends up with the most seats in the European Parliament automatically becomes a Commission President. A majority in the European Parliament might be a factor. Somebody else might be chosen if they secured a majority in the European Parliament and could also be carried by the European Council. That is how way we have put it in our communication. The leaders did not decide, for now, on the size of the next Commission, although the 2013 decision means that they will have to come back to this issue before the next Commission is put in place, and the issue of a transnational constituency has also been left open. I know that the majority in Parliament is not in favour, but the matter was discussed and we will surely come back to it ahead of the 2024 elections; and I must point out that the leaders do not have much of an appetite at present for the idea of a double-hatted President of the Commission and the European Council.  Finally, I just want to welcome the renewed interest which the leaders have expressed in different forms of outreach and engagement with our citizens. We are really looking forward to sharing our experience with Member States, especially in view of the new impetus that Member States have given to this. We’ve run, I think, 478 citizens’ dialogues so far and before the end of our term we want to do 500 more.  The second topic on the agenda was our future budget. Discussion among the leaders was less abrasive than some might have expected, and that should be welcomed: they all understand that at the end of the day we will need a budget. Many Member States expressed a willingness to increase the level of their contributions. Some did not. At the same time the Commission made it clear that savings on redeployments would be needed for some parts of the budget if new priorities were going to be properly funded. When we, as politicians, formulate new priorities, we also have to face the fact that other issues will then have to be deprioritised, and that has financial consequences. So this is going to be a major task. We will make our formal proposals for the future budget by the beginning of May at the latest. At last week’s meeting, we stressed the need to decide on the final deal and yes, in some cases, agreed trade-offs between different deserving causes before the next European elections. But I also note that opinions diverge on that point and that many people would like to have the decision after the European elections. I see Mr Verhofstadt, who has also, if I’m correct, expressed his view in favour of having the decision after the elections.  Why do we want to take the decision before the elections? Because the current MFF was decided upon only at the very end of 2013, which meant that the programmes putting it into effect could not be brought into being until 2014, so the first year was actually lost when it came to actually getting money out into the real world, which we need urgently to do, to get money invested in our society in order to make sure that convergence starts happening again in Europe. One of the fundamental threats to the future of the European Union is divergence within and between Member States, and we need to put  taxpayers’ money to good use to restart the engine of convergence in our Union. Of course the benefits of EU membership go far beyond the budget. Some of these benefits can be quantified, others not. I think that we should be talking more in terms of the EU dividend, which is not just a balance sheet, but much more than that. Perhaps if we can talk more in terms of EU dividends we can also come to an agreement on how the EU budget should be structured in the future. Not everybody can recognise that this is in everybody’s interest.

I am quite fine with the outcome of the meeting on Friday. That is why I regret that he is not present with us, because, first of all, in the preparations for 2019, the EPP Group is very thankful that we can agree on the composition and that we have legal certainty for 2019, which is important. Secondly, as regards the Spitzenkandidat, the role is clear. The Council is insisting on its role, which is legally defined in the Lisbon Treaty, and that is fine. However, I also see that the same personalities who stressed, in the informal meeting on Friday, the role of the Council are part of the party meetings, and there they are supporting the process to nominate candidates in the party format. My party will do this in Helsinki in November. That is agreed upon and that is what we will do. Frans Timmermans explained once again what parliamentary democracy means. It is not the biggest group which will have the chance, but only the candidate who can organise a majority will have the chance to be elected as Commission President. However, one thing is again crystal clear: nobody will be elected from this Parliament and from the next Parliament who was not, before the elections, put forward as a candidate from a democratic party. That is a principle. It is fixed and it has now been approved.  The innovation that is ahead of us is that we need not only candidates, but we also really need attractive programmes from the different political parties to show people an alternative and to make a really European campaign. On MFF, things are on the right path. It was a constructive discussion. First of all, we have to make the EU more effective and spend money in a more effective way. Then there are the new tasks on the table, and we will need fresh new money.  I sometimes hear the argument that the EU will be smaller. Dear friends, when I look at the tasks on the table – the demands for the African Fund, for the Defence Fund and for strengthening Frontex – I do not see how Europe will be smaller in the next MFF. There are lot of tasks on the table which have to be financed. The last point I want to make in my intervention today is about the most important discussion this week on Brexit, because tomorrow Theresa May will make a speech on this subject. When I look to the outcome and the developments in the last weeks in the British debate, the key question is still what the new relationship between the European Union and Great Britain will look like. One principle is clear for us: a country outside the EU cannot have the same standards and the same rights as a country inside the European Union. It is also clear for us that an endless transition period is not acceptable to us. That is why we welcome today’s presentation of a possible Leave Treaty. One point is still open, and that is the question of what these long-term relationships will look like. We need clarity on this. We hope that, when we listen tomorrow to Theresa May, we will have more clarity, for example on the future relationship with the City of London and how the Open Skies will look in the future. There are many questions on the table and we need a clear idea.  I have to pick up one message we received from the UK Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. When I look at what he said, especially on the question of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, I must say that a politician should try to solve problems and not create problems. Don’t play with the achievements of the past; don’t play with the peace process; don’t play with the future of the young generation in Northern Ireland. The EPP will be on the side of the Irish people: we will not accept a hard border, and will not risk the peace process. That is what we want to achieve. Europe is ready.

Frans Timmermans on behold of the Commission, thank you for drawing the conclusions, a lot of which we share, not all of them but a lot. Buy the main question today is: where is the European Council? I haven't met the European Council on the floors of this chamber. I have not seen them here. Thanks to our Bulgarian colleagues, there is not even an empty chair and there is not even an elephant in the room. There's just Nothing. I do not regret that, my dear colleague Manfred Weber — I find it a scandal — because this is about the future of Europe, and where is the President of the European Council? He will learn to take this House seriously, and he and his colleagues will learn to take this Chamber of European Parliamentarians seriously because it's about our common future, and we will not give in on these children of procedures. Europe's future is about money — of course too. Therefore, it is completely incomprehensible why so little comes out of this. These informal summits have been introduced to make it easier for you to speak more confidently. But what is the result? What are the formal summits supposed to look like when the informal summits are already giving so little to light? Of course, we agree to take on new tasks. We know, of course, that Europe needs to take care of a decent refugee policy, that we need to ensure that migration issues are sensible. And that we take care of security, old security issues — new security issues. This is our clear position. But how can this be done without additional funding? Where is the commitment of the ladies and gentlemen in the European Council to allow us more of this? And in particular: Where is the question of own resources? Thank you, Mr President, for mentioning this again, that is how we have discussed. But why — it is in the hands of the governments of the European Council — not finally a financial transaction tax that pays into Europe's budget? Why not finally get a tax on the multinationals who do business in e-commerce without paying decent taxes? It is high time for this, and that is exactly what has to happen, exactly what has to be implemented. We are waiting for this. The European Council says that it does not agree or cannot guarantee that the top candidates will also be proposed at the end of the day or that the top candidates will be elected by the top candidate. We have to say to Mister Tusk and the Colleagues: We could not care less. Why? We could not care less, because the question of whether the European parties nominate top candidates is not the property of the European Council, but of European civil society, and the parties and citizens will take a decision on this, and not the governments and ladies of the European Parliament. Rat, it won't be like this! That is why I make it very clear that this House has undertaken not to choose anyone who has not faced this democratic competition for programmes and for people. We in the Socialist Group are certainly not going to do so because we were the pioneers of this process. We will not choose anyone who escapes democratic competition. We will no longer approve of backroom events.

Can I come back another time? (Referring to remarks made by members of the EFDD Group.) So what came out of last Friday’s Council meeting? A clear signal that there is still a long way to go to persuade Member States to sign up to a bigger budget and also how to select the next Commission President. A number of EU Member State governments know that their voters do not want them to simply sign blank cheques to fund the ambitions of the Commission and the leaders of two or three of the larger Member States. Members of this House can no longer dismiss those voters, those politicians and those governments who question the agenda of political integration or simply label them as being anti-EU, for once you step outside the EU bubble, it is clear that the call for more Europe, whatever the problem, is the voice of an elite, not the voice of citizens in many of our countries.  National governments and voters want to feel that they get value out of the EU for what they pay in. Not all of them want to see a 1950s agenda of political integration. On the whole, the voters want to see a budget that is well managed and matches their priorities, a budget that provides security and well—functioning asylum and immigration systems, and a budget that encourages a cleaner environment, innovation and job creation. But – and members of the ECR Group would want me to be very clear on this point – a budget should not be used to buy solidarity, to bribe Member States into taking asylum seekers, or to control or punish the actions of individual Member States, especially when the Member State pushing for the policy itself broke the rules and, in the process, nearly destroyed the EU’s asylum system.  So, as President Tusk has already admitted, agreeing a budget before the next election is probably unrealistic, but even if all of you here and the EU institutions cannot agree on a budget, those politicians facing their electorates in 2019 should all be clear about what modernising the budget really means, about how the EU will face the massive hole after the UK leaves, and whether the EU budget will be one of coercion rather than cooperation between 27 equal Member States. So the ECR Group’s question to the Council and the Commission is simple: Is the EU facing a future where decisions continue to be made by all 27 Member States, or a future where decisions are dictated by the few?

Thank you Mr Kamall. Secondly, I think we have to pay you, Mr President, a double salary in February because you have taken over the role of Mr Tusk today and that is significant because you, Mr Timmermans, spoke of the idea of ‘one hat’ in the European Union, and we have proved that it is possible for the Commission to double-hat for the Council. The only other thing, maybe, is that you can go over to the other side once, and then come back. But I will not go over the whole discussion that you had in that informal Council about Spitzenkandidaten and transnational lists. I have already said what I think about that, namely that you are making an enormous strategic mistake. You are endangering the Spitzenkandidat concept by not embedding it in a democratic process in a transnational list. The reality is that the Spitzenkandidat continues to be a toy of political parties and again between the Council on the one hand and Parliament on the other, but there is no legitimacy on the democratic front. Transnational lists provide precisely that – putting the Spitzenkandidat concept into a democratic process so it is our people who decide who is elected, and then the European Council could no longer object to the outcome of such an election. But okay: Rome was not built, as you know Mr President, in a day, and the same is true of transnational democracy. We will come back to this in 2024. On the issue of the budget, I have been involved three times in the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), twice as a member of the Council and once as a Member of the European Parliament, and my fear is very simple, Mr Timmermans: that it will be business as usual. It will be a budget for seven years in which the next Parliament will have no say – no say in five years! Secondly, I fear it will be again a list of 50-60 rebates, exceptions, earmarkings, and exceptional monies to buy the support of all the Member States, and 80% of it will be money paid by the Member States going back to the Member States, and not going to the new priorities that we have – border management, innovation, migration, defence and things like that. So my appeal to all the political groups represented here is: let’s break the cycle of this European budget. Let’s make an agreement, together with the Commission, on the priorities. Secondly, on conditionality: will we continue to hear, for example, that Mr Orban is misusing European money to build a football stadium in his town, or to make his friends and family multimillionaires on the basis of European money? No! Let us establish conditionality: if you don’t accept the values, you don’t need our money. That must be the principle. And thirdly, on the issue of our responsibility. This is the only Parliament, colleagues, which has no say about income: the only one worldwide which has nothing to say about revenue. That has to change, and that means Article 311 of the Treaty, once there is a change to the Treaty, will need to incorporate co-decision by the European Parliament on income. My plea to you – and it is more important for me than the period of five years or of seven years – is that, for once, we have can cohesion in this Parliament, unity in this Parliament, on our refusal ever to accept an MFF without co-decision by Parliament on the issue of revenue. That said, if we do not decide before the next election, it will not be the fault of this Parliament. I’m pretty sure that the European Council will not be capable of reaching agreement on the next MFF before the elections.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 44, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "  Mr Verhofstadt, thank you very much.

In relation to the multiannual financial framework, instead of discussing solidarity measures to address the refugee crisis, it was proposed to increase expenditure on the creation of Fortress Europe, by strengthening borders and patrols. Union leaders also agreed to increase investment in military industry rather than proposing measures to support the real economy, to promote funds and investments for social and regional cohesion, to combat poverty, employment and creation of new quality jobs. These policies which they promote will not benefit the people but will lead to new warfare and new waves of refugees. The current humanitarian crisis in Syria is, I think, typical. With regard to the European Union's relations with Turkey, the plea following President Tusk's informal Council to put an end to the violations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean is positive but not enough. Turkey has prevented a drilling rig of the European Italian company ENI from proceeding to a drilling in the Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone and continues to violate international law and Law of the Sea with illegal Navtex. It continues the flagrant violations of the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus. We therefore expect concrete solidarity from the European Union and more drastic measures, i.e. we expect pressure to be exerted on Turkey to stop illegal actions immediately, to respect the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus and to support the resumption of talks from the point that were left in the last talks in Crans-Montana, so that we can finally to lead us to the solution of the Cyprus problem.

Some Member States say they just want to have enough money for their national pet projects, they want money for their farmers, they want internal security and external security, a lot of things, but they also want to pay less money, and that simply cannot work because a strong and active European Union needs resources. That does not mean that we can just spend it how we want. We have to be careful with where we invest taxpayers’ money, and I can think of quite a few cases where we can save on some of them, from big pie—in—the—sky projects like ITER to the way we choose to travel ourselves, dear colleagues. There are also plenty of examples of how EU money is being misspent in the Member States, and there we need more control and more guidance before the damage is done. EU money always needs to be spent well and in the interests of the people living in Europe, and it must never, ever contribute to corruption. The fight between Member States about who should pay what shows that we need to put the EU’s budget on a more independent footing. Own resources should be introduced now and we think they should be done in a way that enables us to actually tax and take the money from what is destroying our very own habitat. The budget will always reflect what we value most. It is a tool to finance the vision that we have for this place where we all live, for the future, and we must put the money where we think the EU should be going. We should not forget either that we have actually agreed some important international commitments. I am thinking of the Paris Agreement and climate protection, sustainable development goals, to name just a few.  But money alone does not bring happiness. What we also need in the Union is a strengthened European debate and to bring decision-making closer to EU citizens, and that is where the whole discussion about the leading candidates comes in. Sure, that concept does not solve all the problems that we have, but it was – and it is – a vital step forward for a more accountable Commission and, more generally, a more accountable European Union. If Member States were to give up that progress because they were afraid that they themselves might not win or because they prefer to have some backroom deals, then this really is a slap in the face of European democracy, and whoever goes down that path should not be surprised if Europe herself gets up at some point and slaps back.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 47, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Gerard BATTEN", "mepid": "28497", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, this debate is of course taking place because you have to talk about how you are going to fill the shortfall of money left when Britain leaves the European Union.

In the referendum, the British people voted to leave the European Union, and what that means is that we don’t give any more money to the European Union.

There has been a crucial point in the Treaty of Lisbon, which we practiced last time in the election of the President of the Commission, but which has not yet been fully brought into the political debate by the political parties in the same way: that is the question of the top candidate. We would like the Treaty to proceed in the future — and we will not allow the European Council to defend its own interests in its backrooms. We would like to note that the head of the European administration will in future be elected by the electorate through the European Parliament, as provided for in the Treaty, and this is not a clearance between heads of government. If we do not bring this Europe to the citizens in the crucial positions, then this Europe will not have a chance in the long run.

But Europe also need to be ambitious on programmes which have proved to be a success, such as Erasmus, the programme for science and technology or the youth initiative. Most of all, we need to ensure strong means to provide social and territorial cohesion in Europe, because without that there is no unity among European citizens. This also means – because convergence is a central problem for us – that, when it comes to the eurozone, we need to include a fiscal capacity in the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. So how can we deliver on all this? Well, the answer is easy. We have to accept, once and for all, that we need new own resources to finance our common budget.

I need to react briefly to the many comments that were made on the issue of Brexit, especially because of the decision today by the Commission on the draft treaty.  It is fair to say, from my perspective, that Brexit is a decision taken by the British people that needs to be respected by all of us. The right is there of a Member State to decide to leave. At the same time, I shan’t hide the fact that this saddens me greatly, and I also do not want to hide the fact that if they change their minds and want to come back to the European Union, I think we would all welcome them warmly back into the European Union family. I insist on that, because I think there is not one person present in this august forum, including the people up there, who has never changed their minds in their lives. Everybody changes their minds sometimes, and I think that deserves just as much respect as when people decide that they want to go along one course. But I do think there is one responsibility nobody can shy away from, whatever your position is on Brexit, and that is to explain in great detail the consequences of Brexit. That is the reason why the Commission translated the decisions from December into concrete text on concrete issues, and we will be putting it before your Parliament very soon. I also think that those who championed Brexit and are very vocal about that have a responsibility to explain to their constituents why it is going to be such a tremendous success. It is just too easy to then invent a situation which makes it seem as though we were there to punish them. It is not our fault that things are not working out. It is not our fault that you said ‘we are shackled to a corpse’, but now the corpse seems to be doing much better than you are. That is our fault? That is because these Europeans are being so nasty to us. Stop it. Take responsibility for your own position. Explain to your voters what you want from Brexit and then face the consequences if everything you have promised doesn’t work out.

The CAP is 37% of the EU budget, but in the past it has been up to twice as large. Direct surcharges financed from it account for as much as 50% of farmers” income, which amounts to only half the income of other professional groups. Low income farmers are the cause of the lack of young farmers. The financial situation of farmers without the CAP would be disastrous. Let us remember that not only farmers, but all consumers benefit from the CAP, because food is cheaper and the purchase of means of production increases, which also improves the situation of machinery and chemical industries and trade.

As a first approach, it is normal that the positions have still been very differentiated, but as we approach a new electoral cycle within the European framework it is essential that the next steps are ambitious and mobilising. In an increasingly competitive global context, the European Union must make convergence the key word in all its strategies: internal convergence to harness synergies and full potential and external convergence with the highest standards of innovation and sustainability. Policies of competitiveness, cohesion, agriculture, migration, security and defence must be interconnected by a strong impetus for innovation and social inclusion.

The Commission’s concerns, raised in our three previous recommendations of July and December 2016 and July 2017, have not been addressed and you know what steps we took on 20 December 2017. On 21 December, the Polish President signed two new laws on the Supreme Court and on the National Council for the Judiciary into law, raising additional grave concerns about the consequences for the independence of the Polish judiciary. In a nutshell, within a period of only 2 years, 13 laws were adopted in Poland. Their cumulative effect is to limit the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. The entire structure of the justice system is affected, in particular, the Constitutional Tribunal, the Supreme Court, the ordinary courts and the National Council for the Judiciary. The executive and legislative powers can now interfere with the composition, the powers, the administration and the functioning of judicial authorities in a way that, in our view, undermines judicial independence and the separation of powers, and if you undermine judicial independence and the separation of powers, there is a clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law. These concerns are fully shared by a wide range of European and international organisations, including the European networks of the Presidents of the Constitutional Courts, the Supreme Courts and the highest administrative courts. A particularly informative read, including for the historical context, are the Council of Europe’s Venice Commission opinions of December 2017. In light of these developments, the Commission adopted on 20 December last year a reasoned proposal for the Council in accordance with Article 7(1) of the Treaty. Simultaneously, the Commission also adopted a fourth recommendation under its rule of law framework in which we invited the Polish authorities to solve the problems identified in that recommendation within three months. The Commission also decided to refer Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union for breaches of EU law by the Law on Ordinary Courts. The recommendation sets out clearly a list of steps that the Polish authorities can take in order to remedy the current situation. In particular, the Commission believes that the Polish authorities should address five key concerns, and they could do it as follows: first, by publishing and implementing the three unpublished 2016 judgments of the Constitutional Tribunal. Under the rule of law, no government should be able to decide which court rulings are published, especially if publishing is essential for these rulings to be valid.  Secondly, by restoring the independence and legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal, by ensuring that its judges, its President and its Vice-President are lawfully elected and appointed. The changes over the past two years have led to a complete re—composition of the Tribunal outside the normal constitutional process so that it is no longer able to provide effective constitutional review of laws.  They could also amend the law on the Supreme Court so as to not apply a lowered retirement age to the current Supreme Court judges or the current first president, thereby avoiding almost 40% of its current judges being forced into early retirement. That’s a third option that should be used. Also, the discretionary powers of the President of the Republic over those judges who wish to stay should be removed, as should the truly extraordinary – so—called extraordinary – appeal procedure that makes it possible to re—open and overturn judgments going back 20 years, not on grounds of new facts but on grounds of social justice. This is unheard of in any Member State of the European Union.  Fourthly, they should amend the law on the ordinary court so as to remove the new retirement regime for judges of ordinary courts, including the discretionary power of the Minister of Justice to prolong mandates of judges that wish to stay. Also, the arbitrary and unjustified decisions to dismiss court presidents should be remedied. Fifthly, they should amend the law on the National Council for the Judiciary to ensure that the mandates of current judges—members of that council are not prematurely terminated and that judges—members are elected by other judges and not by politicians. I am pleased to inform you that since January this year, since the new government has been in power, exchanges between the Commission and the Polish authorities have been taking place again. For the first time in two years, we really have a dialogue, and I think we should continue this at all levels. We met with the Prime Minister and with the Foreign Minister: Jean—Claude Juncker met with the Prime Minister and Věra Jourová met the Foreign Minister, so we are intensifying our contact.  I really hope that this dialogue will lead to concrete measures which address adequately these five key issues before the end of March because the dialogue, however pleasant and intensive, is only useful if it produces results. I’m really looking forward to Poland’s concrete reactions to our recommendation.  I cannot overstate the importance of the rule of law for the functioning of the European Union. Respect for the rule of law is not only a prerequisite for the protection of all the fundamental values listed in Article 2; it is also a prerequisite for upholding all rights and obligations deriving from the Treaties and for establishing mutual trust of citizens, businesses and national authorities in the legal systems of all other Member States. The proper functioning of the rule of law is also essential, in particular, for the seamless operation of the internal market and an investment—friendly environment.  Let me also draw your attention to the Court of Justice of the European Union’s ruling from yesterday in case C-46/16. The CJEU has clarified the scope of Article 2 and Article 19 in relation to the need to ensure at national level an independent and effective judiciary. We will examine this judgment very carefully as a basis of our dialogue with the Polish authorities.  I would like to underline that the Commission does not question the right of any Member State to reform its judicial system. It is up to Member States to define and reform their judicial system. However, whatever the model chosen or reform carried out, full judicial independence should be safeguarded in line with EU law and European standards. You cannot use the argument of needing to reform the judicial system to then introduce political oversight or political control by the executive or the legislative force of the judiciary, which should remain independent.  The discussion today and the whole process that we have been engaged in for two years is not against Poland, and I’m really quite saddened by the fact that, every time, this is presented as a one—man operation against Poland or the Polish nation. We have a very strong difference of opinion with this Polish Government, not with the Polish nation. The Commission is working for a union with Poland and for Poland within the Union. I’ve said this before in this Parliament: I cannot imagine a European Union without Poland. We need Poland and I think Poland also needs the European Union.  (Applause) The independence of Poland’s judicial system and its respect of the rule of law are essential cornerstones for a strong Poland in the European Union, for an independent Poland, a sovereign Poland. There is no contradiction between being a fully fledged, active member of the European Union and being a sovereign nation. It’s about time for people who sell this nonsense to be called out. To conclude, the Commission has always stressed that upholding the rule of law is a joint responsibility shared among all EU institutions. That is why I’m so glad your Parliament has taken the time to look at this so intensively again today. We are now in a new interinstitutional phase which reflects this joint responsibility. Yesterday the Commission got very vocal and very strong support from an overwhelming majority of Member States in the Council, and both parties – the Polish Government and the Commission – were urged to continue the dialogue and to come up with concrete solutions to the problem. We are game. The Commission wants that to happen and I trust that this Parliament will continue to show its strong determination to uphold the rule of law in all of our Member States, including Poland. That is in our collective interest.

But we cannot close our eyes to what is happening, not on our watch. We remain seriously concerned about what is going on in Poland, and I cannot but express our sincere regret regarding the lack of will on the side of the Polish Government to even engage in a real, constructive dialogue with the Commission, let alone contemplate the changes that are needed. We are here for the sixth time on this issue and we are here not because we want to be or because we want to somehow punish Poland.  We are here because someone must stand up for the people of Poland. We are here because the authorities in Poland have shown little sign of moving. Rather than work to improve the circumstances and start to rebuild the bridges they have burnt, the situation has deteriorated even further. We have seen countless heads and deputy heads of lower courts fired, often by means of a fax. We have seen the reform of the National Council for the Judiciary get underway in a manner that, even with so many Polish judges resisting, serves to undermine the independence of the judiciary. We have seen Poland regress. Democracy and the rule of law in Poland are being seriously threatened today, and this cannot continue. Polish people are looking to us to act, and act we must. The Polish Government is even going as far as attempting to control historical narratives as a means toward somehow bolstering its own nationalistic aims.  Europe simply cannot afford to close its eyes to what is happening and so tomorrow’s vote will mean that we fully support the Commission’s decision to trigger Article 7 for Poland. It did not need to come to this, but unfortunately the Polish Government left us with little choice. Our intention is to do everything in our means for Poland to come back to the heart of Europe. The Commission has always made it clear, as we have just heard, that it is willing and ready to talk, but we need concrete results from Poland. We need to see respect for Poland’s constitution and the independence of its courts. No one wants to push Poland away; we have been trying to do exactly the opposite. But being an EU Member State means respecting EU values, honouring your commitment to fundamental rights and understanding that an electoral majority does not give you a free hand to do as you please. It means respecting critical voices. If you are a member of the European Union, you cannot ignore what it stands for. That is why we will always stand up for the people of Poland, the land that gave Europe and the world the values of Saint John Paul II, the genius of Marie Skłodowska Curie, the music of Chopin, the courage of Lech Wałęsa and so much more. Polish heroes are European heroes, and we are one.  So I repeat (Applause), it is not only about Poland. We know that if the rule of law is allowed to collapse anywhere then it has failed everywhere. This is the very nature of our Union and we, as the European People’s Party, cannot allow it. We also know that there is a huge gap between the rights that we demand as EU citizens and the mechanisms that are available to ensure their protection. It is something that we must address. The situation that we see in Poland has again underlined the need for a concrete mechanism that would protect the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights across the European Union.  Our message to Poland is clear: do not turn your backs on Europe, do not drive a wedge where one does not exist. Let us all come back – as we have just heard – to the negotiating table, engage in active dialogue and act on the Commission’s recommendations so that the current situation can be remedied as soon as possible. I conclude with this message. We will not – we will never – turn our backs on the people of Poland.

In the meantime, we have observed a dramatic deterioration. Whereas the position of the European institutions did not alter and our concerns remained, the Polish Government continued its activities. Dialogue did not happen for months, whilst Vice-President Timmermans was constantly urging cooperation. There is now a new situation. The language has softened, but the substance remains.  As we all know, the triggering of the Article 7 procedure by the Commission was not something done lightly. The activation of Article 7 is a last resort. We know this and we know that action has been taken only because the situation is serious. The Polish people deserve a free and fair judicial system. No citizen should ever feel that their judges could be under political influence. No Polish person must ever doubt that they can receive a fair and free trial.  There are also other issues we have to address. Three months ago we passed a resolution criticising attacks on civil society organisations and the threat to the sexual and reproductive rights of women, and we are also concerned at the repression of some groups as retired public servants. But today we are focusing on the matter of the judiciary to make it clear that triggering Article 7 in the case of Poland is not directed against the people of Poland. It is a last signal and it is against the government which systematically neglects European concerns, concerns which are not developed by so-called Brussels bureaucrats. There is a clear foundation in the Treaties and an obligation. A government that does not accept this is telling lies to its people. You may win elections but you put the future at risk.

Dear ladies! The resolution is ridiculous, as is all this harassment of Poland for the past two years. The problem is that really a huge part of you have no idea at all what is going on in Poland, what is at stake, what these reforms rely on and why they are being carried out. Mr Timmermans has been dealing with Poland for a long time, yet information deficiencies are fundamental here. I'm going to try to outline a broader context without getting into the polemics, because I was already getting into the polemics. Please, state! When communism fell, a new justice system began to be built in Poland, it was considered best if legal corporations took control of this justice system. And they got the power they didn't have in any other European country. It's just that kind of power they didn't have that they got in Poland. It was strange enough that a small fraction of lawyers behaved fatally in the communist system and should have been sidelined. That didn't happen. The environment will purge itself, as one of the time said, from a very respectable lawyer, but the environment has not come clean. So far in the Supreme Court, we have judges who have threatened the democratic opposition in the communist era. This decision to give law corporations so much power was on the part of lawmakers at the time, all of us a terrible naivety. We imagined that these law corporations this is some walking justice, this is her embodiment, this is this woman blindfolded and holding weight, pure legal wits. Well, of course it turned out to be untrue. Communists were not removed, their successors appeared and so on, and so on — this whole system of clientelism: who disagreed was marginalized, who compromised the environment was over. Such an obvious example of this was that the presidents of the courts had the absolute power to appoint a judging panel, which often — of course not always, but very often, too often —meant that before the process began, it was already known how it would end. We had the highest number of judges and the greatest procedural chronic. Poland was one of the countries with the most lost cases before the European Tribunals. And all of this was due precisely to the ways of the judges functioning. It's hard to wonder that these corporations, having felt power, have fallen into hubris — everyone, as they have such unlimited power, is falling into hubris. They began to behave like party entities without disguising their party sympathies or antipathy, which was also reflected in the ways things were decided. The principle of judgmental independence, which reads: I obey only the law, has in practice been turned into a principle: I can do whatever I want, and who I don't like, I apologize for the phrase, let it fall on the tree. After all, there are known cases of referees on the phone, and the most appalled case is a journalistic provocation: a journalist called one of the judges and reported himself as an associate of then Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk, which made various promises from the new judge. Or another case: the former president of the Constitutional Court made a ruling in a composition that no law, nor constitution, nor any law, was or present — it was simply a social gathering of the president's friends — and later marveled that the government had not published that ruling. It's a scandal — he called out — after all, I'm allowed — the law is me. Well, please, you're pathologies, you can't tolerate it. The peak moment of this marque of law corporations and political parties was the leap on the Constitutional Court, which was intended to lead virtually to politically controlling the Court for many years forward. The leap made by the previous government — completely monstrous from the point of view of the rule of law and the view of law — in this House or the European Commission did not provoke any reaction. Whereas that we prevented this leap, put most of the state into moral outrage bordering on hysteria. I have already said repeatedly that this is why you did not get outraged, that it was colleagues, political bias. The principle of double standards is really the only rule that is consistently followed here. Please, state! What is happening in Poland is reform of the justice system, 25 years late at least, reform of a system that worked badly from the beginning because it was poorly conceived. So whoever says that there was a rule of law in Poland, and only later as the power changed, then the situation got worse, this one speaks untrue. It was fateful, and now there is an attempt to change this state of affairs, and none of the solutions are original, each of them in some scope occurs in some European country. Therefore, do not be surprised, dear you, that when Polish citizens listen to the debates about Poland here in this House, they hear the statements of my honourable colleagues of the first order, representatives of the Commission, they fall into a stupor. What you say is nothing to the reality in which Poles live. You're talking about some Poland that isn't there, you're talking about some government that doesn't exist. You are, by contrast, treated as those who defend the old regime, defend the ancien regime that everyone is sick of. And please take this to the news. This ancien regime won't come back because he's compromised, so it's not worth defending him because he's indefensible.

The ALDE Group very much welcomes the decision by the European Commission to trigger Article 7.1 in the case of Poland. Since the last time we discussed this, unfortunately, further worrying developments have taken place, like the controversial Holocaust law and the new initiatives on a full ban on abortion, and it escapes me how these measures are solving the problems that you have mentioned, Mr Legutko. We call on the Council to act swiftly as well because with every day that passes, democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights are damaged further. So, no further delays. This is about the moral authority of the European Union in the world. People are watching us and asking themselves, ‘will the EU rise in defence of its own values?’ The Commission has set the deadline of 28 March, but in the meantime I would like to know what the consequences are for police and justice cooperation if the Polish judiciary cannot be considered to be independent – Member State authorities must work together on the basis of the presumption of compliance and not the pretence of compliance.  All Member States have to be treated equally, and yes, we’re criticising Poland, but applying double standards undermines the credibility of the European community of values.

Viktor Orban, the man of the dirty anti-Semitic, anti-Soros, anti-Brussels and anti-migrants campaigns. I think the EPP has to choose where it stands.  Finally, it is high time for us to get a neutral objective mechanism for upholding the values of the European Union. This House put forward a legislative initiative in 2016.

It was the first country in our continent with a modern constitution that established an independent judiciary. Poland also has a long and proud tradition of civil movements for freedom and democracy, from the resistance against the German occupation to the Solidarność movement.  Unfortunately, the Polish Government does not seem to remember the proud traditions of Poland and it certainly does not seem to care about the future of the country. It is taking Poland away from the path of democracy and civil rights. It sees opposition and debate not as a sign of a living society, but as a threat. But Poland is much more than the Polish Government, and we as the European Parliament, as the European Union, need to support the judges who fight against their dismissal. We need to fight for the people protesting against the destruction of the last primary forest in Europe and we need to support the women fighting for their rights over their own bodies. Supporting them means keeping up the dialogue, supporting cross-border initiatives and taking a strict and strong line with the Government when it comes to rights and rules, for when their own government does not want to live up to the most basic standards what do people do? They turn to Europe.  That is why we support the Commission’s proposal to trigger Article 7, and if the Council does not do its job on Poland asap then it should expect a full investigation into the Polish case by Parliament, as we promised last November. And let us remember that the people of Europe expect us to stand up for the standards and rights that define us as Europeans. This is a great responsibility that we bear in relation not just to Poland, but to all citizens of the European Union.

These are challenging times for human rights all around the world. The space for civil society continues to shrink in several countries, and human rights defenders are too often a target of violence and intimidation. There is a growing belief that national laws can disregard universal human rights. The International Criminal Court and the very idea of international justice have too often been questioned and it is against this background that we Europeans have an even stronger duty to invest in the United Nations and in the protection of human rights through the UN system. This is why the European Union continues actively to engage in the UN human rights forums. Earlier this week, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted new conclusions on the political priorities for the European Union in the human rights forums in 2018. When human rights come under threat, we must mobilise all of our tools to protect the people in need and improve the situation. This means that our action on the ground, where the violations are happening, must always be backed by diplomatic action at all levels. That includes multilateral action within the United Nations system, particularly in dedicated forums such as the Human Rights Council and the General Assembly’s Third Committee. We want the UN Human Rights Council to be a strong and effective forum to protect and advance human rights worldwide. For that reason, we also support reforms that would make the Council as effective and as accountable as possible to the citizens of all of our countries. The Council’s ability to address country situations must be preserved and, at the same time, the Council must adapt to a more challenging global environment. A more effective UN system is a stronger UN system and, for this reason, we support the United Nations Secretary—General’s ambitious reform agenda.  During the ongoing session of the Human Rights Council, the EU will play a leadership role on the matter of country-specific and thematic initiatives. We remain deeply concerned about the continuing grave and systematic violations of human rights by North Korea. Together with Japan, the European Union will table an initiative to address the human rights situation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (DPRK). We will also present a resolution on the human rights situation in Myanmar. In light of the violence suffered by minorities in Myanmar, and particularly by the Rohingya people, we will propose to renew the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and we will confirm our support for the Independent International Fact—Finding Mission. The European Union, together with partners from all over the world, will also continue to build on its initiative on freedom of religion or belief and, together with the Group of Latin America and Caribbean Countries (GRULAC), on the rights of the child, focusing on the protection of children in all humanitarian situations. Just a few hours ago, this House discussed the situation in Eastern Ghouta in Syria. The suffering of Syrian children is a stark reminder of how crucial is our work to protect children in crisis. We will also continue to bring human rights in Syria to the attention of the Human Rights Council. The fight for accountability and against impunity is not just a matter of moral justice but is also essential to the perspective of national reconciliation. So we will keep on working to allow access for the commission of inquiry, ensure unhindered humanitarian access, call for the release of detainees, and demand the full application of humanitarian law by all sides.  It is sad that so many human rights violations are taking place in this very year, as we celebrate the 70th anniversary of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, but we should not lose sight of important good news coming from all around the world. Support and awareness of human rights is increasing throughout the global population and this is thanks to social media, to the use of major sports events, to the power of youth movements, to more responsible businesses and corporations, and to celebrities and influencers who use their voices to advocate. This also demonstrates that every person can contribute in a positive way and stand up for human rights.  Likewise, together with the EU Special Representative, Stavros Lambrinidis, we have been working on the good human rights stories, with a view to the upcoming General Assembly. This initiative aspires to promote a fresh, positive narrative on human rights in the world. Its central focus will be on promoting good human rights stories by identifying, sharing and showcasing the implementation of human-rights-based policies in all fields through positive examples. We believe this can be a powerful source of inspiration for people all over the world. In times when human rights defenders are under attack and human rights are too often violated, it is easy to fall into cynicism and despair. As we work to find practical solutions to protect people and their rights, we must also focus on all the progress we have achieved together and try to keep the hope alive.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 106, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Andrzej GRZYB", "mepid": "23785", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr President!

Many of the priorities of the report are up-to-date in the context of the agenda, which was adopted for the annual session of the Human Rights Council. First, we know that the death penalty continues to be applied. Death penalty sentences are carried out unfortunately more and more. Some countries that have a GSP+ agreement with the European Union on privileged cooperation, the death penalty has been reinstated too. Second, the right to peace and to live in peace. An example is Syria and other areas of conflict, where in particular you need to pay attention — and here I fully agree — to the suffering of children in conflict areas and the protection of children in conflict areas, not only from the immediate threat, but also the secondary risks that come with it. And finally freedom of religion and religion. It seems to me that our initiative to notify a resolution on freedom of religion and religion within the framework of the United Nations Human Rights Council should be fully supported here. The last case I would like to point out is business and human rights, which is corporate social responsibility.

There are many places in the world where both factors, together or separately, have hit the daily lives of millions of people, and Europe occupies a prominent place. Xenophobia has become an official policy in some countries, which make the defence of an alleged identity a resource for repression and exclusion of refugees and immigrants. Austerity and neoliberal policies are also a human rights issue: the consequences of the “austericidal” policies launched by most countries leave a devastating balance.

I would also like to thank the Secretariats of the ENVI Commission and the EPP Group, as well as my assistant, for their cooperation, and also the Commission services, which have always been ready to clarify any questions about this report. The aim is to amend Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 on spirits which is currently in force. This regulation is a very good regulation and it is not a matter of changing what works well, but it was necessary to amend it in order to bring it into line with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Existing legislation must be consistent with the new legal instruments introduced in the Treaty of Lisbon, and that is essentially what this revision is about. At the same time, the shadow rapporteurs and I myself consider it essential to maintain Parliament's prerogatives under the legislation in force. We have therefore introduced a number of amendments introducing delegated acts to protect Parliament's current rights. On the same subject, we have amended the proposal so that these delegated acts do not affect the essential elements of the Regulation and, moreover, we propose to limit these powers in time so that they may be extended for an equivalent period of five years. In its proposal, the Commission proposes to harmonise the procedures for the management of geographical indications in the spirit drinks sector with those already in force for foodstuffs in general and, to this end, makes a major amendment to Chapter III on geographical indications. This change was necessary, and Parliament understands and shares it, since it is necessary to harmonise the various applicable regimes, but at the same time, to accommodate specific issues in the spirit drinks sector. We have therefore introduced a number of amendments in this regard. Another essential amendment to the proposal is the deletion of Annex III, which is contained in Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 on geographical indications. Instead, the Commission's proposal introduces an electronic register in a manner similar to that laid down in protected designations of origin and geographical indications for wine and food. This electronic register is an innovative and easily accessible instrument. However, given the importance of the registration, we propose Parliament's participation in future amendments to it through delegated acts. Both Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 and this proposal do not establish the maximum sugar content when it comes to rounding the flavour. There are Member States which have national legislation for certain categories and set a ceiling, and others have nothing. Parliament considered it necessary to set a limit for each category, but always respecting the highest limit already existing in national legislation for each category. It is also important to emphasize, within the spirit drinks sector, the existence of traditional and centennial methods for their production and ageing, and it is necessary and fair to recognize and perpetuate them in legislation. In short, this is a fundamentally technical proposal and we have to stick to it. I am aware, however, that issues relating to health and consumer protection with regard to excessive consumption of alcohol concern us all, but this is not the right body in which we must deal with this problem. I am opposed to including in this Regulation those amendments which speak of indicating nutritional caloric content in the labelling of spirits, but This does not mean that it considers that alcoholic beverages should be exempt. What happens is, it's not the place to do it. The place is Regulation (EU) No 1169/2011 on nutrition labelling.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 1, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 124, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, on behalf of the Commission I’d like to express my appreciation to the Members of Parliament who have worked hard in recent months to examine and to improve the Commission proposal on the alignment of the spirit drinks regulation. In particular I wish to thank Ms Ayuso, as rapporteur, and the shadow rapporteurs for their work. The current Regulation (EC) No 110/2008 was the last CAP regulation still left to be aligned to the Lisbon Treaty. The spirit drinks sector is strategic for EU geographical indications (GIs) and is a top GI export category. It brings a significant value added to the EU agricultural sector. Given its importance and successful application, the Commission proposal did not seek to change the rules but merely to improve the legislative text and to simplify current lengthy and burdensome GI procedures in the spirit of simplification. The Commission notes that most of the amendments voted by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety Committee last month go in this direction and provide real improvements to the text. However we do regret the position of the Environment Committee in favour of withdrawing many of the empowerments that in the past years have allowed the Commission to maintain the current regulation in line with the actual needs of the market. In its proposal, the Commission has used these empowerments only when necessary to supplement provisions of the basic act and adopt uniform rules for implementation that are currently dealt with by means of Commission regulations or that may need to be tackled in the future.  The Commission has divided those empowerments into delegated and implementing acts. There is little margin of manoeuvre for the definition of these empowerments so therefore the Commission considers to have proposed an appropriate balance in compliance with the requirements of the Treaty.  I would point out that the empowerments currently provided for in the regulation that I’ve mentioned are wider than the empowerments proposed for the alignment, as those did not need to be framed by specific conditions for their implementation as is the case under the Lisbon Treaty. In particular, we need to maintain a sufficiently flexible framework to allow changes in spirit drink categories. If the structure is too rigid we will not be able to respond to the needs of the sector as the Commission has done by amending the Regulation annually since 2012, always upon request of Member States and always with the support of the sector. Furthermore, amendments to definitions and categories are already subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament and the Council. The Commission can amend them under the regulatory procedure with scrutiny which, however, no longer exists under the Lisbon Treaty.  Turning to the proposal to introduce the possibility of using ethyl alcohol from beer in the production of spirit drinks, the Commission acknowledges the issues at stake. Nonetheless, we would prefer not to open the door to the use of ethyl alcohol not obtained from agricultural products that are listed in Annex 1 to the Treaty, as is currently the case. In fact, we considered that spirit drinks, and alcoholic beverages in general, should continue to be produced on the basis of high-quality agricultural products to preserve their reputation worldwide.  Using a by-product of beer production to produce other alcoholic beverages may undermine the prestige of those products. As regards the chapter on geographical indications, we would prefer to maintain the current definition of spirit GI, which is in line with the TRIPS agreement – meaning that geographical indications are all indications identifying spirit drinks linked to a geographical area, and not only the indications which are already registered.  In addition we hope to conclude the validation of the established GI before the adoption of the new regulation. However, we should be allowed to continue that process in the new legal framework in cases where such an examination has not being concluded. Therefore we need to maintain a legal basis for that purpose.  We remain confident that these and other issues will be resolved smoothly during the forthcoming trilogue negotiations, given the collaborative spirit of all concerned in these institutions and in the common objective of reaching the most balanced and satisfactory result which allows for a modern framework for the growth of the spirit sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 125, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Nicola DANTI", "mepid": "124821", "text": " draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on International Trade. — (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, the spirit drinks sector, with EUR 10 billion in 2016, represents the '8% of European agri-food exports.

In fact, the system of the protection of geographical indications plays a huge role in the EU’s trade policy. Europe not only succeeds in obtaining protection for its quality labels on external markets, but also encourages third countries to set up equivalent systems, and this is a very important issue for us. I would also like to highlight the diversity of the products. It is impossible to have a one—size—fits—all approach.

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur Pilar Ayuso for her report, which is a very technical one. I myself would like to address two points here which are more political in nature, but which are particularly important to me: ethyl alcohol from beer and the possible 'made without added sugar'. Ethyl alcohol from beer does not differ in any way from ethyl alcohol from wine. But, despite this, beer alcohol is not allowed to be used for the production of spirits. This is due to a purely political decision taken in 1958, which means that spirits can only be produced from products of agricultural origin. Beer was not classified as such a product back then, 60 years ago — without any technical or even scientific background. I think that needs to be stopped, because, of course, beer is made from products of agricultural origin. There is a need to end unequal treatment here.

In addition, it was supposed to contain minor technical adjustments and replace the existing procedures for the management of geographical indications in the spirit drinks sector with new procedures modelled on the more exhaustive and well tested procedures for agricultural products and foodstuffs. Pilar Ayuso and her team have done great work on this legislation. It is not easy to satisfy all Member States, and the work is ongoing, as the Commissioner pointed out. Ireland was satisfied with Regulation 110/2008, and in general did not expect or see the need for a wide ranging discussion on, or reinterpretation of, the spirits regulation that this realignment exercise has turned into. There are a few issues that affect my own country of Ireland, and these would need to be discussed further, such as the system of aging or the issue of Article 8.5 and flavouring, among others. I hope that the trilogues will be able to sort these out to everybody’s satisfaction. Finally, in my country a few years ago there were only four distilleries; now there are 18.

Exactly how ethanol can be produced from the by-products of winemaking, from sugar beet, from corn and many other things. That's not the point. The point is that decades ago this small competitive advantage was created for the by-products of winemaking, that these products can be added to spirits, while the by-product from beer production, which, admittedly, has only appeared in recent years — since we have been in non-alcoholic beer — stop is a waste product and does not have this advantage. I think we should think carefully about whether, without any knowledge of what quantities we are talking about here and what is coming for us, we are now simply throwing it overboard, whether we should give this waste product — because it is a waste product in beer production at the end — and allow this additional refinement should be that it can be added to spirits.

Other issues were mentioned here this evening as well, one of which Ms Boylan and Ms Aguilera García mentioned, which was around nutrition labelling. I hope that, following the plenary vote, the Council will move quickly to adopt its mandate in order to allow us to start trialogues.

These cowardly and abject assassinations show us that in the European Union people are determined to radically question freedom of expression — one of the many civil liberties, one of the many fundamental rights we have. These assassinations show us how urgent it is to maintain the day before for fundamental rights, for the right of expression, for our freedom of all, for the freedom of those who investigate and reveal facts which, of course, are not pleasing to all but which must be revealed to the general public because they have the right to know. Mr President, in the preparation of this report, we have reached — and I welcome it — an almost ecumenical agreement in this House — at least between its reasonable and constructive parties. We managed to cover the entire land that was to be covered, with 44 major compromise amendments. However, we still focused on a few major themes. I had proposed two at the beginning: the rule of law and the phenomenon of migration, in all its variations and also in its interaction with the rule of law, because the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights are the basis of European integration. A democratic community is not built on bases other than the predictability of the State, the reason for its action, the absence of arbitrariness and the guarantee of the rights that citizens have acquired over the centuries. The Copenhagen criteria exist, but subsequently they no longer exist too much, we discussed them again this afternoon in this House in the context of the activation of Article 7 against the Poland. It is clear that we need instruments that will enable us in the future to achieve a European logic of governance in which we all agree on what is acceptable and what is not, what an election can serve and what it cannot be used for. It should not be used to fundamentally change the nature of a State. It must change policies, policies which must be able to change once again after the next election, without questioning the nature of the state between them. In order to achieve this European logic of governance, Parliament has already suggested, in a resolution adopted on 25 October 2016, the establishment of a European mechanism for democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights. We have asked the Commission to endorse the ideas contained in this report. I think I understood from Commissioner Timmermans a while ago that he wants to do this, and I think it is commendable. On the issue of migration, Mr President, we know that it will continue and that it is better for us to get used to designing accompanying policies instead of acting as if we are going to stop migration. Migration does not stop, they have never stopped over the course of history. We need to invent legal avenues for migration, including in the absence of conflicts. There is a need to improve the reception of migrants, especially minors and children, and there is a need to invest heavily in training, education and intercultural dialogue. I will pass on to you the other elements of the report, Mr President, firstly because my time is coming to an end, secondly because all this is recorded in writing.

Yes, I am a politician after several years. But to be serious, for this is a very serious topic that we are going to discuss here today. First of all, let me start my contribution by strongly condemning the shocking murder of two innocent young people, one of whom was a brave journalist. This is not only an attack on people, it is an attack on freedom of speech and on democracy and our values, and I strongly believe that the Slovak authorities, maybe in cooperation with the European agencies, Europol and Eurojust, will find and punish the perpetrators so that we can see that justice works and justice lives in Slovakia and in the European Union. Now let me come back to the report and start by thanking the rapporteur, Mr Engel, for drafting it. This is a very comprehensive report which touches upon a number of issues that are very relevant to the current context.  First, let me highlight the crucial importance of upholding EU values, including the rule of law and the rights enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I assure you that the Commission is using all the means at its disposal to promote and uphold the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights. This includes the application of the rule of law framework and the launching of infringement proceedings when needed, as well as triggering the mechanisms of Article 7 of the Treaty where  necessary. In line with its communication on the enforcement of EU law, the Commission has started to pursue a strategic approach with regard to infringement proceedings, in particular when respect for the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights is at stake. The Commission has initiated infringement proceedings to fight a key challenge, the segregation of Roma children in education, which is explicitly raised in the report. The Commission has mobilised and aligned its targeted and mainstreamed policy and funding instruments to promote inclusive reforms of public policies. On the rule of law, as announced in 2018 work programme, the Commission will, towards the end of this year, present an initiative to strengthen its enforcement within the EU.  Secondly, you have raised the issue of the shrinking space for civil society in Europe. Within the last month the Commission has strongly affirmed the importance it attaches to the existence of a vibrant and free civil society and to regular and transparent engagement with civil society. We are monitoring developments at national level and will not hesitate to act when measures are taken in violation of Member States’ obligations under the Treaties and the Charter of Fundamental Rights – just as we did in Hungary’s case in December 2017, when we initiated proceedings in the Court of Justice concerning the Hungarian law on foreign-funded NGOs. We are also considering how to further support and empower civil society actors to help them perform their role and build resilience, encompassing that subject within the broader discussion on the next multiannual financial framework.  Thirdly and finally, the report very much underlines the need to take action against racism, intolerance, disinformation and toxic narratives, which are shrinking the space for well-informed democratic discussions in the public sphere and polarising our societies. We could not agree more. The Commission is leading the work on countering the increasingly worrying phenomenon of illegal online hate speech. Just this morning we have adopted a recommendation on measures to effectively tackle illegal content online. In this proposal we strike the right balance between the need to take effective measures against illegal content and ensuring that we can address the special challenges of terrorism content without stifling innovation or the exploitation of business opportunities offered in the online world.  The recommendation recognises that the need for measures may vary depending on the types of illegal content and combines the need for effective notice and action procedures with strong safeguards on over-removal and caution in areas where contextualisation is needed to determine the illegality of content when automatised means of detection are used without human intervention. The particular needs and urgencies relate to tackling terrorist content.  The recommendation sends a strong signal to industry on our expectations and keeps up pressure through the possibility of regulatory action. We are continuing to work intensively with Member States and civil society to step up the implementation of EU law on the ground, combat racism and xenophobia and ensure that prompt investigation, prosecution and proportionate punishment become a reality in Member States.

The introduction of a new European administrative-policy mechanism will not solve anything. Secondly, the issue of migration and asylum is a very serious and complex problem.

Otherwise, we will come to the conclusion that we will begin to question the right of the Member States to decide who, and under what circumstances and conditions, can enter and reside in their own territory.

The same issues have come up every year without there having been any major improvement. For me, it's particularly sad to see how refugee situations have been handled. Here we see that those affected are women and children. It's a disgrace! We are to be ashamed that we do not have a policy of solidarity for refugees. It is also with sadness I see on the EU's equality policy. Many issues have been joyfully lifted over the years on the EU table, such as men's violence against women, but it is going far too slow.

This Parliament, as the representative of all European citizens, must be vigilant and uncompromising with those who disregard these rights or fail to protect them. Unfortunately, recent experience confirms the need for more effective mechanisms in monitoring and sanctioning the prevaricating states. In recent years, men and women fleeing war and oppression have arrived on our shores, refugees who, supported by international law, came in search of someone who protected them. Sadly, we weren't up to it either. We are currently living in a situation of discrimination and serious racism that European leaders admit but do not want to face. According to statistics, a large number of Europeans are broken down by their age, gender, colour, orientation or so many other reasons.

Fundamental rights in the EU belong to all citizens, not only to parts of the societies, and we have a duty to guarantee this in all Member States. We speak about equality in front of the law, and it applies to everybody.  The second principle. The European Commission is a very strong defender of the freedom of expression, and we show this very clearly in our activity and initiative in relation to online hate speech, where we work with the IT sector in a very careful way and where we always emphasise that freedom of expression is untouchable unless there are calls for violence, which are prohibited by criminal law in all the Member States.  So these are the principles which I wanted to remind you of in this place. The last comment concerns what I heard here in on Istanbul convention. I am convinced that we are not breaching the principle of subsidiarity. The convention has been signed by all Member States. Slovakia, if I’m not mistaken, signed the Istanbul Convention in 2011. Now we are in the process of ratification, and yes, I confirm here that I invest a lot in convincing the Member States to ratify this very useful piece of legislation.  Let me remind you of the horrifying statistics we have in the EU. Every third woman has experienced physical violence in the last five years, and I ask all of you how big this statistic must be to start acting at the legislative level? The Istanbul Convention is a very important legislative contribution to enable the Member States to investigate, prosecute and penalise the perpetrators of violence against women, and I want to emphasise that the convention can be an efficient instrument against such horrible phenomena as forced abortion, forced marriage and female genital mutilation, to mention some of the horrible forms of violence. However, it also addresses the traditional – and I use this word intentionally – forms of violence. Tradition is a very important element in our society, but there are things which we should get rid of, and I am very much convinced that it is violence against women which we have to combat and get rid of in our societies. All actors have a role to play to renew our commitment to fundamental rights, rule of law and democracy, be it at national, European or international level, and we are fully committed to play ours.

First of all, it must be increasingly recalled that women and children are at greater risk of becoming victims of trafficking, being exploited and experiencing sexual abuse, and child protection systems must be developed and strengthened to prevent violence against children, violence against children them, their disregard and exploitation. We strongly condemn the increased trafficking in human beings, whose executors must be responsible for their actions and stand before the court. Member States should also cooperate more closely and intensify the fight not only against organised crime, including trafficking and trafficking in human beings, but also against exploitation, forced labour, sexual exploitation and torture, while protecting victims. Secondly, we still do not solve the big problem of gender inequality, namely the pay gap between women and men, which amounts to more than 16%, which has a negative impact on women's pensions, which is 40% lower than men.

The European Union has consistently supported the work of the Tribunal. Human rights violations and war crimes – whether in the past or in the present – have to be addressed. The Tribunal carried out important work and contributed to ending a prevalent sense of impunity, hence contributing to peace as well as fostering reconciliation and strengthening the rule of law. The Tribunal also contributed to the development of international law and legal praxis. It built up an extensive jurisprudence in international criminal law. The EU commends these developments that will contribute to future work in the area of international justice. The EU has always underlined the need to address impunity and ensure accountability, as well as to fully cooperate with and support the work of the Tribunal. We condemn any attempt to minimise or deny war crimes and genocide. Over the years, the EU has been supporting the Tribunal in different ways, using various programmes and contracts. We have banned certain persons close to the fugitives from travelling to or through EU Member States’ territory, and we froze their assets. The aim is to communicate to those affected by the conflict not only the findings of the Tribunal but also the important concepts which underpin its work. These include the concept of individual criminal responsibility, the rule of law and respect for human rights. These principles are among the core tenets shared by all members of the European Union. The Council has reiterated the need to continue handling domestic war crimes cases without discrimination, as well as addressing impunity and ensuring accountability, including through meaningful regional cooperation, as well as full cooperation with and support for the work of the Tribunal. The EU also called upon the governments concerned to pursue with greater determination the proper conduct of domestic war crime trials. The EU has made clear that political leaders should avoid statements and measures that could call into question the importance of reconciliation, and on the need to serve justice through the prosecution of war crimes. Full cooperation with the Tribunal is also addressed in the context of the Stabilisation and Association Process and is an essential condition for membership for the countries of the former Yugoslavia. For example, when accession negotiations were opened with the first country from the former Yugoslavia – Croatia – full cooperation with the Tribunal was a key requirement. Full cooperation with the Tribunal is also an essential element of the Stabilisation and Association Agreement with Serbia and of its accession negotiations under Chapter 23 (Judiciary and fundamental rights). This remains a matter of concern which the European Union continues to raise with Serbia. More generally, cooperation with the Tribunal is a regular feature of the dialogue with Western Balkan partners. We are grateful to the European Parliament for the support provided during the years, especially in urging the Western Balkans’ partners to cooperate fully with the Tribunal in order to bring justice to the victims and their families, and in condemning the occasional promotion of regional intolerance and hate speech linked to the activities of the Tribunal. When the Tribunal closed down on 31 December 2017, it marked the completion of all its judicial work. The Tribunal concluded proceedings against all 161 of the individuals that were indicted for serious violations of international humanitarian law. The Tribunal’s successor – the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals – was established to perform a number of essential functions. This mechanism provides a further framework in which to address the reconciliation. The European Union fully respects the decisions of the Tribunal and reiterates the need for full cooperation with its successor mechanism. To conclude, let me express my sincere hope, as we look back to the last twenty years, to see the dark chapters of the Western Balkans’ history being finally put to rest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 185, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am taking this point on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Hahn, who unfortunately cannot be here. There has never been a more timely moment to address the subject of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, or the broader issues of the legacy of past, impunity and reconciliation in the Western Balkans. These issues are directly addressed in the strategy for the Western Balkans, which the Commission adopted on 6 February. It states that ‘the process of transitional justice is incomplete. The outstanding sensitive issues, such as the handling of war crime cases, including through full cooperation with the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals and the Kosovo Specialist Chambers, and the fate of missing persons, refugees and internally displaced persons, as well as the identification and removal of remaining landmines in the region, must be urgently addressed. The International Tribunal has been a mainstay in the process of bringing justice to the region. As United Nations Secretary—General António Guterres said at the closing ceremony of the Tribunal in December last year, ‘The Tribunal has pushed international expectations of accountability beyond what was anticipated in 1993, transforming how we speak about, and addressing, situations in which serious international crimes are committed.’ Commissioner Hahn has been in regular contact with both the President of the International Tribunal and the chief prosecutor. Both have made it clear that its achievements would not have been possible without the European Union, without our political engagement and without our financial support – some EUR 10 million in total – and without the leverage of our accession conditionality.  So today I confirm that the commitment of the Commission is as strong as ever, stronger indeed, as we must see that the closure of the Tribunal is not the end of the matter. The successor to the Tribunal, which is the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals, is now well established. In the strategy which the Commission adopted recently, we are explicit in our continued support. This applies in particular to regional cooperation. Without such regional cooperation, perpetrators will continue to walk free outside the jurisdiction of national courts, and the families of the 10 000 still missing will not have their loved ones identified. Our political support is essential, but so is our financial support. Up to EUR 1 million is available this year. Our conditionality remains an integral element in the accession negotiations. More than this, it has been refined to reflect our ‘fundamentals first’ approach to the accession negotiations, allowing more thorough and detailed work than ever before. This work is set in the broader context of promoting reconciliation. We will work towards a more integrated approach, bringing many existing strands together. Not only will this include the issues of war crimes, missing persons, and also landmines, but we will also look to education, youth and culture and the ongoing regional cooperation in many fields as vectors to support the reconciliation process.  However, as our strategy adopted today clearly spells out, ‘Regional cooperation, good neighbourly relations and reconciliation cannot be imposed from outside. The leaders of the region must take full ownership and lead by example. They must avoid and condemn any statements or actions which would fuel inter—ethnic tension, and actively counter nationalist narratives.’ There must be no place in the European Union for inflammatory rhetoric, let alone for glorification of war criminals from any side. I would like the Parliament to work closely with the Commission on both of these aspects, in supporting the actions which the Commission will undertake and also in being clear in the messages that we will need to put across if reconciliation is to become a reality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 186, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Dubravka ŠUICA", "mepid": "119434", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. — Mr. President, I regret that we have to go back to the past again because it is obvious that without clarifying the relationship and the truth about the past, it is difficult to build a future.

There is little to say that the court has completely failed in its mission. Spare from persecution of some of the main architects of the war from the top of the Yugoslav People's Army and former Yugoslavia intelligence services, shamefully low punishment for the slaughter at Ovcara and acquittal of the villainous Vojislav Seselja, the slowness that made Milosevic evade the hand of justice, and indictment to Ratko The young man had to be reduced, then politicization of the work of the prosecution — are just some of the reasons why the ICTY cannot get a passing grade at the end of the story.

There were groups present representing the families of victims, victims of every nationality and every ethnicity, men, women and children. All had their criticisms of the Tribunal and its work in specific cases, but all were in total agreement that without the Tribunal, without the support of the international community and without the support of the European Union, there would have been no justice at all.

We join you in stressing the importance of policies of reconciliation as part of the European integration process so that civilians of all ethnicities may overcome the tensions of the past and begin peaceful and genuine coexistence in the interests of sustainable peace, stability and economic growth.  The specific priority of the Bulgarian Presidency is the European perspective and connectivity in the Western Balkans, as the European perspective continues to be a major driving force for achieving stability in serious political and economic transformations. Emphasising the importance of the Tribunal in terms of building peace, fostering reconciliation and endorsing the rule of law, we encourage the respective governments involved in the Tribunal’s processes to cooperate fully with, and respect the decision of, its successor, the Mechanism for International Criminal Tribunals.  As one of our main priorities, we will continue to support concrete progress on each country’s EU path, on the basis of merit, focusing on further strengthening institutions, good governance and the rule of law, building and fostering good neighbourly relations and inclusive regional cooperation, mitigating stability risks and promoting social economic development and cohesion. The Tribunal has finished its existence, but there is still work to be done, so we encourage our Western Balkan partners to make further efforts to overcome legacies of the past and to foster reconciliation, including through promoting a climate of tolerance.

However, while these missions were essentially fulfilled, the political objective of this quarter-century judicial saga, which consisted of the reconciliation of the peoples of the Balkans, ended in failure. Indeed, the decisions of the Tribunal are too often, wrongly or rightly, passed in the eyes of the Serb people as the result of partisan victors' justice. Some spectacular acquittals, such as the current Kosovar Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, will remain engraved in their memoirs as a demonstration of this double standards.

Nevertheless, thank you very much for your kind invitation to participate in this very interesting, timely and important debate. I am glad to have a chance to discuss transparency practices in the EU institutions with you, to tell you about my rendezvous with my friend and former Commission President, Mr Barroso, and also to correct some unintentional – and also some intentional – misperceptions concerning the meetings. I did not think that the glass of beer I had with Mr Barroso would merit such attention, but I think it is good to clarify what this Commission does to meet the highest standards of transparency in general and, in particular, how we decided to deal with meetings with Mr Barroso after he accepted the position with Goldman Sachs. This Commission took a very clear commitment from the very beginning to be transparent vis-à-vis European citizens and its actions. It is very important for this Commission and very important for me. This is why I have always paid great attention to the transparency of my meetings, and you can consult this on my website. The European Commission as a whole is fully committed to enhancing transparency across all areas of its work. Upon taking office, the Juncker Commission decided first to limit meetings between Commissioners, their cabinets, the Commission Directors-General, to organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy and policy implementation who are registered in the transparency register. Secondly, and at the same time, the Commission took a specific decision in November 2014 obliging its members to publish these meetings. Unfortunately, the same level of transparency does not occur in all the EU institutions. The Commission is the most transparent institution in the EU. Now to the particular case of my meeting with Mr Barroso on 25 October 2017. When Mr Barroso accepted the position with Goldman Sachs, President Juncker decided, and announced, that he would be received in the Commission in the future as a representative of an organisation. This is why a meeting with Mr Barroso always needs to be registered, and this is exactly what I did. I told my cabinet to publish the meeting on my website, in the section dedicated to meetings with organisations and self-employed individuals engaged in EU policy-making and policy implementation. The Commission decision of November 2014 provides for the publication of the name of the organisation, not of the names of individual persons representing the organisation. This is why I published the meeting with Goldman Sachs. Some of you are interested in details of the meeting, so I am happy to clarify this. The meeting was set up at Mr Barroso’s request, in his personal capacity and not as a representative of the organisation. It was arranged over the phone by my office. I met him in the bar of the Silken Berlaymont hotel for a beer. Mr Barroso and I were the only persons present at this meeting. I consider José Manuel Barroso as a friend. I worked a lot with him when he was the President of the European Commission and I was the Finance Minister and Prime Minister of my country at the time. We worked together through one of the most difficult periods in Europe’s recent history, during the economic and financial crisis. For about four months I was Vice-President in this Commission in 2014, during his second mandate. In spring 2016, before he accepted a position with Goldman Sachs, I visited the United States. During my visit I spoke at the University of Princeton, where Mr Barroso was a lecturer and held a faculty, and he was kind enough to organise the event with the students to discuss Europe. Mr Barroso and I were also, at the same time, on a panel at the Atlantic Council event during my visit. When he proposed we have a cup of coffee, I suggested going for a beer instead. My office took care of setting up the time and place of the meeting. If he had not contacted me, I would have contacted him, because I had already been thinking for a long time that it would be nice to see him again. When we met it was me doing most of the talking. I told him about our ambitious trade and defence agenda. He is a lecturing professor, travelling a lot and meeting world leaders, so I thought it would be useful for him to know that Europe is on the move again. I hoped he would spread the word. I also spoke to him about the ‘Future of Europe’ discussion, which many of you are familiar with. Of course, we discussed politics, life and personal matters, as many people do when they are sitting with a friend. Our meeting respected in full the rules the Commission has adopted. The Commission has never said that Mr Barroso could not have meetings with members of the Commission and that members of the Commission would not be allowed to have meetings with him. The meeting took place in public, according to the rules and the commitment taken by President Juncker. Had I not made this meeting public, I could understand questions being asked, but do not criticise the Commission for having made the meeting public, because this is a request we are imposing on ourselves. We all have a right to have a private life and we all have a right to select our friends. I could not imagine myself politicising other people’s friendships. The NGOs which had questions have received answers from the European Commission, and those who still have questions will also get answers. It is in this spirit of transparency that I am discussing here with you today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 212, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Paulo RANGEL", "mepid": "96903", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (PT) Mr President, Mr Katainen, first of all, I would like to thank you for the clear, sober way, and I would say with respect to this House, as you explained this matter.

But it is precisely Vice-President Katainen, who is well aware that it is inappropriate, hardly recommended, to meet with Barroso, given the controversy caused by his appointment to that private bank after having held the post of President of the Commission.

First, I would like to answer Ms Gomes’s question regarding the defence and foreign policy-related issues which we discussed. I am sure you know most of them. I explained what we are planning to do with the Defence Industrial Fund, how we have established a preparatory action on defence research, and also the latest developments on Permanent Structured Cooperation on Security and Defence (PESCO), etc. On the trade agenda, I explained or listed all the countries with whom we are negotiating, and things like that. As I am in charge of these issues and am interested in these issues, it says a lot that things are now moving in a positive direction in Europe. Those MEPs who are involved in these files will know more or less the substance of what I discussed.  A couple of other remarks. I understand that people have controversial thoughts regarding Goldman Sachs as a financial institution. Everybody has the right to have a negative, positive or neutral position on this. Also, some people may have a certain attitude or opinion regarding Mr Barroso. I think we all can agree here that, as Mr Giegold said, transparency does not mean denying people the chance to meet each other. Commissioners are allowed – just like anyone else – to meet Mr Barroso, for instance. He cannot be the only person in the world who cannot be met. I am sure that many of you can understand that it is natural to meet and discuss with a person who I know from many years back and who I consider a friend, who has a wide view on how the world is moving, just like anyone else meets him. If I invited him to my home with my wife, as a group of other friends, I would not expect anyone to ask me to invite a Commission official to sit in the corner of my dining room and record what we are discussing. It is nothing more than a normal discussion. I checked my website today and I have never received anybody from Goldman Sachs. I would not have a problem meeting Goldman Sachs if they had something to say. A couple of my cabinet members have once or twice received representatives of Goldman Sachs, just like they meet all the other financial institutions, NGOs, labour unions or industrial organisations who are interested in meeting with us. Taking into account all the controversies around this topic, in my mind friendship also matters. I understand that everybody does not consider friendship in the same way that I do. It is not a matter which is relevant to public debate. Friendship has its own value, and I do hope that we all see things like that. I will meet Mr Barroso next time: I do not know when, but hopefully, soon enough. We see each other very rarely nowadays because he is travelling and I am busy, but hopefully I will have a chance to meet him again, and I will do exactly the same as I did this time. I will disclose this meeting, even if it is a private meeting, because we have a principle on this. I will do the same as I did this time. Mr Barroso has followed the Commission rules and his personal commitment. He has not lobbied the Commission. I do not know, but I am sure that all of you here always disclose every time you meet somebody and you make notes on these discussions. It is a good principle, because we need to do whatever it takes to strengthen the confidence of our citizens towards the political decision-makers. In this House it is very important, because you are the real decision makers, together with the Council. Thank you very much for this discussion.

Let me start by recalling the political process that led us to where we are now, as I believe this is very important. On 25 May 2016, the Council agreed on the establishment of an ‘EU list of third-country non-cooperative jurisdictions’, and to explore coordinated defensive measures at EU level. Since the start of the process we have therefore been talking about a European Union list of non-cooperative jurisdictions, not about a blacklist of tax havens, contrary to what some may say. The Council’s Code of Conduct Group on business taxation was entrusted with the task of preparing the necessary elements for our decision. In November 2016, the Council approved the process, geographical scope and screening criteria for this work. At the beginning of 2017, the Code of Conduct Group then wrote to all the jurisdictions concerned to start the dialogues, and constituted expert panels to screen the jurisdictions concerned against the criteria. These panels identified deficiencies in most jurisdictions. Some jurisdictions have chosen, up to now, not to cooperate with the European Union, which is why they remain listed in Annex I. Defensive measures are already being applied towards these jurisdictions. However, most of the jurisdictions chose to cooperate with the European Union and agreed, through commitment letters signed at a high political level, to take the necessary steps to address the concerns identified. This is illustrated by Annex II of the Council conclusions of 5 December, which contained 47 jurisdictions. This shows that the approach chosen by the Council has led to a constructive engagement with many jurisdictions around the world and that the initiative has so far been a success. The objective is not to name and shame, but to provoke effective changes through cooperation. The same process applied to the eight jurisdictions delisted on 23 January, but their commitment letters were not received in time to allow them to be included in Annex II at the 5 December Ecofin Council meeting. We take these commitments very seriously and we will closely monitor their implementation through the Code of Conduct Group. Regarding transparency (an issue on which I know that there is sometimes criticism), while the process can be diplomatically sensitive, appropriate transparency will nevertheless be ensured. As a follow-up to the Bulgarian Presidency’s publicly stated commitment to greater transparency, during the last Ecofin Council meeting, its current chair, Mr Goranov, sent a letter to the Chair of the Code of Conduct Group inviting her to request permission from the relevant jurisdictions to publish their commitment letters. The letter was discussed at the Code of Conduct meeting on 14 February and the Group approved the text of the letter to the jurisdictions requesting consent to publish their commitment letters. The letter was sent on 22 February 2018. Furthermore, the Council conclusions and their annexes are very explicit on substance and process.  We are also in the process of publishing the letters seeking commitments sent last autumn to jurisdictions. We have published on the Council website consolidated versions of Annexes I and II of the 5 December conclusions. A six-monthly report by the Code of Conduct Group on its activities concerning both Member States and third countries is also available. The next one will be in June this year. I am looking forward to listening to your views.

Three years ago, the idea of having a European list of tax havens was not a plausible one at all, and I’m sure you can recall the outcry when the Commission simply published a compilation of national lists. Parliament should also be very proud of the steps we have taken because they are also the result of the constant pressure that many of your Members exerted, particularly through the recommendations of the Special Committee on Tax Rulings (TAXE Committee) and the Committee on Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion (PANA Committee). This is pressure that you will continue to exert with the new TAXE 3 Committee, the terms of reference for which you will vote on tomorrow. Among its other objectives, this committee will evaluate the process that led to the establishment of the list and its impact. It is important at Parliament continues to follow this issue closely and I know that I don’t have to tell the honourable Members to do so. Parliament’s pressure is essential for our goal of promoting tax justice at international level. Clearly the adoption of the list has not put an end to the existence of tax havens and I want to give you some more detail about that. In the negotiations leading to the conclusion of the list, 47 jurisdictions made written commitments to reform their tax systems in order to avoid being blacklisted. Eight of the countries listed then quickly realised their interest in cooperating with the European Union and committed themselves to reforming their tax legislation. The publication of the list has triggered positive momentum. I note that some people disliked the speed with which these commitments were achieved and the shrinking of the list. However, the blacklist is not an end in itself. The so-called grey list is more important for the credibility of the process. This list includes 55 third countries. We want these countries and territories to comply with our expectations in terms of transparency and good fiscal governance. The grey list places these countries in a process whereby they are required to abolish the aspects of their tax systems that encourage fraud before the end of the year, or by 2019 for developing countries. If they do not do so, they will be included in the blacklist.  But the work is far from finished: our attention must now turn to the precise and uncompromising monitoring of the commitments undertaken by the third countries. We will have to continue to work hard with them to ensure that they change their legislation and meet the criteria to which they have committed. Transparency will help us to move on from words to action, and that is why my colleague Commissioner Moscovici has called for the scope of the commitments given to be made public, for NGOs, for citizens, for the media and, of course, for our national parliaments and the European Parliament to see for themselves. It is important that everybody can scrutinise the implementation of the commitments made. That is why the Commissioner asked the EU Finance Ministers at the ECOFIN Council on 23 January this year to publish the commitments made by the states on the grey list. These commitments are contained in letters signed by the authorities of these countries. The Member States are the drivers of this process and therefore the guarantors of its credibility and legitimacy. Transparency must play a crucial role here and Member States have undertaken to ask third countries for permission to publish these letters. We are confident that they will understand that it is in their interest to allow such transparency. Member States have recognised that the Commission should have a central role in the technical monitoring of these commitments. This is something that the Commission takes very seriously. Countries that have honoured their commitments will get off the grey list. Countries that have not complied with them will return to blacklist. The process must be clear, precise and transparent.  The legitimacy of this list also depends on the question of whether the threat of sanctions is posed. This is why Commissioner Moscovici has called for strong and credible sanctions to be agreed by Member States to target financial flows through blacklisted countries. The European Union will assume its responsibilities at its own level, especially when it comes to the use of European funds. The Commission will soon issue guidelines on the use of these funds. Finally, let me say a word about the absence of Member States on these lists. This is a criticism of the process that has been consistently made, particularly by Parliament, and there is a misunderstanding here. The purpose of drawing up a European list of tax havens was always to deal with external threats to Member States’ tax bases. The aim was to reflect in our relations with our non-EU partners all the ambitious reforms that have been adopted over the past three years to make the European tax system fairer. Member States were therefore never part of the evaluation process when drawing up these lists because they are already obliged to implement all of the provisions that have already been adopted by the European Union, in particular our proposals on the automatic exchange of information and the measures under the Anti-Tax-Avoidance Directive, to combat tax evasion. Of course, Member States are not perfect and tax-optimisation practices continue within the European Union. The abolition of these tax arrangements is a long-term task to which the Commission is fully committed. That is the whole point of the discussions and harmonisation of the tax base for businesses, which were relaunched by Commissioner Moscovici in October 2016.  At the same time, and for the first time, last November the Commission called, in its recommendation on the euro area, for Member States to adopt and implement measures aimed at combating aggressive tax planning. The Commission can assure you that it will do everything in its power to ensure that the commitments made by third countries are effective, and that the results of this list on the ground match our ambitions.

But what is far less normal about the scourge of European tax evasion is that the haemorrhage of tax revenues is at the very heart of the European Union. Exotic destinations are only at the end of the list: it is because Ireland, Luxembourg or the Netherlands allow multinationals to artificially concentrate their profits in them that these are then able to be exported to other tax havens. The responsibility of the European Commission is complete in this matter. Secondly, the list of third countries misses the main target: the United States. I am talking here about the fact that the United States remains opaque and has therefore become the best offshore financial place. Indeed, the United States is the only OECD country that has refused to commit to joint reporting and automatic exchange of information. However, with the departure of funds, notably from Switzerland, Panama and the British Virgin Islands, which have subscribed to the transparency commitments, approximately $1,500 billion of offshore tax evasion funds will be located in the United States, mainly in 3 states: Delaware, Nevada and South Dakota. The annual increase in these stocks would be around 15%. Unfortunately, the ENL Group does not hope, on this subject of tax havens, any effective action by the European Union.

So it does not take too much detective work to deduce that this one member was the UK, keen to protect some of its most notorious offshore tax havens. To end this politicisation of the blacklist we need an open process, which is why my Green Group has written to the Council Presidency demanding greater transparency and accountability on the process of blacklisting.

The European Union list is historic. For the first time it gives us the leverage to put pressure on third countries that are publicly recognised as tax havens.  55 countries have already committed themselves to reforming their tax systems. This is an unexpected result. Of course, we’re not naive either, as commitments have been made and they must be kept, and there is a need to monitor the tax reforms of the grey list countries. Once the letters of commitment are published, Parliament will also follow their implementation. The work of the new TAXE 3 Commission will be fundamental in this sense. As you know, it was the initiative of Commissioner Moscovici to invite Member States to publish the letters of commitment that allowed many jurisdictions not to be blacklisted for the time being. Currently, as I said, 55 jurisdictions are listed separately, since they promised to address the deficiencies identified within agreed timelines, and the Commissioner has asked for these promises to be made public. Commissioner Moscovici has also been clear that Europe must apply to itself the same requirements of transparency that it requests of third countries. The publication of commitments made is in everybody’s interest, including the Member States, including the third countries which show good faith. These guarantee the credibility of the list, and for civil society it will be very important for them to be able to see all of these particular issues that constitute what is not and what is on the list. To reiterate the point on the question of whether Member States should be on the list: this ignores the objective of the list. Member States have already adopted a large number of proposals to reform their tax systems, and other discussions are still ongoing. This list, on the other hand, is a tool of an external strategy aimed at promoting good fiscal governance in third countries, putting an end to tax dumping and creating a fairer international tax environment.

There are many, but I will try to organise them and focus your attention on three groups of questions: those related to Panama; those related to the criteria; and those related to the inclusion of EU Member States in the EU list. Concerning Panama, I would like to say that, like all other jurisdictions in Annex II of the Council Conclusions unanimously taken on 5 December last year, Panama made sufficient commitments at high political level to address the deficiencies identified by our experts, and this is a positive development. In any case, the delisting from Annex I does not mean that Panama is not monitored any more. It is simply not considered as non-cooperative any longer, but it continues to be under examination. At the end of this year, Ministers will discuss the results of the monitoring exercise for all countries concerned. Concerning the criteria, the criteria as well as the sanctions are available in the Council Conclusions from December last year. This is a public document, because we also put high emphasis on transparency, credibility and accountability. Concerning the monitoring of EU Member States, I have to say that the mandate for this exercise of the European Union list was to look at third countries, because Member States are already under permanent scrutiny as far as any harmful practices are concerned. Every six months, a report is made to the Ecofin Council by the Code of Conduct Group, and these reports cover both Member States and third countries. They are also publicly available on the Council’s website. To conclude, I would like to assure you that the Council will regularly update the European Union list of non-cooperative jurisdictions. This does not mean that it will be shorter in the future. Jurisdictions that do not meet their commitment by the agreed deadline – the end of 2018 or 2019 – will be listed. The criteria and the geographical scope are likely to be subject to updates. The next Ecofin Council on 13 March will also return to this issue.

On the one hand, the sector is an integral part of European agriculture, providing principal or ancillary income to more than 620,000 EU citizens. On the other hand, 84 percent of plant species and 76 per cent of European food production depend on pollination by bees. The economic value thus generated, estimated at EUR 14.2 billion per year in the EU, is significantly above the value of honey produced. Unfortunately, the importance of pollination is not sufficiently recognised in the EU and this service is taken for granted, while in the US, for example, EUR 2 billion per year is spent on artificial pollination. Therefore, the main message of my report is that beekeepers and bees should be at the heart of the EU's common agricultural policy. The EU agricultural policy of the future needs to raise the rank and funding of beekeeping to a higher level than the current one. The biggest problem is the expansion of counterfeit honey on the EU internal market. For this reason, the purchase price of honey has now halved the prices of 2014. This puts European beekeepers in a hopeless situation. Honey is the third most falsified product in the world, food, and we must fight it not only for the protection of EU beekeepers, but also for consumer protection and even public health reasons. According to the results of a study carried out by the Joint European Research Centre, 20% of the samples taken at the EU's external border posts at importers' sites were falsified honey. The fraudulent producers, mostly Chinese, are trying to cover up traces of honey-forgery by resin filtration of honey. Some honey-traders improve these syrups with high-quality European honey and sell fake honey using the label 'blend of EU and non-EU honey'. That is why, on behalf of the European Parliament, I call on the Member States and the Commission to ensure that the fraudster, especially to force certain Chinese honey producers and European honey traders to enforce the legislation. I have made a number of proposals in the report to achieve this. The cornerstone of the solution is to indicate, instead of the 'mixture of EU and non-EU honeyes', the exact country or countries in which proportion the honeycomes used in the final product come from, in the order in which the final product is used The proportion of honey contained in it looks like it. Secondly, some pesticides in many cases pose a risk to bee health. It is of particular importance that the European Parliament adopt a single, scientifically sound and firm position on this. In addition, there are serious problems with various animal diseases for beekeepers. The worst of these, the Varroa mite, has not been coped with today, since there are no drugs that could effectively destroy the parasite. I therefore call on the Commission to involve all interested pharmaceutical companies in its research and to create a common IT platform to share best solutions and medicines with stakeholders. Thirdly, EU support for beekeepers also needs to be reconsidered. While the EU's bee population grew by 48 percent between 2004 and 2016, the budget for the national apiculture programmes was only 12 percent, from 32 to 36 million euros per year. This is only 3 thousand of the budget of the CAP! Therefore, the EU budget for programmes should be increased by one and a half times the current amount. This would amount to EUR 54 million per year, still below 1% of the CAP budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 260, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, first of all I wish to thank the rapporteur, Mr Erdős, for his report on the apiculture sector, which clearly highlights the important issues that have been outlined in relation to the bee sector and which can certainly influence the discussions in the framework of the future common agricultural policy (CAP). The Commission shares the view of the European Parliament with regard to the importance of bees as pollinators for our environment and for agriculture, as well as the role that beekeeping could have in certain rural areas. It is precisely for this reason that the CAP currently contributes 50% of the funding of our national apicultural programmes, which are drawn down by Member States with a total EU budget of EUR 36 million per year. The report suggests that this level of support should be increased. Of course, everyone will want to increase their budget, but these are matters for discussion in the context of the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) and the CAP reform. The Commission is also developing an EU Pollinators Initiative to establish an integrated approach to tackle the decline of pollinators. The aim is to raise the political profile and increase the effectiveness of existing EU policies for pollinators. The main objective of the national apicultural programmes is to improve the conditions for the production and marketing of honey. Given the importance of bees, not just as honey producers but also as pollinators, the Commission supports them by other means as well. Under the first pillar of the CAP, 30% of the direct payments are linked to environment-friendly farming practices, while pillar II supports agri-environment climate measures which also contribute to improving the environment for bees. While the report suggests stronger Commission involvement in various research and education projects in the EU, we should also keep in mind the value of the national programmes, which are adapted to the needs of specific Member States. Nevertheless, the Commission is closely involved in research activities in relation to apiculture, including the EU pilot project on breeding and selection program for research in the resistance against the Varroa mite. This was recently initiated by Parliament, and work was done by the Joint Research Centre on methods for detection of honey adulteration. The Commission also established, and continues to cofinance, an EU reference laboratory for bee health, and it frequently liaises with the European Food Safety Authority for scientific advice on various areas such as pathogens or pesticides. The Commission is well aware of the concerns about adulteration of honey, in response to which the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) launched an EU-wide coordinated control plan on honey quality in 2015. The preliminary results indicate that adulteration, for example by adding sugar, is not only a problem with imported honey but also takes place within the European Union itself. The Commission is committed to ensuring that honey put on the market complies with EU standards and it is currently analysing how best to do this, although the Commission is not convinced that new rules on origin labelling for honey could solve the problem. The CAP also provides many possibilities for promoting honey. Member States can include in their national apicultural programmes measures such as market monitoring or enhancement of product quality, with a view to exploiting the potential of products on the market. In addition, the sector is eligible for most promotion topics in the internal market and in third countries, and honey can be promoted under the EU quality scheme, either because of a specific link to a certain region or because it is produced in a specific traditional manner. The EU School Fruit, Vegetables and Milk Scheme that applies from 1 August 2017 gives Member States the possibility of including honey in educational measures to be carried out in order to reconnect children with agriculture. The scheme aims to promote healthy eating habits and requires Member States to ensure the appropriate involvement of their national authorities responsible for health and nutrition in drawing up the list of products to be provided to schoolchildren. Several Member States, namely France, Italy, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Greece, Lithuania, Austria, Romania and Slovenia, include honey in these educational measures.  Mr Erdős’ report accurately reflects the importance of the beekeeping sector, and I have outlined some of the issues on which we can do more together. Perhaps many people are not aware of these particular measures which can be exploited to even better potential by Member States than they are now, through the apicultural programmes. I think it is clear that the sector is already well integrated into the CAP through these measures and it also benefits from targeted, as well as general, measures. I acknowledge that the report suggests we can do more and provide additional support, so we welcome the constructive suggestions from Parliament and I am sure they will provide food for thought, and honey, as the Commission prepares its legislative proposals for the CAP post-2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 1, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 261, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Mireille D'ORNANO", "mepid": "124750", "text": " draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. — (FR) Madam President, Commissioner, as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, I would like to thank Mr Erdős sincerely for his work, who is going to be in the right direction by calling on the Commission and the Member States to ban neonicotinoids. The problem is that this ban is conditional not only on laboratory tests, but also to field tests. However, the latter are considered to be too few, which has the effect of delaying a necessary comprehensive ban. This debate is strangely similar to the debate on glyphosate, for which we are promised a ban which is constantly postponed. Furthermore, the Commission considers, in its written reply of 1 September 2017, that neonicotinoids used in greenhouse crops are not dangerous for bees and therefore cannot be completely banned. However, these substances, even used in greenhouses, are persistent in soils and also in water. It is therefore a real danger when we know that these neonicotinoids will only disappear after several years.

Even today, a particularly awaited EFSA report confirms the perceived — and I quote — “high” risk for three neonicotinoids currently subject to restrictions on use in the European Union.

Given that 84% of plant species and 76% of food production in Europe depend on bee pollination, we have the exact size of the sector's importance, not just for agriculture, but for the whole world. In this context, I consider that the following objectives must be achieved. One: continuing the financial support of the sector and increasing its amount beyond 2020. Promoting and supporting the cultivation of honey plants that benefit from consistent support, just like protein plants. Effectively combating imports of honey from countries where the use of antibiotics is not regulated, as well as counterfeit honey. It is also necessary to intensify innovation and research activities in order to identify pesticides that ensure sustainable agriculture, but also to protect the beekeeping sector effectively. Finally, I believe that Member States must understand the need to support and encourage associative forms in the sector, so that beekeepers, through joint efforts, create their own production, packaging and sales capacities, but at the same time reduce the administrative burden associated with these activities.

Given the scientific evidence that clearly proves those substances are harmful to pollinators, I expect the Member States to vote for a complete ban of neonicotinoids during the upcoming meeting of the  PAFF Committee on 24 March this year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 275, "date": "2018-02-28.json", "name": "Daciana Octavia SÂRBU", "mepid": "33989", "text": "— Madam President, beekeeping is one of the most important sectors of agriculture, but unfortunately also one of the most neglected, both by national and European authorities.

It is also true to say that the importance of the sector is widely recognised and the value of the support already available under the CAP is appreciated. Everybody believes that we should do more, and perhaps we can do more. It is worth noting that the budget in 2014 was doubled over the previous programming period, so there is already a recognition in the 2014-2020 programmes of the increasing importance of honey in the agricultural industry. While I cannot pre-empt what is going to happen in the next budget, it is certainly safe to say that the Members here that have spoken will be keeping a close eye on the financial programmes for the post-2020 period. A number of Members expressed their concern at the use of neonicotinoids and referenced the updated risk assessments in relation to three particular neonicotinoids which EFSA has published today. Today’s conclusions will now be shared with the Commission and the Member States, and I am sure that my colleague who is the relevant Commissioner in this area, Commissioner Andriukaitis, will be taking note on, and a close interest in, this report. Today’s report does not make any reference in terms of a possible ban. The Commission and the Member States will now have to consider whether or not to introduce possible amendments to the current restrictions on the use of these pesticides. I noted what Mr Agnew said in relation to the banning of some of these neonicotinoids in respect of sugar beet, and I agree with his analysis. He has certainly indicated very clearly what I believe to be the case in relation to sugar beet and the possible exemptions in relation to the application of neonicotinoids in relation to sugar beet. I think it is also worth noting as well that this Parliament voted in very substantial numbers to approve a proposal from the Commission in relation to the banning in ecological focus areas of the use of pesticides, and this has made a major impact – a positive impact – in relation to the application of this new rule, in my view, in 2018 in terms of what will happen where more than 10% of the total arable area of the European Union will now have a ban on pesticides in these areas. I think this is a major step forward for which this House can be proud in terms of the vote that it expressed in 2017.

The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Zeid Raad al-Hussein, has slandered Prime Minister Viktor Orbán with xenophobia and racism.

A nationalist who violates rights, but a patriot defends rights. Viktor Orbán defends his own and the nations of Europe, so he is a good patriot and a good European. Politicians advocating the invasion of migrants, on the contrary, act at the expense of their own people and their citizens. Against the intensified anti-Hungarian opposition towards us, we minority Hungarians living abroad are defending our own people, for example in Ukraine, where on 4 February there was a nationalist terrorist attack on the headquarters of our Hungarian community in Uzhhorod.

Two young people — investigative journalist Ján Kuciak and his girlfriend Martina Kušnírová — were brutally executed in their own home. Ján Kuciak was a brave journalist who wasn't afraid to uncover the cases of organized crime, whose strings extend all the way to socialist politicians. In the latest unfinished article, he even pointed to the link between the Italian mafia and the Direction party at the head of the government. This heinous act is not enough just to condemn. I propose, together with my Czech colleague Luďk Niedermayer, that a new committee against financial crimes and tax fraud should also be addressed to cases of tax fraud on which the murdered Ján Kuciak worked. We best honor the memory of two brave people by contributing to the unraveling of the truth.

President Tusk, Juncker and Czech Prime Minister Babiš have spoken on this topic in the past few days. EP promotes the notion of top candidates who should be the ones relevant to proposing to office. For me, sometimes the EP pushes this issue in an irreconcilable way. The European Council enforces its right of nomination, which corresponds to the text of the Treaties in force In my opinion, the Treaty in force should be followed and the sane European Council should propose a candidate who can gain the trust of the EP with his Commission. The role of the Member States should be more fundamental. The President of the European Commission should just be elected on the basis of the choice of Member States.
