So I understand the frustration of Italy, Malta, Greece, Bulgaria or Spain, which too often the Dublin rule leaves alone to face the challenge of immigration. Obviously, we can't leave them alone. Having said that, it does not excuse what is happening and we think we need to put this item on the agenda.  We have tried to find a compromise. I understand that our Socialist colleagues, not wanting to dissociate themselves from the Maltese Prime Minister, would like us not to talk about the closure of ports, which I do not have a problem with, even if that is the trigger, then we could rephrase the title.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I have a loud voice, but I would still be grateful if the noise was a little smaller. (The President called for calm in the Chamber) Today, ten years after the start of the financial market crisis and five years after the adoption of EMIR, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, we are discussing proposals made by the Commission to adapt this important instrument to deal with the financial market crisis and mitigate risks to the needs and experience of recent years. EMIR has been in force since 2012. The last international agreement with the US under the Dodd-Frank Act entered into force on 17 February 2017, so we have similar equivalent rules here worldwide. The adjustment is due to experience, particularly with smaller market participants, with non-financial market participants, who naturally have a much lower risk than the major players in the market, and that is why we have simplified the reporting requirements. The Commission has proposed this, we have modified it somewhat. We have given the reporting obligations clear liability. We want to largely free up non-financial small counterparties, and we wanted to iron out inconsistencies in the first regulation. The competent Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs adopted the proposal on the basis of the negotiated compromises with the other groups by 46 votes to 5 with 4 abstentions. This is a very good basis for negotiating with the Council after Parliament's vote. At the same time, I would also like to thank three presidencies: the Estonian, which started discussing the proposal relatively early, the Bulgarian one, which has developed it further, and I hope that we will be able to complete the negotiations in a few rounds with the Austrian Presidency of the Council, thereby adopting a modern set of rules capable of significantly improving the risk reduction in the area of derivatives. As a reminder, in 2009, the nominal volume of global derivatives was USD 720 trillion; that was exactly twelve times the world's national product of all 7.5 billion people. The volume has fallen slightly, and above all the risk values have improved significantly. We have made rules and proposals that go beyond those of the Commission, which the committee approved. We have also discussed a really contentious point in Parliament, which we will also discuss further with the Council: this is the extension of the exemption from the clearing obligation for pension funds that use OTC derivatives to reduce investment risks. We have now extended the derogation four times so far, and the Commission has proposed another three years and, at the end of the day, two years. Bearing in mind that the volume of pension funds in the European Union is at least EUR 3.6 million, that is a huge stake. I am very grateful to the Commissioner, Vice-President Dombrovskis, for having set up a round table on this issue to hold the debate, a round table that will come up with proposals for solutions. And Parliament wants to extend these deadlines, at least not a permanent exception. That is why, Mr Dombrovskis, we are extremely grateful. I have read the minutes of the first round, and the stakeholders have also said there: yes, we believe that a solution is feasible. With this in mind, I would like to thank all those involved – the shadow rapporteurs, the Commission, the players in the market – for their good contributions.

Your vote tomorrow concerns the first of the two proposals we put forward on the European Market Infrastructure Regulation, or EMIR, in 2017. This proposal is about simplifying EMIR, reducing costs and burdens where possible without calling into question the core objectives of EMIR: financial stability, risk mitigation and transparency. The proposal is part of the Commission’s Regulatory Fitness and Performance programme. It emphasises the need for cost reduction and a simplification. The need to revise some of EMIR’s requirements became evident from the responses we got to the Commission’s general call for evidence on financial services legislation in 2016. Our proposal is technical but important. Its savings potential is big. The estimated cost reductions are up to EUR 6.9 billion in fixed or one-off costs, and up to EUR 2.6 billion in annual operational costs. Our proposal includes a more professional clearing obligation for non-financial firms: it exempts the smallest financial counterparties from the clearing obligation altogether; it introduces a new mechanism to suspend clearing in exceptional circumstances; it incentivises clearing and improves access to it; and it simplifies reporting requirements, in particular for businesses without compromising the quality of data. Companies, market participants, regulators and supervisors all agree on the need for this proposal and largely support it. I am very pleased that the debate and the vote takes place now as the adoption of the proposal is urgent. As Mr Langen outlined, pension funds currently benefit from an exemption from central clearing which expires very soon. Without legislative change this exemption cannot continue, but we still need this exemption for a limited time. While the market has progressed, it has not yet adopted viable solutions for pension funds to centrally clear their derivatives. In recent months the Commission has brought together all stakeholders to discuss progress towards a clearing solution for pension funds, and last week I hosted a high-level meeting with those stakeholders and I was happy that some of you joined us for this. I was glad to see that industry stakeholders all committed to design and implement a solution. We need a bit of time to put this commitment into practice, but let me be clear, we are not giving a carte blanche. Progress during this extended exemption period must be monitored, and the Commission will set up a monitoring group for this purpose. Finally, let me highlight again that the purpose of this proposal is to introduce some targeted amendments to simplify and to make EMIR requirements more proportionate. But these amendments need to uphold the fundamental objectives of EMIR. For example, when it comes to reducing requirements to report or exchange bilateral margins for derivatives: if we go too far, supervisors will no longer be able to supervise and monitor over-the-counter derivatives and mitigate systemic risks. We must keep in mind that this piece of legislation is one of the cornerstones of the new system we put in place after the crisis in agreement with the G20.

It is a very sensible approach and there is strong support in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) for this report. In particular, the rapporteur’s proposal to extend the intra-group exemption to a global basis and to introduce full, single-sided reporting for non-financial corporations is welcomed. This will significantly reduce costs for most small companies, which can then be reinvested in the real economy. When the Commission published their proposal last May, the idea was to eliminate disproportionate costs and burdens on small companies and to simplify rules without compromising financial stability. The Parliament has taken this approach and has stuck to the argument produced by the Commission. By applying single—sided reporting as opposed to the current dual-sided regime, it would bring Europe in line with other jurisdictions and make the EU more attractive destination for corporate treasury functions, which is an important aspect. Parliament’s position reduces the proposed three-plus—two—year exemption for pension funds to comply with the clearing obligations to two—plus—one—year exemption, with very small pension funds exempted. I understand the compromises that were reached on behalf of my colleague and his colleagues in ECON, but at the end of the day we do need to be careful about this. Whether European pension funds will be able to comply with the requirements over a very short period of time is a serious issue. I was the rapporteur for the IORP II Directive; I am aware that pension funds are fundamentally different to other financial entities when it comes to clearing, as they have a long—term investment profile and low liquidity needs. We really need to be sure that pension funds will be able to manage a new clearing obligation in such a short space of time, especially given the difficult position that many pension funds find themselves in right now with the low interest rate environment and the difficulty of making returns for existing members and beneficiaries. We have to find a solution to this; I like the idea of a round table.

It has been our priority, in working on this file, to safeguard financial stability and to expand central clearing, while allowing some simplification in areas where reduction of requirements has little influence on systemic risk and helps to reduce cost. A notable improvement is the introduction of a specific clearing threshold for financial counterparties. However, perhaps most notable in this report – and it has been mentioned by previous speakers – are the credible arrangements to bring pension funds into the scope of the clearing obligation somewhat sooner than was envisaged, against the backdrop of a number of extensions that have already taken place. Here I am particularly grateful to the Vice—President for having invited me, among others, to the round table that you organised with stakeholders – not least in view of the realism of the two-plus-one solution that we are envisaging.  So I am confident that it is absolutely possible to implement the necessary steps, especially for bigger pension funds, within the timeframes that we have put forward. Indeed, on 16 May a large majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) voted for those particular deadlines.

In particular, it is right that we are streamlining the reporting requirements by moving toward single-sided reporting. It is also positive that there will be exemptions for intra-group transactions and the removal of the backloading obligation. Furthermore, it is made clear in the EP report that data quality is more important than quantity. We must also must bear in mind the practical aspects of implementation of EMIR. Through the EMIR REFIT, we have been able to identify areas which can be further streamlined in the regulation. For example, an exemption for certain small financial counterparties from the clearing obligation, and it will now be possible for the Commission to suspend the clearing obligation in cases of instability in the markets. Finally, I am glad that the rapporteur has included a proposal to bridge the limbo period for pension funds. We must ensure that the pension funds are able to continue to make use of the exemption in the period between August of this year and the entry into force of the EMIR REFIT Regulation.

There is still progress to be made, and the first positive aspect of the text that we are going to adopt is that we insist that central clearing should go up; the share of the market that should be centrally cleared cannot go down, it has to go up. Second, this idea of having more conservative methods to decide whether small financial counterparties are below the clearing threshold is also welcome. On these pension funds: I remember the study carried out by the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) showing how badly pension funds were funded. When pension funds have to resort not only to derivatives, but to over-the-counter derivatives to run their business, then something is probably badly wrong. They made promises that they cannot possibly hold. I do not think that this is a reason to exclude them from the obligation of central clearing. The two—plus—one is welcome, and they cannot complain about that; they have to run their businesses in a sustainable way. We are going to vote on this report, but I would finish by saying this: Warren Buffett mentioned these derivatives as weapons of mass financial destruction. This was not by chance. These products are used in such volumes that they dwarf the real economy. 30 or 40 years ago, we had a working economy and we did not have this mass of derivatives. There are probably a lot of these derivatives that are unneeded and dangerous, and this is still a work in progress. Secondly, central clearing houses are becoming ‘too big to fail’ institution.

EMIR, the post-crisis framework for the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives, has its problems certainly, but it is a crucial instrument for ensuring financial stability. This review proposal bends over backwards in my view to meet the demands of the industry, an industry – let’s not forget – that just a decade ago brought our economies and societies to the brink of collapse. I share the concerns that this move reflects a more general effort by this House to roll back and unpick the financial regulations put in place after the crisis. The weakening of regulations may be targeted at the smaller market participants, but the nature of this market is that it is a chain of interdependencies that promotes risk volatility.

Even these modest changes will, by the Commission’s own estimates, save billions of pounds every year. But how many more billions could be saved by scrapping the attempt to micromanage the markets completely? The volume of data collected is so vast that there is no way to analyse it in a timely fashion, if at all. And what will the regulators do once the data tells them that the OTC horse has bolted? Close the stable door? All that will be achieved is to discover that a white elephant preceded the horse. And if proof were needed that the EU has not learnt the lesson of the euro crisis and wants to let sleeping dogs lie, look no further than the Italian banks, dramatically increasing their use of securitisation – the same financial engineering as in the American sub-prime bubble. Who can forget that? Certainly not those who lost their homes. Italian banks have been falling over themselves to bundle up packages of their non-performing loans, wrap them up as CDOs, and sell them to other banks at a pace almost twice that seen last year. 25 billion – I repeat, 25 billion – has been sold like this in the first half of 2018, with some senior tranches guaranteed by – guess who? – the Italian Government. This is simply making the debt contagious all over again: a wolf in sheep’s clothing. All it does is create a new debt death-loop between Italian banks and their government. Italy’s debt still stands at 132% of GDP, and over 150% of GDP if you include TARGET2 liabilities. Unable to devalue its currency, public debt is like a snake eating its own tail.

Yes, but it is right to reduce them where financial stability is not weakened, in order to prevent disproportionate lyant overheads, such as a double majority.

I believe that the outcome of the negotiations is balanced, it takes into account both passengers and all the components of the industry: carriers, manufacturers, workers, personnel, traffic management, administration. Rules are proposed to ensure air safety, but also to ensure the necessary flexibility in the production of aircraft and equipment, necessary in the context of the rapid progress of technologies. The Regulation covers for the first time all components of the industry, thereby simplifying the work of the administration and beneficiaries. The competences of the ESAA and the powers of the national authorities are made very clear. The development of certification specifications is based on the principle of risk assessment. DG MOVE is obliged to update all secondary legislation, thanks to this principle, within a period of five years. This principle will, for example, allow the rules to be adapted to different categories of aeroplanes according to complexity and utility and will allow the cross-border flight of small aeroplanes. Rules on security and, in particular, cybersecurity are introduced for the first time. A European warning mechanism for overflying conflict zones is also included. The freedom of decision of beneficiaries concerning the certification authority and, at the same time, the possibility of the transfer of responsibility shall be ensured if the activity of an authority endangers the safety of passengers. The Commission has a rather important future responsibility in the development of secondary legislation, which covers issues extremely important for passenger safety and industry development, rapid access to flight data for distressed flights, ensuring traffic control in the event of unforeseen disruptions, integration of unmanned aircraft into air traffic. This last point is extremely important. The drone industry is growing a lot lately. Rules are needed to ensure not only flight safety, but also privacy and security. It is obvious that, in the coming period, the large number of drones and the number of applications for these drones will create quite a lot of problems from this point of view, and there is a need for some very clear rules in this direction.  Parliament is still looking forward to this secondary legislation. I want to thank the shadow rapporteurs, the rapporteurs of the political groups, because we worked very well together.

Parliament has played a major role in these negotiations. Now it is for plenary to confirm the compromise text that has been reached with Council last December. This will contribute to our common strategic objective of achieving a deeper and fairer internal market while fostering innovation, with a strong positive impact on jobs and growth. A safe and competitive European aviation industry needs an effective and balanced legislation such as the one which you will vote on tomorrow. This new regulation is also a centrepiece of the Commission’s 2015 aviation strategy for Europe, ensuring safe, secure and environmentally-friendly aviation for EU citizens. It does so through a better use of resources, the enforcement of risk- and performance-based requirements, and by eliminating unnecessary administrative burdens. In practical terms, we are changing the certification process to be more tuned in for innovation, which means shortening time-to-market and keeping our industry more competitive. This regulation closes the existing gap in the regulatory system and introduces effective, cooperative safety management processes. Importantly, it includes a system of pooling and sharing of resources between the Member States and EASA and establishes better governance for our aviation agency. Allow me to underline other key benefits of the new regulation. It takes into account new technologies and market developments to ensure that they are efficiently integrated into the aviation system as well as subject to effective and proportionate oversights. This is in particular the case for the safe operation of drones, with new provisions regarding registration of drones and drones’ operations. I wish to thank again Parliament, and particularly Mr Marinescu, for the strong support on this important topic. It is worth pointing out that we are going to get, for the first time EU-wide, a regulatory framework for drones. This regulation also takes into account the interdependencies between aviation safety and aviation security. In the future, EASA will play a role in aviation security, including cybersecurity, and contribute upon request with its expertise to the implementation of rules in this area. Another very important point for Parliament was the establishment of an oversight support mechanism. This objective has been achieved. This new mechanism will represent an important instrument for a high and uniform aviation safety in Europe. Let me finally mention that the Commission has prepared a declaration concerning the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), as previously announced during the negotiations. The declaration should be attached to the plenary minutes and transmitted to the Council. With your positive vote tomorrow, the new EASA Regulation could enter into force in the second half of this year. The Commission is ready for this and has already started to prepare the implementation of this new regulation. Commission Statement (in writing) In the view of the Commission, services consisting of the emission of signals by satellites of core constellations of global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), such as the system established under the Galileo programme and other similar systems, are as such not to be considered as air traffic management and air navigation services (ATM/ANS) as defined in Article 3, read in conjunction with the corresponding recital, of new Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency and repealing Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council. This view is based, in particular, on the fact that those signals are not primarily or exclusively emitted for the purpose of air navigation, but are used for that purpose only through services that augment those signals, which are expressly covered by the definition of ATM/ANS.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 42, "date": "2018-06-11.json", "name": "Wim van de CAMP", "mepid": "96754", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the Commissioner for the introductory remarks. But I think a special word of thanks today suits my party colleague Marian Marinescu. This was a very tough dossier and he has brought several difficult discussions to a successful conclusion with the shadow rapporteurs. Aviation safety is one of the most important issues that the European Parliament can address here today. On 17 May, I myself, together with Mr Marinescu and other MEPs, visited EASA in Cologne. I am impressed by the agency's current approach and even more so of the tasks it will be given in the future. EASA also has a very good name internationally. After all, it is not just about the EU, but also about relations with the US, China and South America on aviation safety. I think that we in the European Parliament should be proud to have such an agency. Now there will be a task extension. It will no longer only be about aircraft and certification, but also about drones and soon also about the equipment at airports. These are all subjects that complete aviation safety. Interesting, of course, is the question: \"Will the UK stay or not?\". Of course, the UK cannot continue with aviation safety alone. So we will have to see how things develop.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which As Members of this House, they all probably fly much more frequently than the average EU citizen. But have you ever thought about how fit and healthy or rested the pilot and crew are? How many flying hours can the pilot have or whether he still has to pay for his training, whether he is tired or sick? The fact that we get on a plane more relaxed than ever has to do with the fact that it has never been as safe to fly as it is today. And nowhere is it safer than here in the EU. Therefore, it is worth looking behind the scenes from time to time and making it clear again and again that the level of security and service we enjoy is not a matter of course. In the aviation sector, with some delay, something that we know from other transport sectors, such as shipping and road transport, is increasingly gaining ground: profit-making at the expense of workers. In the long term, this always leads to poorer services and, we are convinced, this is not good for security. Because safety is a difficult and detailed work, not only in the technical field. Those who work in the field of aviation safety must be able to carry out their tasks free of entrepreneurial pressure, must be optimally trained and trained and, of course, receive all the important information. In order to counter the worrying trend of social dumping, we have enforced Article 76a of the new EASA Regulation. EASA will now have the opportunity to look at windy business structures in which no one can understand who is actually responsible from the point of view of clear accountability. The same applies to employment models, in which pilots are almost urged to fly permanently and to reduce costs on the devil's point. I am also convinced that we have set the right course for our aviation. We need more eASA's international presence to improve security worldwide.

Ladies and gentlemen, we are taking a decision here not only for the designers, producers and operators of aircraft, but for all European citizens. The summer holidays are just about. Many holidaymakers will soon be getting back on a plane to their favourite travel destination and they want to do so in a safe and comfortable way. Perhaps this summer others will purchase their first drone or a European entrepreneur will provide the next innovation in the sector. More and more people are getting involved in aviation and the figures show that as well. By 2035, 14.4 million passenger flights will be operated in Europe. That is 50% more than in 2012. We are also seeing this steep flight in the drone sector, which will create 100 000 jobs over the next 20 years. A good thing for the economy, employment and competitiveness of the European Union. But let us not lose sight of the safety of passengers and the impact on people and the environment. Today we are taking an important step in the right direction. We embrace promising innovations, but also provide the necessary security framework. Proportionality, less red tape and a sense of reality are central to this. In this way, we facilitate innovative ideas and save recreational aviation a lot of headaches. In addition, we also provide specific rules for drones. An essential step to integrate these unmanned aircraft safely into our airspace. As with other devices, manufacturers and operators will have to pay attention to the security, privacy and protection of personal data in the future.

Mr President, Europe is reaching yet another milestone to make flying even safer: with new European rules on the use and registration of drones, with new opportunities to use the specific knowledge of aviation inspectors across Europe, and with new tasks for the Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), to intervene when aviation safety is at stake. But new rules, new opportunities and new tasks call for cooperation between EASA and various authorities in the European Member States. For example, I am pleased that there will be a European system to warn European airlines about dangerous flight paths. Disasters such as those with flight MH17 may thus be prevented in the future. But that requires good cooperation between national intelligence services, aviation authorities, the European Commission and EASA. Intelligence agencies will collect and share information about risks when flying over conflict zones. Joint risk assessments are drawn up so that EASA can warn the European aviation sector of danger in a timely manner. Mr President, this calls for mutual trust and cooperation. This requires that paper rules be converted into workable solutions. I therefore call on the Member States to work together together and vigorously with EASA and the European Commission.

Mr President, thank you Commissioner and thank you to our rapporteur, Mr Marinescu. Sometimes it is not easy to find agreements, but we have done it. I must tell you that we have one of the most efficient airspaces in the world in terms of safety in Europe and it is thanks to EASA, it is thanks to the European harmonisation of civil aviation standards that we now have this unique European sky.  But aviation is a sector that is changing and needs to adapt. On the one hand, technological changes, with the mass arrival of drones. It is true that we, the Greens, had asked for a check of drones from 250 grams, a European registration and a driver's license for all users. We've had less, but the most dangerous categories of drones seem at least well framed.  We will still remain very vigilant about future delegated actions and feedback from THE U-space programme led by SESAR, to fully understand how drone air traffic can be managed in a way that is 100% safe and unsafe. On the other hand, the air force is undergoing social changes. This sector is highly exposed to precarious jobs in models such as low-cost or some regular companies. We have long denounced certain practices allowed in Europe, such as zero-hours contracts, pay-to-fly contracts or false independent status. Finally, the legislation makes the link between security and social conditions of air workers so that never again a tragedy like that of the Germanwings can never happen. Finally, we are also experiencing an acceleration in traffic: by 50% by 2030, x 3 by 2050, forecasts show an acceleration of the sector completely incompatible with climate agreements and this is where EASA has an added value, since it has environmental skills, for progress to be made in the lightening of materials, the use of hydrocarbons and the electrification of soils.

Before I conclude, allow me to make some comments on the topics that you raised. First, on social conditions, this topic has not been forgotten during negotiations. There are indeed new provisions in the regulation to make sure that interdependencies between social and safety aspects are adequately addressed by EASA. Let me also inform you that the Commission will continue to work on this during the year. In the second part of the year, we intend to issue reports on social issues in the aviation sector. On the question of oversight, let me say that the proposal includes a balanced and effective oversight support mechanism. This mechanism enhances the cooperative nature of the oversight system in Europe. It is driven by a clear timeline and planning of the activities and reserves the possibility to take further measures to ensure safety if necessary. I will make another comment on safety itself. Let me stress again that in Europe we have one of the highest – if not the highest – level of aviation safety, and it continues to improve year after year. This is clear evidence that the single European aviation market functions well and thus in no way compromises safety. On the contrary. I will make one quick comment on drones. EASA will ensure the safe coexistence of commercial aviation and drone activity for professional or recreational use. This implies, among others, an adequate design and use of our air space. The agency is already working on those issues, including in urban areas through the so—called urban aviation space or ‘U-Space’ as we normally call it. I have to say that this is a very important EU innovation. Before concluding, allow me to draw your attention to another crucial piece of legislation for the future of European aviation on which the European Parliament will be called upon to play a major role in the coming months, namely our proposal of safeguarding competition in air aviation, better known as the revision of Regulation 868. It is a priority to equip Europe with an efficient and credible instrument for the benefit of our industry, passengers and regions. Please bear in mind that the Council, under the Bulgarian Presidency, reached a general approach on this topic.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, this proposal for a regulation fills a serious gap: the lack, to date, of a system for monitoring, reporting and verifying data on carbon dioxide emissions and fuel consumption of heavy goods vehicles registered and placed on the European Union market. There is no common database containing all the monitoring data of the Member States. These data, at present, were neither certified, monitored nor communicated in an objective and comparable way, as is the case for cars and vans. This lack of information has led, first and foremost, to reduced competition between European heavy-duty vehicle manufacturers, with little incentive for innovation and the implementation of energy-efficient technologies. It has also made it impossible for transport operators, which are mainly small and medium-sized enterprises, over 500 000, to choose the most fuel-efficient vehicles and thus save on fuel costs, costs which account for a third of operating costs.  In addition, this lack of information has been a brake on action at national EU level to reduce emissions from heavy goods vehicles, bearing in mind that 25 % of co2 emissions from the road transport sector come from lorries, buses and coaches, which are responsible for 5 % of total emissions. However, a percentage that will increase, in the absence of intervention, to an estimated 10 %, thus doubling even to 2030.  Thanks to this regulation, data on carbon dioxide emissions and consumption of all categories of new production heavy goods vehicles will be available on the Website of the European Environment Agency over two years. The European Commission's proposal was already a good starting point and the work of discussion with our colleagues in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety and with the Bulgarian Presidency of the Council and the Commission itself has enabled us to reach an even more ambitious compromise.  In particular, we have improved the quantity and quality of information that will be made public, increasing transparency, for example with regard to engine performance. The only exceptions will be cases justified by the need to protect sensitive private data and ensure fair competition between manufacturers. We then included with the mandatory checks, the provision for the relevant administrative sanctions, a provision that was absent from the Commission's proposal.  Another of the key points that we have insisted on as a Parliament is the inclusion of the result of roadside testing in the annual publication of data to compare vector data measured in the laboratory with emissions under real driving conditions. Mandatory co2 emission standards can now be set, which already exist for cars and vans, including for all heavy goods vehicles. I hope that this will take place in a not too long time, on the basis of the proposal for a regulation already dismissed by the Commission. Thanks to this regulation, we will have cleaner air in our cities and our mayors will have green buses available for school transport.  Europe is a movement. Europe is moving towards a more competitive and low-carbon economy than the current situation in which the transport sector is still 94 % dependent on oil. Today we are taking another step in the direction of a new alliance between industry and the environment, an alliance capable of creating new and good jobs.

This is the first piece of legislation on CO2 emissions from lorries, buses and coaches. A swift agreement on this Regulation has been possible, thanks to the constructive efforts and spirit of compromise of the negotiators from both institutions. The agreement strikes a good balance between the need for transparency and the need to protect commercially-sensitive data, ensuring a robust and reliable monitoring and reporting system. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zoffoli, and his team and congratulate them on the quick result. This regulation is a crucial instrument to close the current knowledge gap on the CO2 emissions and fuel consumption from heavy-duty vehicles put on the European Union market. The information made available with the publication of the reported data will be especially important for transport operators. In addition, the regulation paves the way for the CO2 emissions standards for lorries proposed by the Commission last month, which will need to rely on the data reported for its compliance processes. The support and steering of the rapporteur, Mr Zoffoli, as well as the active engagement of all shadow rapporteurs really paved the way to this good result. The European Parliament has strongly contributed to the final shape of the legal text. I would like to offer you two major examples: the introduction of administrative fines if manufacturers do not report the data or if the data reported deviates from their type-approval values, and the extension of the monitoring system to the results of future on-road verification tests.

Many thanks to Mr Zoffoli and all the others who have helped to reach this conclusion! For our group, this was Christofer Fjellner, who is unfortunately apologetic today. Ladies and gentlemen, we now agree. That was not the case during the vote in committee and also at first reading in plenary. The Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats was dissatisfied because the rules did not take sufficient account of the protection of intellectual property. After the mandate of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Public Health ,the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and The Environment, Public Health and Social Affairs committee, we were concerned that the data would then come into the hands of other manufacturers and that these other producers outside Europe, for example in China, would benefit from it. That cannot be the point of European legislation that we support competition in China and elsewhere. Fortunately, this was then amended by the Council in the trialogue, and that is why we can vote in favour. The goal is important. In order to implement the Paris agreement on climate change, we must use all our potential. These are available not only for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, but also for heavy-duty vehicles. For example, in the debate on legislation – specifically in the Dalli report and the other reports – we will see that the 40% target is already quite ambitious when it comes to implementation. That is why we need to think carefully and see how we get there. In all these questions, it is important for us not to reduce them in a general way, but also to see what is transported. Miriam Dalli has already presented her draft report for light commercial vehicles and passenger cars. A similar criterion is applied, irrespective of the size of a car and what is transported with it; the weight criterion shall be deleted without replacement. However, it cannot be the case that if you transport a family of six people, you have the same reduction targets as if you only drive a two-seater.

Mr President! Thank you very much to Rapporteur Zoffoli for an excellent report and a very good result. So why is this a good result? Yes, I think most of us have tried to take a ride on motorways in the European Union, and there we see one lorry after another driving on the roads. There are simply so many trucks, and that is thus good for our trade, but it is not very good for the climate if our trucks and other heavy vehicles keep emitting as much CO2 as they do. About a quarter of all CO2 coming from the transport sector comes from trucks and other heavy vehicles. We need to get something done about that. The legislation on which we are about to vote is precisely a step in the right direction. This is the first legislation that will help us to monitor and report the CO2 emissions of lorries and other heavy-duty vehicles. This is absolutely essential if we are to be able to see what it looks like and to create a competitive situation in the EU's internal market. We need those who produce the trucks to make them more environmentally friendly, and one of the ways we can do that is to make sure that we know how much they emit and how much fuel they use. We in the Socialist Group do not believe that this is enough, but that we must move on. However, this legislation is, after all, a step in the right direction, so we warmly welcome the fact that we now have legislation that will enable us to do this. That is also the lesson of dieselgate: we know that more transparency is needed in this data. If we have that transparency in the data, then we also know that we can put pressure on for development so that we can have cleaner and better vehicles.  We are also very pleased that the European Commission has succeeded in providing tools so that they can issue fines if producers are not given the information they are required to provide. Again, because we know it's so important - this transparency in our data is a crucial tool to ensure that we have a more climate-friendly transport sector. Finally, it is also important to thank you for the fact that we will now also have the opportunity to carry out roadside tests. We know that it is not enough to test our heavy vehicles in the laboratories. They also need to be tested on the roads so we know if they are complying with the rules we are given. So thank you so much to Zoffoli for a very good result, and this is a step in the right direction to make the European Union more environmentally friendly and to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 69, "date": "2018-06-11.json", "name": "Bolesław G.

The ECR Group considers that an appropriate certification and monitoring system should be established and appropriately high standards for heavy road vehicles should be introduced. It is important for the Regulation to specify the various points that oblige manufacturers to monitor and consistently report certain information, so-called monitoring parameters (I would remind you that in more than 70 areas this data is not yet harmonised). We need to take into account very detailed technical parameters regarding gearbox, engine power or, finally, fuel consumption. Such a detailed approach is necessary for close cooperation with the various international organisations in order to contribute effectively to the monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions from heavy road vehicles and then to be able to draw appropriate conclusions and consequences. The ECR Group considers that the proposed regulation is very closely linked to the rules of transparency, but also to access to information. I would remind you that, in our opinion, the information should be public and, I do not hide, also public.

There have been many oddities in European car policy. You don't measure the real exhaust or allow you to fiddle a little with the equipment. One of the oddities is the question we are now talking about: for lorries, heavy transport, there have been no rules at all.  When this discussion began, it was assumed that Parliament's call for a more environmentally friendly policy was really just a way of preventing the car industry's advance. In the meantime, the car industry has learned – it took quite an unnecessary amount of time – that by opposing the regulation of the various car sectors, it actually put itself in a very difficult situation, that is, it was technologically lagging behind and handed over a large part of the initiative to competitors.  Now we are at our best in the final phase of our work to achieve the practical rules for what this should look like for passenger cars. The next step in this direction, on the basis of the proposals we have received from the Commission, will be to take care of heavy transport as well. It will be particularly interesting because we know that the way in which we are going to share the burden between, for example, agriculture and heavy transport can present agriculture with serious challenges. Agricultural productivity is, of course, much lower if we do not take care of heavy transport taking its share of the Paris requirements, through COP21. In that case, we are putting agriculture at the same time in a worse situation. So we have taken a major step forward.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, if you count on European roads, there are only 5% of trucks among all vehicles in circulation. Yet these trucks produce about 25%, or a quarter, of the greenhouse gas emissions from road transport in the European Union. It is high time that we put an end to this imbalance if we are to one day respect the commitments of COP 21 to save the climate and the planet, but also so that citizens can breathe. Putting in place monitoring OF CO2 emissions and truck fuel consumption is good news. Until recently, CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of HGVs were neither reported nor monitored objectively and comparablely in the European Union. From now on, transport operators will be able to choose the least consumer and emitting vehicles: this will allow them to spend less and pollute less. Let's not stop there, the road freight sector must do more and better to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. The step we are taking today, of course, is necessary, but above all it must serve as a basis for the near future, that is to say to establish mandatory CO2 emission limits for all trucks in the European Union.

Mr President, it is on the basis of the observation that 38% of greenhouse gas emissions come from road transport that the Commission presented in 2017 a system for monitoring and reporting data on CO2 emissions from new heavy-duty vehicles. In doing so, the Commission risks being inconsistent.  Indeed, in parallel with this desire to reduce CO2 emissions which led France to promote the diesel engine, which allows it to display CO2 emissions more than 10% lower than the European average, the Commission has embarked on the hunt for diesel in favour of petrol. However, it is clear that petrol engines, consuming more than diesel engines, ultimately emit 25% more CO2 than diesel engines. So it's a vicious circle and builders don't know what to expect. On the one hand, the hunt for CO2, on the other, the hunt for diesel. Once again, it will be a punitive ecology, with administrative fines that will go directly into Europe's pockets, which will hit the heavy goods industry at the expense of a policy encouraging good practices in eco-driving and supporting manufacturers and equipment manufacturers towards economically viable environmental objectives. The Commission's proposal is all the more unreasonable because it does not take into account the reality of the truck manufacturing and use process at all. Indeed, the manufacturers manufacture bare chassis which are then intended for different types of transport depending on the car under the trailer chosen for final use. The manufacturer's data thus becomes unusable and de facto useless factory data, but which will actually increase the bill of the finished product. So the only option that manufacturers currently have is to turn to alternative fuels that emit less CO2, such as LNG or electricity. This is already what many manufacturers are doing; but the technocrats behind this text simply forget that these different types of fuel, if adapted to certain short journeys, are - to date and for some time yet - relatively unusable on long-term journeys. In this context, it would be more in the Commission's interest to encourage the development of charging points and distribution of alternative fuels before coming to tackle manufacturers who are content to meet a demand of a specific type of vehicle and corresponding to the current needs and possibilities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 75, "date": "2018-06-11.json", "name": "Wim van de CAMP", "mepid": "96754", "text": "   Mr President, thank you very much.

We know that 5% of all greenhouse gas emissions in Europe come from the commercial vehicle sector, and that is why it cannot be explained to anyone – not to the citizens, but not to the companies that buy trucks – that CO2 emissions have not yet been monitored and have not yet been certified. It is therefore time, and it is right – and that is why I would also like to thank my colleague Mr Damiano for conducting these negotiations so well – that we finally have a proposal on the table that will ensure that we have transparency in this very important area. It is good that we have negotiated sanctions in this paper, so that we can also make manufacturers who do not comply with the transparency obligations responsible, sanction them, because we are all working every day to reduce CO2 emissions, and the manufacturers of heavy goods vehicles must do the same. It is also important that we give truck buyers the opportunity to base their purchasing decisions on how much CO2 a truck emits. We are still seeing an increase in lorry traffic within the European Union, while freight traffic by rail is decreasing, even though rail transport would be much more climate-friendly. In this respect, this proposal is also an approach to create more transparency and more market justice and to get more goods from road to rail.

Stricter rules and reviews are needed, not only because of limited trust, but also so that we can review how our decisions work in practice.

I believe wholeheartedly that the majority of this House and of Europe share the same objective. The environmental impact is to be reduced, the sector should contribute to climate protection, and we should get away from oil, also for geopolitical reasons. Synthetic fuels not only protect the environment, but also reduce our dependence and bring the value chain back to Europe. The batteries do not solve this problem, but actually create new ones.

CO2 emissions and fuel consumption of new heavy goods vehicles placed in the European Union are not, as we all know, subject to certification, surveillance or data communication, as is already the case with passenger and commercial light vehicles.

I would therefore call for the Commission, in parallel to such projects, to also provide for measures to support science, research and development towards the creation of new technical and technological solutions that will facilitate the achievement of these objectives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 83, "date": "2018-06-11.json", "name": "Isabella DE MONTE", "mepid": "124803", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I should like to begin by thanking my colleague Damiano Zoffoli, for the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, and my colleague Nicola Caputo, for the Committee on Transport and Tourism, for their work on this important dossier. The transport sector contributes significantly to total emissions in the European Union and heavy goods vehicles play a predominant role. Europe's targets for reducing emissions are ambitious, and I believe that these will be difficult to achieve if we are not able to monitor and compare data on heavy goods vehicles, as we already do for cars and light vehicles.  If we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in road transport by 60 % by 2050, we must also have a system for monitoring emissions and consumption for heavy goods vehicles. Moreover, this is proposed by the European 2016 strategy for low-emission mobility. Finally, it will therefore be possible to have reliable data on both fuel consumption and emissions for these vehicles too. After the Dieselgate scandal, in fact, it is increasingly necessary to collect and disseminate data on real driving emissions, and not those calculated in the laboratory. The data collected will be managed in a database by the Environment Agency, but never before am I convinced that there is also a need for a road transport agency, which could not only ensure that this information is accessible to the public, but also that sensitive and commercial data is protected.

I am pleased to support this proposal, which looks to put in place an EU-wide system for monitoring and reporting of CO2 emissions and fuel consumption for manufacturers’ heavy-duty vehicles, or HGVs. As part of this mandatory system, the findings would be cross-checked against new vehicle registration data as provided by Member States. At present, HGVs account for approximately a quarter of the EU’s CO2 emissions from road transport – a very high sum. It is anticipated that this will increase significantly, along with growing levels of road transport in the coming years, unfortunately. Thus it is imperative that we take action as soon as possible to ensure a sizeable reduction in new HGV CO2 emissions in the 2020-2030 period. The primary aspects of the proposal include introducing administrative fines where there is infringement in clearly-defined cases; making public certain data reported under the regulation, including air drag value in a range format; provisions to monitor and report results of on-road verification tests; measures to verify and correct other measures adopted by implementing acts. These are all important inclusions, and I think they will certainly help the situation. I am encouraged by this proposal and the opportunities it will create, as well as enabling fleet buyers to make more informed purchase decisions in order to boost competition between manufacturers and stimulate fuel efficiency and lower emissions in the freight sector. We depend heavily on innovation to sufficiently reduce our transport emissions, and I am certain there is a great potential to make significant strides forward in this regard.

I myself have been responsible for this issue in the EPP Group.  Without the truck, Europe will stop. We simply cannot do without it, and that is why we must do what we can to combat emissions from lorries. They account for a significant proportion of emissions. In Sweden alone, for example, road traffic accounts for about 30% of emissions and lorries account for 20% of that share.  There is a myth that trucks are not becoming more and more efficient. That is not true; they become more effective. In Sweden alone, emissions from heavy goods vehicles decreased by 11 per cent last year. It's not so strange; The person who buys a truck wants above all a truck that is fuel efficient, because that is the biggest cost when you buy a truck. Market forces work here very well to help the environment. The only problem is that it is not declining fast enough, and that is what we need to do something about. That is why we now have legislation to ensure that we better measure CO2 emissions from our heavy goods vehicles, and soon together we will also find legislation to limit emissions from heavy goods vehicles.  The big question we have debated here, and had conflicts about, is what information should become public. I have had an important principle that the information that manufacturers should have to publish about their products is the information we need to measure emissions, but some here seem to have the principle that all information on everything possible should be accessible to all. Almost as if the goal were for our products to be copied by others. Europe is a world leader in producing trucks and that is how it should remain, but then we will export environmentally friendly trucks, not sensitive information about how we produce our trucks. That is why I think that the trade-off we have struck here – to ensure that we publish information that reduces emissions, not that allows others to copy our trucks – is what is important.

Together we can be proud of the result of our joint effort to agree on this new piece of legislation. But before I conclude, allow me to respond to some of your comments. On transparency of data: the agreed text strikes the right balance between the need for increased transparency in the heavy-duty vehicle market and the need to protect commercially sensitive information. This approached, agreed for the publication, does strike such a balance considering the high influence of this parameter to the fuel consumption performance and hence CO2 emissions of vehicles. Of course I am referring to the air-drag values. On in-service conformity tests, this provision has the objective of ensuring that consumers get what they pay for and that the cars that are produced are as clean as the ones that are tested. The Commission had already included this provision in the context of the type approval reform, and the European Parliament had strongly backed this position during trilogues. Unfortunately, the final compromise for type approval did not manage to keep this provision. This is why we included it again in this legislation. Hopefully this time we will succeed. On alternative fuels, the Commission issued, in its second mobility package last November, a detailed action plan to accelerate the deployment of alternative fuels infrastructure throughout the EU. This also includes fast charging points for electrical vehicles, and the Commission dedicated EUR 450 million of cofinancing in its November 2017 CEF call to support these efforts. So the projects are now in the deployment phase. On diesel cars the Commission sees a need for accelerating the uptake of zero and low-emission vehicles in an effort to improve air quality and lower CO2 emissions, while following an approach of technological neutrality. While the proposal will speed up the market uptake of zero and low-emission vehicles, accelerating innovation and reaching economies of scale, the change in the fleet composition will be gradual. It is expected that at least 80% of new car fleets in 2030 will contain an internal combustion engine. So I do hope that additional innovation will be introduced, for use in combustion engines to qualify for at least low-emission vehicles. On imported vehicles: there is no doubt that all vehicles placed on the European market are subject to the same standards, either being manufactured here in Europe or imported from third countries. Finally, let me again stress the benefits of addressing HDV emissions, very quickly. First, transport operators, mainly SMEs, will save money at the pump. Second, we will keep and create new jobs here in Europe, up to 25 000 more jobs in 2025 are estimated. Third, we will invest and innovate here in Europe. Fourth, we will use and import less oil. And fifth, we will fight against climate change and improve the air we breathe, in particular in EU cities.

I would like to express my special thanks to the experts in the field of education, teachers, students, pupils and NGOs for their invaluable remarks. When I worked on the report, I adopted three main assumptions. Firstly, the traditional place of learning, the school, is today replaced by many other available sources. Modern technologies have freed up education, creating an educational space. A huge challenge for us is to create a school as the most interesting place of this space. Secondly, we appreciate the role of vocational education, we stress in the report the need to create a set of key competences, skills, but we remind you that the role of education systems is to educate a multidimensional man who is not only professionally, but also culturally, socially and civicly. Thirdly, we believe that the establishment of a civilisation pact based on well-funded high-quality education systems is a prerequisite for all development. That is why we are calling for both increased investment and greater synergies between the Structural Funds, investment funds and education. The report considers all levels of education. We stress the importance of pre-school and early childhood education. We support the establishment of a European framework for pre-school education in order to ensure the holistic development of the child. We see schools as centers of critical and creative thinking. This, of course, requires a paradigm shift in education, a shift away from verbal communication and mechanical memorization in favour of understanding, discussion, problem solving, but also the individualisation of the learning process.  Higher education plays a key role in the development of the intellectual potential and competitiveness of the European economy. We are very interested in the announcement of the creation of a European education area, but we stress that it must be correlated with the European Higher Education Area and the European Research Area in order to strengthen the knowledge triangle and achieve pro-innovation attitudes among graduates. We also support the creation of a European network of universities, assuming, however, that this should be a bottom-up initiative of the universities themselves.  There will be no change in education without teachers, so we draw attention to the need to recruit highly motivated, well-educated and mentally prepared teachers. However, this requires both a change in the way they are educated and a great deal of concern to improve their professional and material status. We have received with great interest the announcement of the creation of a European Teacher Academy, especially after the evident success of the January Education Summit.

I am responsible for preparing the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and in this opinion we emphasise that quality education is the right of every European and that the objectives of education go far beyond preparing graduates to find themselves on the labour market, although this labour market objective is of course very important.  We also note that the digitisation and automation of the labour market are changing the type of skills needed in the market. The demand for advanced skills and professions, including digital, mathematical, engineering skills, is increasing and the need for simple, non-skilled work is reduced. This fact should finally be taken into account by Member States in their education policies, which must effectively combat secondary illiteracy and school drop-out, as well as better educate university students.  We also stress that there is a growing demand for soft skills in the labour market that require practical, open, environmental education, and that teachers, the quality of their education and the freedom to choose a curriculum and teaching methods are key to a good quality education.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 96, "date": "2018-06-11.json", "name": "Agnieszka KOZŁOWSKA", "mepid": "124889", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, Madam Łybacka, I’m very pleased to have this debate with you today. You underline in your report the crucial role of education in shaping the future of Europe. I couldn’t agree more. The transformation of our societies and economies creates changing education realities that need urgent responses if we want to offer bright futures to all our young people. In fact, over the last year or so the topic of education has visibly moved up on the EU’s agenda. In March 2017, the Rome Declaration called for a Union where young people receive the best education and training and can study and find jobs across the continent. In November last year, EU leaders debated education at the Gothenburg Social Summit and adopted conclusions on the topic at the December European Council.  With this mandate, the Commission has recently outlined its vision for a European education area where people can move freely to study, learn and train, and where we can offer high quality and innovative education for all our citizens. I thank you for your explicit support for the European education area. This project is based on three objectives. Firstly, to promote cross-border mobility and cooperation in education and training. Secondly, to remove unjustified obstacles that make it difficult to learn, train or work abroad. Our aim is to make the free movement of learners possible and to create a genuine European learning space. Thirdly, to support Member States in making their education and training systems more inclusive and innovative and to base them on the idea of lifelong learning. On 22 May 2018, we proposed a second set of concrete steps towards turning the vision of a European education area into reality following a first batch of proposals we tabled in January. In May, the Commission presented three proposals for Council recommendations. First, a recommendation on the automatic mutual recognition of higher education and upper secondary education diplomas and the outcomes of learning periods abroad. I firmly believe that we can only succeed in building a strong European identity if young people are free to study and learn in another EU country, unimpeded by administrative hurdles. Let us remove the recognition obstacle, at least inside the EU, once and for all.  Second, we want a comprehensive approach to the teaching and learning of languages. Our societies, our economy and the European project itself depend on our citizens being able to communicate with each other. Alas, multilingualism is far from being a reality in the EU. It is high time we stepped up our efforts to be a truly multilingual Europe. Third, high-quality early childhood education and care systems. Evidence shows that if learning opportunities are missed at an early age, it takes much greater efforts to make up the deficit later. The Commission proposal aims to create a quality framework for early childhood education and care with the aim of giving all children the best possible start in life. We have outlined some key initiatives in support of the European education area. Let me mention just some them. First, the European universities. These will boost cross-border cooperation between higher education institutions. Higher education institutions which share the same vision and values will develop long-term institutional strategies for top quality education, research and innovation. The Commission aims to launch pilot projects in 2019 and 2020 under the Erasmus+ programme. Second, the European student card will simplify learning mobility by reducing administrative burdens and costs for students and educational institutions. The aim is to make it available to all Erasmus students by 2021 as a visible symbol of European student identity.  Third, with the graduate tracking initiative, we have launched the first ever European survey of graduates in eight pilot countries, with initial results expected by the end of 2019. All these initiatives build on the first proposals on the European education area we put forward in January. Back then, the Commission had launched an ambitious digital education action plan. This promotes digitalisation and innovation-driven approaches in education. A new European framework of key competences reminds us that we have to invest more in developing basic and digital skills, civic competencies and entrepreneurial attitudes, and we have to encourage more young people to study science, technology, engineering and mathematics. Finally, the Council recommendation on promoting common values, inclusive education and the European dimension of teaching was also tabled in January and adopted by ministers in May. Never before has the EU said so clearly how important it is to promote our common values, to create a sense of belonging, to teach about the functioning values and origins of the European Union and, most importantly, to learn about the cultural and historical diversity of Member States.  Madam Łybacka your excellent report and its constructive recommendations come at just the right moment. On 30 May, we presented our proposals for the future Erasmus programme, which will continue to play a key role in delivering the objectives of the European education area.  Let me take this opportunity to warmly thank this House for your unwavering support for an ambitious Erasmus programme post 2020, with an increased budget that is proportionate to the size of our ambition. I agree that we need to make the programme more inclusive and accessible. Our proposal will allow 12 million people, more than ever before, to participate in different types of exchanges while reaching out to more people of all social backgrounds. In order to reach new groups of learners, the Commission proposes to increase support for school pupil mobility, mobility of learners in vocational education and training, and youth mobility.  Furthermore, the Commission wants to provide more flexible formats for learning mobility, such as short-term and group activities and virtual mobility. We also want to make it easier for smaller and grassroots organisations to take part, in particular community-based organisations that work with disadvantaged learners of all ages.  I would like to thank you, Madam Łybacka, for your excellent cooperation in drawing up this report.

The report emphasises the importance of education, its economic and social aspects in the changed information society. Youth unemployment remains worrying in many Member States, but knowledge and qualifications are still the highest, with a lower unemployment rate among graduates than among those without qualifications. It is therefore important that Member States invest in improving the quality of education systems and infrastructure in response to current challenges, updating curricula so that students can acquire useful, applicable and practical knowledge. The report emphasises the importance of vocational training and dual training, the coordination of educational institutions and content with the world of work, labour market and contemporary needs, and the increase in the prestige of vocational work. I am pleased that the subject of the mother tongue education of national minorities has also been included in the report, since the right to use the mother tongue is an existential issue for minorities in the process of education. The report states that Member States should make greater efforts to ensure that pupils from indigenous minorities have access to all levels of education in their mother tongue and that institutions teaching minority languages receive priority support. The recommendations included the acquisition of a full range of key competences, such as foreign languages, digital skills and entrepreneurship, not least the competence of lifelong learning. The report pays particular attention to teachers: Member States should encourage young people to choose the pedagogical profession in order to make the teaching profession attractive and prestigious again, and teacher training has a key role to play. Following the good example in Hungary, it was included in the report's recommendations that Member States should make greater efforts to access early and early childhood education, so that Member States can provide more places for kindergartens and crèches, especially for children from disadvantaged families. Since 2010, the Hungarian Government has launched a number of initiatives in the field of early childhood education and public education, providing free school meals and textbooks for students. This is a good example of the early catch-up that many states need.

We live in a time when new technologies and digitalisation are evolving at a rapid pace and education systems need to keep up with these developments. Otherwise, our educational establishments will continue to produce future unemployed and staff who do not master the skills of the 21st century. When talking about modernizing education, this should not be understood as renovating only the material base of educational establishments and buying modern equipment. It is important to keep up with new technologies, but they do not guarantee adolescents that they will be able to better learn, skills and competences. The results of the international Pisa study show that the availability of modern digital infrastructure does not increase students' results, and this is not surprising.  The problem of functional literacy is also well known to the Bulgarian system. Our students are overwhelmed with huge amounts of theoretical knowledge, which is at the expense of stimulating critical thinking. We need a holistic approach, an approach that also takes into account the needs of our teachers, because without them no reform can be successful. The attitude towards them is indicative of the attitude towards the whole education system.  Raising their wages will not solve problems with a magic wand. They must have more autonomy and access to career opportunities. To this end, however, only the opportunities provided by European programmes should not be relied on.

We believe that we have focused on those points that were necessary, but they are necessary in the countries, in our countries, because we are countries and we are Europe. I believe that this modernisation, which looks with interest at language skills, looks with great interest at digital skills and media skills, considering that the school container is not the only place where people can be trained, and also looks at lifelong learning and lifelong learning, is at the heart of all our reasoning. You know that as the ECR Group we have tabled amendments and we have co-signed many amendments on a subject that is very dear to us: freedom and educational choice, the family – that great resource that we have perhaps forgotten for a time – and the community, able to participate actively. It is clear that, faced with the possibility of teachers who can form and propose themselves constantly, not in terms of their ability to be teachers and economic capacity, but in terms of their ability to participate actively, they are central to the training and development of our community. That's why I believe that when we say that freedom and educational choice are the responsibility of the family, it means that they compete with the community.

I believe that we must stress more than all the improvements in education that we demand from the institutional, the public, will only work if we assume what we have to do with each other as citizens, as parents. We cannot assume that we comply, and not to do so delegitimates us to demand anything from teachers, teachers and the system in which they work.  We need an equal education. No stereotypes.

Quality education creates active and engaged citizens and increases the employability and mobility of young people, as well as contributing to building the economy as a whole. The modernisation of education systems across Europe is a pressing need, and one that must address deep structural challenges. It is the responsibility of Member States and devolved governments – such as we have in Wales, where full powers over education are devolved – to implement reforms, but the EU can assist their efforts. This report presents excellent recommendations on how to do that. One point that I especially welcome, and one that has been mentioned by several colleagues, is the importance given to the teacher as a guarantor of quality teaching. Earlier this year, I went with some others here on a study visit to Finland. Teachers there are highly trained and highly respected. To become a teacher, candidates must have passed at least a master’s degree, and many students try to be accepted on training courses for teachers and fail. It was clear that the status of teachers within society also changed the view of the value of education itself. So I am very glad that this report calls for measures to raise the status of the teacher. With the creation of the European Education Area under way, this is a crucial period where cooperation across the EU must be a priority.

Modernising education, in order to be in the interests of the many, must have as its necessary conditions: a brave increase in public spending on education policies, ensuring access for all levels of education, education systems focusing on pupils and students rather than the imperatives of the markets and strengthening policies to combat youth unemployment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 104, "date": "2018-06-11.json", "name": "Isabella ADINOLFI", "mepid": "124831", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur and my fellow Members for their excellent work. The final text represents a good political compromise on an issue that is crucial for the future of our society, that of the modernisation of education in Europe, where the rate of functional illiteracy is still dramatically high. There are mainly three aspects of the recommendations addressed to the Commission and the Member States that I would like to highlight here. The first concerns the fundamental role of public investment. Without a quality, state-of-the-art education and training system, there can be no real change that is needed today, as never before, to better meet the challenges that the globalised world, technological advances and economic and political crises pose. In line with public investment, there is also the fight against the precariousness of teachers, who are the pillars of the system, who must be guaranteed decent working conditions that no longer mortify their decisive activity, which accompanies students from pre-primary school to university and which ensures that critical and conscious citizens are formed. Finally, the third aspect concerns the increase in functional and media literacy policies. This is something that is too little talked about and which is crucial. I am convinced that we need a common response and a serious medium- and long-term plan, and the text adopted, in this regard, addresses this issue appropriately and outlines good solutions. I would like to close by saying that what makes me most proud of my work is the recognition of the right to education as a fundamental human right, which must be guaranteed to everyone, especially those who are in difficult or disadvantaged situations, such as disabled people or people from difficult backgrounds.

Mr President, in 2000 the Lisbon Strategy claimed to make the European Union the most competitive, dynamic and knowledge-based space. Fourteen years later, the Commission set a golden age of 2020 at which 40% of a generation would be awarded a higher education degree and 85% would have mastered basic knowledge. Weas, the international rankings follow each other and are similar and the numbers are stubborn. For example, the QS ranking, published on 6 June, takes the first university in continental Europe - excluding Switzerland - to 50th place on the basis of the opinion of some 42,000 employers. One can certainly protest against the criteria used, a bit like facing the defeat of a great sportsman - it is good to curse the weather, the freshness of the turf or the bias of the referee. However, Pisa tests, which see certain European regions competing with developing countries, to the dilapidation of our research, as evidenced by the mass exodus of researchers, all confirm that, in fierce global competition, Europe seems to have given up its arms. How could it be otherwise when, with guidelines, the European Union is constantly watering Member States with old-fashioned pedagogical lubies undermining the foundations of centuries-old national traditions. I am thinking of the totem of new technologies in schools, whereas from the OECD to the American Academy of Pediatrics, everyone now recognizes their deleterious effect on academic performance and mental health. Not to mention the over-consumption of pornographic and violent online content or the risks associated with cyber-harassment, the consequences of which on the psychological, emotional and emotional development of young people are sometimes irreversible. I also think of the contempt for the hierarchy between the teacher and the pupil, which resonates with a cruel echo at a time when fear has become a familiar companion for so many teachers in the lost suburbs of the French Republic. But the most striking is the glaring contradiction between the aspiration for excellence and diversity. Thus, while more than 15% of heads of disadvantaged schools in France and Belgium consider diversity of origin as an obstacle to learning, the arrival of an exponential number of migrants in the school systems will be all the more calamitous since it has no consequent effort of assimilation, the requirement of mastery of language giving way to that of multilingualism. Teachers are now being urged to encourage migrants to learn their mother tongue. It is far from the time when cohorts of immigrants came from the far reaches of Poland or Italy, sacrificing their language and identity on the altar of a new homeland of hope and social promotion.

I do not know whether this is the most appropriate concept, the most appropriate word, but there is no doubt that education responds to key challenges, not only in Europe, not only in Europe, but also in the world. It must be remembered that, when we recently debated parliament in Strasbourg, we said that nearly 30 percent of young people up to the age of 25 are either out of work or without education or without one and the other. This is a challenge for all of us, how do we get to the situation that the rapporteur is talking about? First of all, by combining modernisation programmes in those groups that are mentioned in the report itself, that is, higher education, these are teachers themselves, that is, the ability to also take advantage of changes in civilisation, that is, also technology, but it is also research, as well as better responding to the changing needs of the market.

His own-initiative report is certainly one of the most important in this parliamentary term because of the subject he is dealing with. The things that my fellow Members and also the Commissioner have said are right in my statement.  We know about the changes that are taking place. It is a question of taking these changes not as problems, but as challenges, and of addressing them with a truly global approach, involving the whole of education policy. If we want to create a European Area of Education and Training, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, high-quality universal education is essential. However, this must also become a real political priority for the Member States. It is also essential to provide strong financial support at every level, that is, to schools of all levels, both public and private non-profit, in the knowledge that investing in education is not only and cannot be just an economic imperative, but that in a globalised world it is one of the essential factors for the full development of every person, in all its dimensions.  It is therefore right, on the one hand, to reaffirm the fundamentals, the right to freedom of educational choice for parents, to guarantee all citizens of the Union the learning of basic skills, including, of course, digital skills, equal access to inclusive and quality education and also as a social lift and, on the other hand, to place the emphasis on the so-called modernisation components, which I shall briefly summarise. : educational resources and teaching methods that use the new opportunities, the theme of the disabled, from childhood and not only those who have been treated as an essential element, the so-called triangle of knowledge and the improvement of the link between research and teaching. There would be various things to add. I would like to conclude by recalling the centrality of the figure of the teacher, who must on the one hand be the guarantor and cornerstone for the change in the education system.

According to a recent World Bank document, Romania’s education system is failing: 40% of Romanian students are functionally illiterate, and one in five children drop out of school. Adding to this, the skills of the workforce have not kept up with the increasing sophistication of the economy and the switch in exports from labour-intensive to high-technology sectors.

I am hopeful that through pushes from the Semester process, and with instruments such as the ESF and the SRSP, we will be able to move on together.

I consider the issue of modernising education in the EU to be a very important document and I clearly support it. We need to see that the embrace of education and the prioritisation of education challenges are pillars on which Europe's competitiveness can continue to be built. I can fully identify with the basic thesis of the document. These are: emphasising the need for quality education, creating and coordinating the necessary conditions at EU and Member State level, supporting the various elements of cooperation between higher education institutions, the possibility of increasing language and institutional competences, emphasising the importance of lifelong learning and involving a number of modern and innovative elements in educational processes. I am also pleased that the document also pays attention to the teaching of pupils from minorities in their mother tongue. This element is also important because it is the second document this year, which also focuses on the education of minorities at European Parliament level. I would like to recall that on the 7th of February this year the European Parliament voted in favour of the decision 'protecting minorities and prohibiting their discrimination in the EU Member States', which also emphasises that the protection of minorities is also a responsibility at European level. I appreciate that the report, which is otherwise very complex, also supports the promotion of the education and use of regional and minority languages.

It is a commitment to orientation for professional life with the horizon of entering the world of work. It is an education that we advocate, which must be concerned with informing from the concrete reality of local life, of the country, but also of the international community. The modernisation of education in Europe cannot be induced from the outside. It consists of an inside process, which implies reflection and criticism. The real innovation of education is not only in terms of \"more technology\", but is in being able to change pedagogical practices and this is not done without teachers. They are the ones who can make education a tool to combat discrimination, particularly gender discrimination. Education was the one that paid the crisis the most. Therefore, continued public financial support should be increased. That is why I do not understand the cuts, the present cuts, in the European Social Fund. Above all we must ensure a teaching that is free, public and free. Modernizing education is getting rid of the manufacturing model and assembly lines that marked the school of the 19th century. Equality is therefore not a minor issue in education, it is a question of justice, it is a question of democracy, it is a question of freedom. If we assume that school can be a place of social reproduction, and that actually happens, then we will be in a position to pursue what unites us the most: the equality of existence and being who we are. The European Union urgently needs to rethink education. This modernisation of European education will be so much faster the more we are able to reflect on the social function of the school and on democracy.

Properly funded high-quality early years provision should be the bedrock of our education systems. We also need to see a continued focus on apprenticeships and vocational learning.

As some speakers have said, we have to start with the young, but above all we must start with teachers. As a former teacher myself, I realise how important teaching is. One area where we need to put more emphasis is allowing teachers to have access to continuing professional development (CPD). There is not enough opportunity for them to do that on a professional basis, as distinct from a voluntary basis, and that will make a huge difference. As well as that, we have been putting emphasis in Ireland on the STEM subjects in recent times, and that needs to continue. We especially need to encourage girls into the STEM subjects, and bodies like the voluntary group, CoderDojo, are doing tremendous work to encourage people at a very young age with skills in that area to develop them.

Technological development and globalisation are creating new challenges. They also cover education systems. The task of education systems in the information society is not only the transfer of knowledge and skills for their application, but also training to develop knowledge, which is a source of competitiveness and the well-being of citizens and the most important economic resources. I welcome the Commission's idea of creating a European education area. However, it should be noted that this area must be consistent with the results achieved so far in the European Higher Education Area and the European Research and Innovation Area. In addition, the European Education Area must receive strong political support from Member States whose joint efforts will provide a new impetus for the development of education, while ensuring respect for the principle of subsidiarity, freedom of education and institutional autonomy.

Ladies and gentlemen, aquaculture in the European Union provides sustainable and high quality products to the consumer, and we can only be proud of our European sector. However, although aquaculture has maintained a sustained pace of growth globally and for half a century, its full potential has not just been unleashed in the European Union. The growth of the sector sometimes runs into several problems. These include the lack of available maritime space for its activities or administrative obstacles, particularly those arising from licensing procedures, or competition on the world market, combined with insufficient consumer information on aquaculture products from third countries, in terms of their quality, environmental footprint, social conditions, fish welfare... or the poor preconceived image that aquaculture sometimes has of citizens, etc., etc. It is true that good initiatives and intentions abound. In 2009, the European Commission issued a communiqué focused on building a sustainable future for aquaculture. And in 2013 he published another on the strategy guidelines for sustainable aquaculture development in the European Union. The new common fisheries policy also aims, inter alia, to give new impetus to aquaculture in the European Union, allocating for its dissemination funding of EUR 1.2 trillion for the period 2014 to 2020. However, implementation did not match the industry's expectations, and initial enthusiasm soon turned into disappointment and defeatism. What do we need to do, then? The strategies proposed by the European Commission remain very relevant today. We must simplify administrative procedures, ensuring sustainable development and aquaculture growth through spatial coordination planning, strengthening aquaculture competences in the European Union or promoting a level playing field for European Union operators and exploiting their competitive advantages. And all of this remains a challenge that must be faced. A large group of scientific advisors recently issued, in a petition by Commissioner Vella, a report entitled 'Food from the oceans: How can more food and biomass be obtained from the oceans without depriving future generations of their benefits?\". Your recommendations, ladies and gentlemen, are very relevant, and I share them all completely. A paradigm, as they say, of responsible culture on ocean food must be integrated into general policy agendas at the european and global systems level. And also, as this report says, we must take the development of mariculture in Europe to a higher and more strategic level, through a comprehensive and coordinated political strategy. Well, in short: the problems have been identified, the diagnosis is good and the solutions proposed so far are very relevant. What is needed is a political impetus within a context of mutual respect for the role of each between the institutions of the European Union and the local and regional administrations of the Member States. Thus, the necessary doses of subsidiarity for aquaculture management in the European Union should be mixed with enhanced action at European Union level, setting targets at European Union level, while opting for regionalised objectives tailored to the particularities of each aquaculture branch at local and regional level. I'm done, ladies and gentlemen. We should not forget that the European Parliament has been a co-legislator since 2009 and that any future policy will have to be jointly drawn up by the Council and the European Parliament. And I'm particularly proud of these achievements. I conclude by saying that there are imminent opportunities and appointments that we must not miss in order to give the European Union's saltwater and freshwater aquaculture the place it deserves.

I welcome the fact that your report recognises the importance of developing a sustainable and competitive European aquaculture sector. This report builds on the momentum of the ‘Food from the oceans’ report submitted by the Commission’s High Level Scientific Advice Mechanism. It highlights the fact that aquaculture can and must grow in the future to feed a planet with 10 billion inhabitants. First of all, let me recall that we have already done a lot to create a positive environment for the sustainable development of EU aquaculture. Together with Member States, industry and other stakeholders, the Commission first identified in 2013 the main barriers to growth for EU aquaculture and has been working since to help Member States address them and stimulate growth. The main blueprints for development are the Member States’ multi-annual strategic plans for aquaculture, on which they have made good progress, in particular by developing maritime spacial planning and reforming overly-complicated national laws. The Commission is currently undertaking a mid-term review of the EU’s and Member States’ progress on aquaculture since these plans were established. Our review will be finalised in mid-2019. We are meeting regularly with Member States in the context of the open method of coordination and with stakeholders through the Advisory Aquaculture Council. We have a constructive dialogue with the key players at national level and those involved in production. Your report gives this work an additional political impetus, especially through the links you have established with key players, such as regional authorities and developers, during its preparation. At the initiative of this House, the Commission is also starting a pilot project on trans-national producer organisations, which will hopefully foster cross-border cooperation and increase interactions within the sector. I am proud of the significant funding the EU invests in research and innovation: around EUR 20 million per year under Horizon 2020, as well as in communication to promote sustainable aquaculture in the EU. Under the current EMFF, EUR 1.2 billion, which is approximately 21% of the total EMFF budget, have been allocated directly to the promotion of aquaculture. Your report rightly stresses the need for imported aquaculture products to meet the same standards that EU operators must meet. Let me recall that imported aquaculture products are already subject to strict sanitary requirements and that the European Commission is carrying out regular inspections in third countries to control compliance with EU legislation. Despite the important successes we have already reached together thanks to hard work and commitment, we are fully aware that more has to be done. We need to see even more improvements at administrative level: more reduction of red tape when it comes to licensing new farms – a number of Member States have made clear moves in this direction. More need to follow, and a commitment to simplification and adequate support needs to be taken by the regional authorities who ultimately take the relevant decisions. I share your opinion that support to innovation is needed, and we will support smart ideas and approaches that make the sector more sustainable and more competitive. One way we are working on this is through the launch of a Blue Bioeconomy Forum, which should be operational in the third quarter of 2018, and which will help identify a project pipeline, draft a roadmap for the development of the sector and find new markets and value chains. We are also working on a Blue Economy Investment Platform to support innovative business ideas in the blue economy that have reached the post-research stage, but are not yet ready for full-scale investment. This platform will help mobilise funding from both private and public resources, including the European Fund for Strategic Investment. And of course, there is continued support for aquaculture development in the current and the new EMFF, as well as funding for research through the Horizon 2020 programme. I’m looking forward to continuing to work with you on further promoting aquaculture and developing a competitive and sustainable aquaculture sector in the EU.

Sure, recreational fishing is considered a hobby, but it is a hobby of cultural heritage, the traditions of many communities in coastal and island areas. It is an activity that has an economic influence unfortunately easily ignored in our common fishing policies. With regard to marine recreational fishing alone, nine million people are involved and the economic impact of this activity is over EUR 10 billion annually. And as far as freshwater fishing is concerned, which is happening in the vast majority of European countries, more than 25 million European citizens are involved, and the industry associated with this fishing activity is around EUR 25 billion. Sure, it is a subsidiarity area, but it is an area that will play an important role in what we call the 'blue economy' and in the circular economy. Unfortunately, the scientific data at the moment are insufficient for several species of fish. They are present, but it is necessary, for a coherent definition of this activity, to have a solid scientific support. And I call on the Commission to support and stimulate the collection of scientific data on recreational fishing in the Member States in order to have a very clear vision of this activity, in order to have a relatively uniform definition throughout the European Union. Recreational fishing is different in every state, as I said, is part of a cultural given of many communities, but often, for many communities, it is a subsistence fishery and the only source of food for communities in the peripheral areas in particular. The economic activity that can be carried out and which can bring a great deal of jobs to the European Union must also be supported and I call on the European Commission to include recreational fishing among the themes of the year for the EDEN project for sustainable tourism and to initiate us into the COSME fund projects to promote tourism generated by recreational fishing. It is very important to give a chance to diversify economic options in communities that are marginalised and environmentally dependent on this type of fishing. We also call on the European Commission, on the basis of the 2013 definition of the International Maritime Action Operations Council, to try to define this activity clearly in the future fisheries policy; we also ask for financial support for scientific research in the field, for the collection of data in order to determine the level of fish stocks. All this will certainly shape a role of recreational fishing in the common fisheries policy. We believe that the funds in the EMFF must also be for this activity because, at a time of change, with climate challenges, with challenges related to food issues, recreational fishing is a chance not only of recreation, but also of life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 152, "date": "2018-06-11.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur once again, because she has embarked on a difficult subject.

This activity has a relevant social and economic impact in many ports and coastal areas, however there is room to improve its framework in places where there is a need to redirect fishermen to other activities.

Providing a comprehensive overview of the state of play of recreational fisheries in the EU and drawing public attention to this topic is extremely useful and necessary. Scientific advice increasingly suggests that recreational fisheries can have an important impact on the state of some stocks. This is, for instance, the case with cod in the Baltic, sea bass in the Atlantic, and eels. In some of these cases, recreational catches could actually be more important than commercial catches. The Commission is monitoring this situation closely and proposes measures for recreational fisheries on a case—by—case basis when science advises that these are needed. To give you some examples: for eels, the EU regulation requires Member States to make estimates of recreational fishing licenses and their catches. For Western Baltic cod and sea bass in the Bay of Biscay, bag limits currently apply to recreational fisheries. For the northern stock of sea bass, only the catch-and-release practice is allowed. Let me mention here the pilot project proposed by Parliament to reinforce the control schemes for recreational catches of sea bass in the Atlantic. The study will evaluate existing control measures and tools, identify the strengths and weaknesses of available solutions, assess the costs and benefits of different options, explore good practices and propose recommendations or guidelines to improve control schemes. More generally, the control regulation requires Member States to monitor recreational catches of stocks, subject to recovery plans, excluding fishing from shore. This implies the establishment of sampling plans and biannual reporting to the Commission. This provision is intended to ensure the appropriate monitoring of recreational fisheries of depleted stocks. Our proposal for the revision of the control regulation, adopted only two weeks ago, goes even further. It acknowledges that recreational fishing can have a significant impact on certain stocks and provides for specific tools allowing an effective control of recreational fisheries by the Member States. For example, we are proposing that Member States establish a registration or licensing system to monitor the number of natural and legal persons involved in recreational fisheries and also to collect data on catches from such fisheries through catch reporting or other appropriate data collection mechanisms. Furthermore, for stocks where EU conservation measures apply to recreational fisheries, the Commission proposes that Member States ensure that all persons involved in recreational fisheries record and send catch declarations electronically to the competent authorities on a daily basis or after each fishing trip. To make this happen, we need solid databases, in particular for stock assessment purposes. The ICES Working Group on Recreational Fisheries Surveys highlighted that data from Member States are still missing, in particular in the Mediterranean. To remedy this, we have now made it compulsory for Member States to provide such data and conduct validation pilot projects within two years of the entry into force of the new EU multiannual programme for data collection. This deadline of two years will expire on 31 December 2018. This is a big step forward, as the conservation of some marine biological resources might indeed require measures on recreational fisheries, and these cannot be properly shaped without reliable data. This being said, the one—size—fits—all approach cannot be applied regarding recreational fisheries. This is an issue that we need to look into on a case—by—case basis, stock by stock, also when preparing proposals for multiannual management plans. While the Baltic MAP does not include provisions on recreational fisheries, both the Western Waters MAP and the MAP for demersal fisheries in the western Mediterranean cover recreational fisheries for stocks, where these have an important impact. This shows that the Commission is actively engaging in the discussion around the impact of recreational fisheries. We are open to your ideas and views to further address this issue with a view to ensuring the sustainability of stocks for future generations and the long—term viability of this segment of the sector. Your report provides precious information and guidance in this respect.

Corruption, the abandonment of refugees are taking the Union into spectacular discredit, while in Spain there are political prisoners and there are exiles who are elected politicians or artists or simple citizens who exercise their democratic rights.  The scandal is capital. Either the European Union reacts, either its laments against dictatorships and injustices in the world will be nothing more than cynical alarides of those who share, but do not fight, the undemocratic principles of fascism and the anti-democratic far right.

We cannot afford to have it trivialised and commercialised, especially not when we still have so much unfinished work to do for the LGBT+ community.  Trans people suffer from the highest rates of repetitive violence and hate motivated crimes. Ireland has the second highest prevalence in the EU of hate motivated violence against trans people. Between 2014 and 2016, 62 transgender hate crimes took place on the island of Ireland. So this year, let’s not celebrate Pride by patting ourselves on the back for marriage equality. Let’s make Pride the political struggle it ought to be. Instead of visibility of billion dollar social media networks, let’s have visibility of trans identities.
