I would also like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions, as well as my colleagues in the ECR Secretariat. As you know, the right to petition the European Parliament is enshrined in the European Treaties. This is an important right which derives from European citizenship itself. Of course, every citizen, according to the Treaty, but also every permanent resident of the European Union has the right to report on an issue which falls within the scope of the European Union. At the political level, this right is particularly important, as it enables citizens to express themselves, linking them to the European Parliament itself. Besides, the Committee on Petitions is the only committee in which the citizens themselves participate, as they intervene as petitioners. In this sense, it is also an indirect mechanism for monitoring the application of European Union law, and so there is an interconnection with the Commission itself and, of course, we will listen with particular interest to the views of the Commission, Mr Vella in this case, on how the Commission views the functioning of the Committee on Petitions. But I would say that Mr. Timmermans's frequent involvement in our work also gives us a clue as to how and at what level this cooperation should exist, a cooperation that is definitely important, because citizens raise important issues through petitions, such as are the right to free movement, issues related to the implementation of fundamental rights, issues concerning the rights of the child and people with disabilities, but of course the concerns of citizens for the protection of the environment are also expressed through the Committee on Petitions, which also has a direct relationship and close cooperation with the European Ombudsman. So I would say that the issues that occupied in 2016 but also concern the Committee on Petitions this year are important. In particular, we were concerned about the Marrakesh agreement on the rights of the blind, the rights also arising from the Istanbul agreement, the rights of the child, and we had received many reports of Brexit, because the people are worried, especially its citizens. European Union, what will happen to their rights after the United Kingdom leaves the European Union. An important issue that concerned us in 2016 was German compensation, an issue which, as you know, I have raised since the first moment of my election here in the European Parliament, since there is a demand from Greece, which is determined by its decisions. of the 1946 peace agreement, which set out Germany's obligation to make war reparations to Greece, to repay, of course, the forced occupation loan, and to compensate the relatives of the victims executed by the Nazi occupation troops. This issue was raised with the report of the fighters of the National Resistance and the Democratic Army of Greece, on 2214/2014. With my intervention, this petition in September 2015 was deemed admissible and then the procedure for discussion was opened. We made a lot of efforts in order to put this specific report on the shelf, not to discuss it, and unfortunately the majority of the coordinators of the Committee on Petitions on 8.9.2016 considered that this issue allegedly does not fall within the competences of the European Union and closed the file. . This was therefore mentioned in paragraph 16 of my report. Unfortunately, the European People's Party, the Socialist Group and the Liberals did not accept this position, they tabled an amendment and this view has been deleted through the report. But this What was unprecedented, Mr President, was that the report was also asked to change. This never happens and so any reference to German reparations has been removed from the report. Beyond that, this is an issue that has preoccupied us, because otherwise there are no particular problems in the report that we will discuss. We have to mention this because it is important. I am waiting for the opinions of colleagues and I reserve the right, in the 2 minutes I have after the end of the discussion, to answer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-12-14.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, let me begin by thanking the rapporteur Mr Marias for his accurate and comprehensive report on the activities of the Committee on Petitions in 2016. I also take the opportunity to thank Ms Wikström and the whole Committee on Petitions for its important work. Like its predecessors in previous years, the report gives evidence of the broad spectrum of issues that petitioners bring to the Committee on Petitions’ attention each year, and of the committee’s efforts to ensure that the voices of those petitioners are heard. The Commission shares Parliament’s view that the right to petition is both a fundamental right of all EU citizens and a key element of participatory democracy, allowing for citizens’ active engagement in the fields of EU action. Petitions are an effective channel for direct contact and an open dialogue on problems affecting citizens in their daily life, especially in this day and age where democracy requires new ways and means to connect the EU’s institutions to the citizens they serve. This is also another very important tool to understand the pulse of Europe. Citizens often turn to the committee as a last resort because they feel that they have exhausted all other avenues and we – I mean both the Commission and Parliament – can demonstrate that we listen to their concerns and take them seriously, by offering proper responses and showing existing solutions at European or national level. This is a concrete example of how we can collaborate to restore citizens’ confidence and trust in the European project. As the report points out, our institutions have built good working relationships in recent years when it comes to handling petitions. Of the petitions declared admissible by Parliament in 2016, more than two-thirds were referred to the Commission for an opinion. In return, the 900 replies that the Commission sent back to Parliament in 2016 testify to our engagement to support the critical work of the Committee, which the Commission takes very seriously. All Commission replies are widely consulted among services, and suitably ranked officials with expert knowledge of the issues discussed are there to assist in the Committee’s meetings with the aim of providing the most meaningful and up to date information in a timely manner, as your report also recognises. I note the report’s insistence on providing ever better answers, and to be sure there is always room for improvement and the Commission will recommit itself to improving wherever we can in our effort to provide meaningful answers in a timely manner. I am therefore pleased to reaffirm the commitment of the Commission to keep up our good collaboration and to bring forward the EU added value in the resolution of petitioners’ concerns. Let me turn specifically to one of the issues raised prominently in the report by Mr Marias, namely the implementation of EU legislation. The Commission attaches particular importance to acting firmly and quickly when infringement proceedings are launched, especially when they obstruct key EU policy objectives. To this goal, the Commission adopted, in its communication ‘EU law: Better Results through Better Application’ of December 2016, a new approach to infringement policy that is more strategic, effective and proportionate. Moreover, it will also not automatically rely on the EU Pilot mechanism unless we see it as particularly useful on a case-by-case basis. Another concrete step to enhance transparency of decisions on infringement procedures is the centralised platform on our Europa website where the Commission proactively disseminates information on infringements. The Commission will continue to provide Parliament and the public with comprehensive information on monitoring the implementation of EU legislation and its follow-up. However, this needs to be done while respecting confidentiality obligations towards Member States in infringement procedures, as recognised by the European Court of Justice. The report also touches upon a number of other important issues, for which the views of Parliament and the Commission largely converge. Let me only mention the high priority in preserving citizens’ rights after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union, or the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. I will however, Mr President, end my remarks by once again thanking Mr Marias for his is very helpful report. I look forward to hearing the views of the honourable Members in the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-12-14.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, first I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his work. Except, of course, for this obsession with German debt, he did his job very well, I think. This is an important report, which highlights the highlights of our activities over the past year. The work of the Committee on Petitions has improved a lot and gained in efficiency since the introduction of the new administrative procedure in 2014. Indeed, it is essential that the Parliament processes petitions and provides a response to citizens in a timely manner. reasonable time. This requires focusing on the petitions that are eligible. Another point on the functioning of our commission: the working groups. These should have a well-defined mandate with the objective of facilitating the processing of petitions. The network of the PETI commission is an essential tool which would benefit from being better known because it makes it possible to make the link between petitions and legislative work within Parliament. We have dealt with essential topics for petitioners this year, one of those topics being Brexit. Our committee is a fervent defender of citizens' rights. Whether it is British people or other Europeans, their concerns are legitimate and we must do everything to ensure that they are successful. There is also the European Citizens 'Initiative, which must now be used optimally to increase citizens' confidence in the European institutions.

This report highlights the important work that the PETI Committee has done in being a voice for citizens’ concerns. Thanks to the secretariat and to all of the Petitions team in the European Parliament for their hard work in ensuring that that voice can be heard.  MEPs across the European Parliament should take our work more seriously. This is the place where personal stories of EU action, inaction and legislation are heard, as people talk about the EU needing to re-engage with the public; why not better use the tools we already have to do that? The number of petitions received shows that citizens care about their right to petition. We have to do better in outreach, and we need the resources to be able to meet their expectations. This report highlights ways to make the Petitions Committee more accessible in the future, to allow more people to directly present their cases through the use of technology, such as videoconferencing. Of the petitions we received, many were related to Brexit, both UK citizens living in the rest of the EU and citizens from the rest of the EU living in the UK, as well as raising concerns about the future of their rights, as well as UK citizens angry about losing their EU citizenship. Citizens are already feeling the cold effect of Brexit and this Parliament must listen attentively to their concerns and defend them actively.  2016 was also the year when the new committee guidelines came into play. We in the S&amp;D Group welcome the new method of working as it is based on full consensus across the political groups and a common understanding which adds to the democratic way we work inside our committee. I would remind the EPP that previous administrative rules were never endorsed by the committee, despite their attempts to include reference to them in amendments today.

I was supposed to speak on behalf of the ALDE Group, but I believe that true democrats will forgive me: I am going to speak on behalf of aliens, and these aliens have nothing in common with Mr George Lucas, the famous director. Aliens are people who have got, in Estonia and Latvia, a passport which is called an Alien’s Passport. They submitted a petition 18 months ago. In this report, one big political group made this petition a red line for them. We have 7% of non-citizens in Estonia and 12% of them in Latvia, and in order not to discuss the topic there were circulating huge amounts of letters containing huge amounts of lies.  The problem for us, for liberals and for me, as a representative of those people, is that we never reached the substance in this discussion. So I will use the opportunity and just say it is not true that these people vote for Putin. They do not vote in any country. They have no voting rights. It is not true that they serve in the Russian Army. They do not serve in any army. It is not true that to get Estonian citizenship they have to speak Estonian at elementary level. They have to speak Estonian B1, which is enough to study at university in any foreign country. So the problem is that we avoided this discussion. In the very beginning, when I came to the European Parliament, I was very happy that we have a really high political culture here but this petition is the thing which I really cannot accept.

I think that the plenary will vote on the report today in such a way that the report will be tidy again, also in your interests, so that your 99%, where you have done a good job, will then also be in the minutes. Point three, responsibilities: we should have the courage in the Petitions Committee to decide on responsibilities more quickly. That is good for the petitioners. My motto is: better a quick bad news than a petition process lasting several years with the same answer. Fourth, abuse: my colleagues will add it. Unfortunately, again this year we have seen a tendency for some groups to actually abuse the Committee on Petitions on certain issues. That also has to do with responsibilities. We in the Petitions Committee are simply not responsible for reparation costs or citizenships. That would be the first clear answer. And fifth, Network: This is the new invention.

This commission, on which I would like to dwell a little bit, although it is non-legislative, is essential for our institution because it ensures a fundamental right, guaranteed by our founding pact - the treaties - which is that of addressing petitions when the right that we, legislators, vote here is not respected or that it calls for adaptations. This right is an essential link with our fellow citizens and civil society and it requires the mobilization of all actors so that petitions are dealt with correctly and with diligence. To this end, we reviewed the working methods of the Committee on Petitions in 2015 and they are working well. I therefore think that we must reject the amendments which would put a straitjacket on our activity and limit this democratic right to petition. If all the institutions must be mobilized - this Parliament, the first - there is one which must adhere to a particular requirement, it is the European Commission, because as guardian of the Treaties, it has the power to open infringement proceedings and to prosecute Member States for infringement, where appropriate, before the Court of Justice.

The second important thing is that we feel that PETI's prestige in front of the citizens has also increased. We experience this during negotiations, during fact-finding visits, and during frequent hearings. This is a very important job with the citizens of the European Union. It is interesting to note that the Brexit negotiations have not yet begun, and we have already received hundreds of petitions concerning the rights of European Union citizens. Thirdly, I would like to ask the European Commission to pay more attention. Sometimes we feel that cooperation is slow.

I would like to comment on one area, that of environment and health, where it was said that this is one area which directly affects our citizens, and I totally agree. In fact, according to Europol and Eurobarometer, environmental standards and legislation are among the main areas of legislation most appreciated and acknowledged by EU citizens. There was also a mention of environmental impact assessments (EIAs) and I would like to comment that, every year, 16 000 EIAs and 34 000 screenings are carried out in the EU 28. In addition, whenever there is a risk of serious irreversible environmental harm and health risks, then the Commission always intervenes proactively.

The issue of German war reparations was also identified there. And 74 years after the Holocaust, the massacre of Kalavrita, which took place on December 13, 1943, the European Union must give a serious answer and the serious answer is firstly that we do not forget, secondly that there is a serious issue called \"German war reparations \"and concern Greece, concern Poland, possibly other countries, and this issue is not going to be closed. It is not going to end with a trick, or with amendments, or anything. I have put this up many times and I will continue to put it up and I tell you here: In the coming days I will submit a report on the issue of German compensation, so that I can see how you will handle it. But it turns out that you do not even want a public debate on this issue, because for four years you have been constantly rejecting my personal proposals for a public hearing, a public debate by the Committee on Petitions on the issue of German reparations and you are constantly rejecting it, the European People's Party , the Socialist Group and the Liberals. Why; What were you afraid of from the public debate and the public hearing? So I believe that this issue will always be relevant, because with tricks, with amendments, the historical memory is not erased.

What we are doing in this report is to give, as a Parliament, our reaction to the White Paper that the Commission has published on the future of low—emission mobility, which is a good start by the Commission, but in the end was very general on many issues, whereas in this report we are trying to become more concrete. Looking at all the different sectors, what does it mean if you implement Paris? The first important message is that the transport sector should be close to zero emissions by mid—century, which means that the Commission White Paper, looking at the future of transport, needs to be updated, and Parliament is also clearly asking for that. But of course it also means sectoral activity.  I think that there will be a lot about cars in the debate. As always, in the Parliament we love to debate about cars. I just want to warn my colleagues that there is much more in the report than just that. What the car and the future of cars mean for CO2 emissions and for a mandate on zero-emission vehicles will of course be discussed. The report makes some statements on this, but the legislative proposal that the Commission put forward at the beginning of this month on CO2 limits in cars is going to be the legislative work on that. What we further do in this report is to shine some light on all the different sectors and come up with different proposals, but one more overarching and important message that this report gives is that we have to get the pricing right. If we just look at the different modes of transport, we see that the different ways of pricing are unevenly distributed. One that springs to mind is the aviation sector. There too we know that, preferably, we will need global action, but it is also very important to realise that, in the end, European action also stimulates action at global level, as was happening at ICAO. That is also very clear. If Europe had not taken its step on ETS a couple of years ago, there would not have been a global deal in ICAO two years ago. I think that is also an important message.  The report does, of course, go further into infrastructural challenges and issues around logistics and digitalisation, looking at how these future technologies will provide options and opportunities. I think it is very important that the report also goes into the economic opportunities. If you go to a low—emission mobility transport, there are also opportunities for new sectors to thrive and to have future jobs. I think that is a very important message in this report as well. There will be some tight votes, I know that.  I want thank my shadow rapporteurs for their great work on it – I can see them all in this room – and I would also would like to thank Mr Zoffoli from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI), who also actively contributed to the report with contributions from the ENVI Committee, bringing together a strong report. I hope this Parliament will send a strong message to the Commission to come forward with more legislative action to make sure that we will have near zero—emission transport by mid-century.

Greenhouse gas emissions from transport represent a quarter of total emissions, are constantly increasing and are the main cause of air pollution. The opinion of the ENVI commission, of which I was rapporteur, which was incorporated in full in the report in question, examines the emissions of all the main means of transport: cars and vans, heavy vehicles, airplanes, ships, in addition to the topic of overcoming first generation biofuels by 2030, taking into account indirect land use change and encouraging a broad market penetration of those advanced fuels that respect the principle of the waste hierarchy and strong sustainability criteria. In the case of cars and vans, ambitious CO2 targets are being asked for 2025 and to develop a road test to calculate real emissions. For heavy vehicles, an important novelty: after years of useless discussions, finally by 2018 we will have a regulation for the monitoring, certification and publication of data on emissions and consumption of heavy vehicles, and to follow a proposal for emission limits same. The Commission is also invited to adopt an ambitious action plan for placing electric vehicles on the market. Finally, we ask for a coordinated homologation and market surveillance system at EU level to overcome the shortcomings highlighted by the \"dieselgate\", reducing the compliance factor for nitrogen oxide emissions to 1 by 2021.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 25, "date": "2017-12-14.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you for the invitation to discuss our European Strategy for Low-Emission Mobility. The Commission warmly welcomes Parliament’s report and I would personally like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bas Eickhout, and the shadow rapporteurs for their work on this report. As highlighted in President Juncker’s State of the Union address in September, we should strive to become the world leader in the fight against climate change. The transition to a modern and low-carbon economy is a key political priority for the Commission. We need to address this challenge of climate change and at the same time, we must strive to extend the competitive edge of our industries, generate sustainable economic growth and jobs, and drive innovation in clean technologies. Transport is responsible for almost a quarter of Europe’s greenhouse gas emissions and contributes significantly to air pollution. If we were to do nothing, the sector would become the largest emitter of CO2 emissions after 2030. Low-emission mobility is therefore absolutely essential to meet our commitments under the COP 21 Paris Agreement and also to meet the 2030 energy and climate goals we agreed on. A well-defined EU strategy for the transport sector is essential, and it must cover all three core areas: first, higher efficiency of the transport system; second, low-emission alternative energy for transport; and third, low and zero-emission vehicles. By making our transport network more efficient, we can reduce the energy consumed, cut journey times and better serve the end user. There is a massive potential to make this happen by encouraging multimodal transport solutions and digitalisation.  We have already adopted in the past months a series of measures to foster the attractiveness of the most environmentally friendly modes of transport, specifically railways and inland navigation. The Commission also proposed recently additional measures to avoid empty runs in road freight operations, as well as in favour of combined transport and public transport by buses and coaches. We count on Parliament to support those initiatives. On alternative energy however, it is not just about transport efficiency. The second area we are tackling is that of energy. Promoting alternative energy sources for transport is essential. At present, 94% of transport energy is still derived from oil. This means high emissions and dependency on imports. To speed up the transition to alternative energy, the Commission has proposed recasting the Renewable Energy Directive. We have a clear expectation that the proposed gradual reduction of conventional crop-based biofuels and increase of advanced biofuels will promote the development and deployment of innovative advanced renewable fuels.  We are also actively supporting the deployment of alternative fuel infrastructures, such as recharging stations for electric cars, with financial support, consumer information and standardisation activities. To stimulate electro mobility, it is crucial to ensure the interoperability of electric vehicle charging. Recharging an electric vehicle should be as easy as refuelling a conventional car. With regards to zero and low-emission vehicles, which brings me to the third area, EU fuel efficiency standards for cars and vans have proven to be a strong driver for innovation and efficiency in vehicles. But emissions need to be reduced even further. This is why the Commission proposed, as part of its second mobility package, ambitious and realistic CO2 emission targets for cars and vans, while incentivising the further deployment of zero and low-emission vehicles. We also proposed additional measures to speed up market uptake and to accompany public authorities’ efforts in this respect.  Action is also needed to reduce emissions from heavy duty vehicles and this will be proposed next year by the Commission in its third mobility package. Let me conclude: only together can we make the implementation of this strategy a success. With the Clean Energy for all Europeans package, the Europe on the Move package and the Clean Mobility package, the Commission has already put forward proposals covering a large part of the action agenda of this strategy. We now very much count on your continued constructive support to the low-emissions strategy and the various initiatives that flow from it. I am looking forward to our discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 26, "date": "2017-12-14.json", "name": "Massimiliano SALINI", "mepid": "125670", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank the rapporteur for the work he has done. It was a work that allowed all of us to deepen one of the most crucial, most decisive issues for the effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, COP21, but it was also a very frank work, in which some differences were highlighted . On these we have identified a method to reach the goal that interests everyone, that is to ensure that, even if starting from different cultural positions, COP21 does not remain a theoretical objective on paper. And unfortunately the analysis made also in his initial speech by the rapporteur is correct when he says that the Commission at COP21 has added messages that are sometimes too theoretical. Here, to give substance to all this, however, we cannot think that this concreteness depends on equally theoretical targets, we cannot think of inserting targets left and right, under the illusion that this is the way to attribute concreteness to COP21. We have to answer a fundamental question: transport is a central point for this question to be answered. We have emerging countries in which there is a growing demand for energy: India, at this moment, has implemented a policy that by 2040 will bring enormous investments in nuclear and renewables. But despite this, by 2040 India will still have 60 percent of its energy produced through coal. And today there are 400 million people in India who have no energy. So, no targets are made in Europe on electric cars to solve the problem that has not been solved by COP21. It is a global policy implemented within the WTO, in which we are given the opportunity to allow emerging economies to implement a development policy that responds to their energy demand through renewable, sustainable sources.

The solutions proposed by Mr Eickhout are largely a \"paper tiger\" - at first glance impressive with their panache and certainly full of good intentions, but extremely difficult to implement quickly and effectively throughout the European Union, not only in some of the richest countries . In many cases, the price of an overly ambitious and hastily implemented low-emission transport policy will be paid by consumers in the costs of train or plane tickets, in expenses for the operation of private cars or in the price of every product that is brought to our neighborhood stores every day. For many companies that will have to replace their entire fleets of vehicles in order to meet restrictive climate standards, this can mean difficult costs to bear. It may even mean the end of their activities. The ECR Group cannot endorse a report that takes such little account of the financial implications of the proposed solutions.

If we do nothing, our mobility will become the largest source of greenhouse gas after 2030. It is therefore time for action, because we need to reduce emissions in Europe. Bas Eickhout's present report is balanced and ambitious, and it calls for action. Action to prevent new cars that emit CO2 from entering the European market after 2035. Action to roll out alternative fuels infrastructure across Europe. But also action to very consistently implement the principle that the user, the polluter pays, in transport, for road transport, but certainly also for other modalities such as aviation. Above all, let us all ensure that there is fair competition between the different modes of transport. This also means that the European Commission must go on an international trip to see what we can do about the exemption from VAT on airline tickets. Or what we can do to eventually just introduce excise duties on kerosene. Because why should I today have to pay VAT on a ticket for the train between Amsterdam and Paris, while I absolutely do not have to pay VAT for the same flight ticket between those two places? It simply cannot be explained to our citizens any longer simply because it is not fair. Consumers must be able to make a proper assessment based on a fair price. So, as a liberal, I fully agree that we are going to use price incentives to achieve sustainability. And, Mr President, that VAT exemption, but also the fact that there are no excise duties on kerosene, that is really just an example of something that we must tackle, precisely to bring about a turnaround.

But what have we been up to since? The numbers don't lie, alas! From 1990 to 2015, transport emissions increased by 16%. Since 2015, this is the only sector that is still growing. Transport accounts for 25% of greenhouse gases in Europe, including 70% for road transport. Air pollution causes 400,000 premature deaths in Europe every year. It leads to healthcare costs ranging from 330 to 940 billion euros per year. But we have to do something to change that. It is now!

This is where we have to be firm and we have a good track record with Mr Eickhout's report. Let’s stop funding diesel research, even the boss of Volkswagen is now saying so. Ditto for aviation: let's finally tax kerosene, stop this discounted VAT for tickets. On the contrary, let's put in place the “polluter pays” principle, particularly in road transport, by basing charges on distance and no longer on time. Let us set mandatory quotas for the production of clean vehicles for vehicle manufacturers rather than encourage them to do so.

We are careful, however, so that the ambitious timelines within which to achieve all this can really materialize. It is also necessary to set intermediate steps in the short and medium term to be able to reach the 2020 and 2035 objectives. The indication to promote green public procurement is also good. Let us not forget, however, that the real transition to sustainable sources must consider both the direct and indirect aspects of using an energy source. For this reason, it would be much better to diversify sustainable mobility solutions, rather than focusing only on electric.

This is a very detailed report that shows all facets of transport and the potential for decarbonization. With this in mind: Many thanks to the rapporteur, Bas Eickhout, and to our shadow rapporteur, Mrs Graswander-Hainz. It is undisputed that traffic and transport in general must become cleaner, and it is not a contradiction in terms that on the one hand we can achieve the ecological goals, but on the other hand not only preserve the industrial base with its many hundreds of thousands of jobs, but also can also expand. However, this requires a coherent medium to long-term strategy. Mobility is a complex system in which each subsystem has its own functional logic. Urban traffic, for example, works differently from long-distance traffic, and car traffic works differently from truck traffic, air traffic or even shipping. In order to reduce emissions above all, we have to start in the cities, i.e. in urban traffic. Public transport and bicycles must become more attractive as a result, and we must also promote car sharing offers. Of course, digitization also brings great opportunities. In my opinion, digitization, digital applications and digital networking also offer a great opportunity for decarbonization. What do we do on the long haul? Long-haul transport - as we have repeatedly agreed in the European Parliament and put on paper with the Commission and the Council - must be shifted to rail. I would like to remind you again of the various white papers that have taken up this. If we are to succeed in this, the railways, in other words the railways, must also become more attractive, and they must be relieved of their tax burden. It must also be used throughout Europe in the infrastructure to be invested.And when we talk about infrastructure - Commissioner, you mentioned it - of course, alternative drive systems and alternative fuels need to be expanded.But I am surprised - let me say this again - that the Commission only came up with a communication in the mobility package and not with legislation.Either way, the report is good, it should be approved.Having said this, colleagues, dear President: I wish all of you Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 35, "date": "2017-12-14.json", "name": "Peter van DALEN", "mepid": "96809", "text": "- A steward is given control over something and must perform that task in a valuable and future-proof manner. To me, man is the steward of this creation and that responsibility requires us to combat the emission of pollutants, also in the transport sector. This is well described in Mr Eickhout's report and I will briefly focus on two good points and one less strong point. One, air traffic is a very polluting mode of transport and the colleague rightly calls attention to the pricing of kerosene and airline tickets. This is really necessary to continue the cleaner world, also in aviation. Second, freight traffic must also make the switch to cleaner and better, less polluting and sustainable, and that means plenty of room for innovation. So I am very pleased that paragraph 93 of the report makes a clear case for the Ecocombi. Fortunately, because the Ecocombi takes away a lot of kilometers that are made by smaller trucks. That is why it is great that the Ecocombi is featured so prominently. Three, as far as the railway paragraph is concerned, I find it very ideological. The many millions who went to rail for the modal shift have simply not worked. You can see that the modal shift of the railway did not materialize in the end. We need to look at more creative ideas, for example more connections between inland shipping and road transport. But in general, thanks to the rapporteur.

With all the strengths of the battery-electric drive, we shouldn't prematurely stifle all other innovations. Second, this strategy must not only be for city dwellers.

We are now discussing how to change Europe's transport system in order to achieve a low-emission transport system, which is crucial if we are to be able to keep our promises from Paris. And then I want to highlight three proposals. The first proposal: distance-based charges for road freight transport. We must apply the market economy idea polluter pays. It is the person causing the problem who will pay for the solution of the problem. And then it must become more profitable to move freight traffic from roads to the train, and then the trucks will have to pay for their climate costs. It must also be the case that through tolls, it contributes to innovation and efficiency on the roads, because at present it is the case that our roads are filled with half-empty trucks. If we move more traffic from roads to trains, it will create space for those who actually have to use the roads in the future. Two: aviation has to pay for its climate impact. It is unreasonable for aviation to be able to escape the climate bill. Although it is good that the EU is now taking steps forward to start including aviation in the EU's emissions trading, we are still far from having aviation pay its full climate bill. We must include flights to and from airports outside Europe. We must also include the so-called the high altitude effects. This is because it affects the climate more when aircraft emit climate-damaging gases up in the air than down on the ground, but despite this, it is not included in the system at present. That's unreasonable. Three: major investments in sustainable infrastructure. For my two previous proposals, this means increased tax revenues that we can then use for massive investments in infrastructure. But if we are to meet our climate goals, from now on, all investments must go in a sustainable direction. This means more public transport, more railways, more high-speed trains and night trains. If we do this, we will make it easier for people in the future to do what is easy, cheap and smart for the climate.We Greens will fight for that.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 39, "date": "2017-12-14.json", "name": "Jill SEYMOUR", "mepid": "124950", "text": "   – Mr President, this report is all well and good if it continues to allow citizens the freedom to choose how they travel. It was after the 1997 Kyoto Agreement that our Chancellor, Gordon Brown, announced in 1998 that diesel cars should attract less vehicle tax than their petrol equivalent because of their better CO2 performance. Then in 2001 Mr Brown reduced vehicle tax on cars with low CO2. This was a major change to encourage the public to buy diesel cars. Yet now we are increasingly seeing dramatic change to what forms of transport we are to use.  The report also seeks to comprehensively reduce the attractiveness of private forms of transport. In other words, the EU is driving us out of our cars. In a nutshell: user pays, polluter pays. As regards ‘polluter pays’, what I do find positive is a move towards zero emissions based on consumer choice, and I stress consumer choice. What I do not find helpful is knee-jerk solutions that punish the driver before any proper infrastructure is in place.  Certainly, after watching the grand tour this weekend, it is clear that EVs are becoming more efficient and user-friendly, but many citizens do not have the financial capabilities to change their cars, and this needs to be addressed.  Just as citizens need time to prepare, so does the manufacturing industry. They still have forecourts full of petrol and diesel cars. Encouraging the development of hybrids will help aid the transition. UK-based Jaguar Landrover is one company, like others, who recognised the need to change and should be commended on their projects. They are reducing NOX and particles which are harmful. It is also wrong for the EU to force a change through financial penalties, dividing those who can afford and those who cannot.  While some parts of this report are moving in the right direction, it will be up to the UK Government – and it alone – to set the standards once we gain our independence in 2019. I finally leave my Christmas message to you all. The UK referendum ballot paper asked: Should the United Kingdom remain a Member of the European Union or leave the European Union?

Rather, we need a technology-neutral approach that takes the entire footprint into account. Anyone who believes that only electric vehicles are zero-emission vehicles should ask themselves where the energy for them comes from and how they and their batteries are manufactured or disposed of. For me, setting a minimum number for the proportion of electric vehicles is disproportionate. Above all, we should refrain from penalizing certain modes of transport, because every mode of transport has its place, especially in intermodal transport. Basically, I do not believe in punishment, because it is more productive to create incentives for energy and environmentally friendly measures.

Why do we waste our taxpayers' time and money today on wishful thinking and rather unrealistic goals?

We are talking about a design framework in which we provide legal framework conditions for new technical developments, open to technology, with companies, with citizens. The Greens and the Left do not want to shape. They want to ban and educate. You speak of a prohibition framework, quotas, cost savings and blinkers when choosing technology.

This is why I will focus on one dimension that seems essential to me: the application of the \"polluter pays\" and \"user pays\" principles. Transport generates pollution, it is a fact, and even if we can try to reduce it, it will never be zero. Transport will always require ad hoc infrastructure, especially as vehicles are increasingly sophisticated. However, we can try to reduce pollution at the source, but for this to be done effectively, we need a minimum binding target for manufacturers, otherwise it will remain wishful thinking. It will also be beneficial for the competitiveness of the European automotive industry, as it will remain at the forefront of technological innovation. In addition, it appears essential to finance the infrastructures and the negative effects, known as “external costs”, by those who use them.

The transport sector has to contribute its share of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There is no doubt about that. The process to the low-emission strategy will also contribute to making our industry stronger and more competitive, and it will help clean up the environment for citizens and improve their quality of life through better air quality in cities and reducing congestion.  I agree with the point raised about urgency. Yes, we need to act, and we need to act now. We have already initiated a series of initiatives to support the move to lower emissions. Member States and local authorities, educational and research institutes, as well as producers and investors can all provide much-needed incentives.  One of the comments referred to the Commission’s approach to alternative fuels as only a communication and not as a legislative proposal. As specified in Directive 2014/94 on the deployment of alternative fuels, by the end of 2018 the Commission will present an action plan on alternative fuels infrastructures. We presented this action plan in November of this year. Regarding a legislative proposal amending the directive, this is foreseen for before the end of 2020 if the Commission considers the need for it.  A number of speakers also mentioned the importance of addressing aviation and the maritime transport sector. In order to effectively address emissions from international sectors, such as aviation and maritime, global solutions are needed. The EU is fully committed and strongly contributing to the ongoing processes for reaching effective and ambitious measures within the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) and the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). For the Commission, this is a priority.  There was also a mention ofthe need for horizontal initiatives or horizontal enablers, and I can refer to a number of initiatives that are in place which should strengthen the impact of the steps outlined above. For instance, advancing the electromobility update by encouraging consumers to charge batteries at off-peak times through new rules for electricity market design. In addition, there are preparations for an EU strategy on research, innovation and competitiveness that should bring together energy technologies, transport and industry and facilitate the development of energy storage solutions, such as the next generation batteries, and focus more on research into advanced bio and synthetic fuels.  Rules for a Digital Single Market should set standards for using digital technologies in transport and ensure free flow of data. The shift, as already mentioned by Mr Eickhout, to low-emission mobility will also have an impact on jobs in the transport sector, which currently account for 15 million or 7% of EU jobs, by requiring new skills. This challenge has been taken up in the New Skills Agenda for Europe. This strategy therefore aims to develop a horizontal enablers’ programme as well, in order to create the right framework conditions for innovation and investment in the low-emissions sector.  I would like once again to thank the European Parliament for this constructive cooperation on this file. I would also once again like to thank Mr Eickhout and the shadow rapporteurs. We all look forward to a positive vote.

One thing that is striking is that some of my colleagues read ‘prohibition’ in this report and they read that we are favouring one certain technology specifically. I would like to ask them where they read that. When we are putting a mandate on zero—emission vehicles it is probably you who then reads ‘electric cars’. Maybe that says something about your obsession rather than what is in the report, because it is just a mandate on zero—emission vehicles. Anything that can comply with that will deliver. It does not say ‘electric cars’. Point out to me where ‘electric cars’ is explicitly mentioned. I think it is a bit of a preoccupation with some of my colleagues that they read ‘electric cars’ everywhere, as if that is the biggest enemy.  I think, in the end, we have to clean up our air, we have to lower emissions and it is possible. I really want to stress that it is possible and, if we do it in time, it will make sure that the jobs we have will remain in Europe. If we do not do it, the rest of the world will move ahead and we will start importing their techniques instead of producing them ourselves. I think that what the Brits would say is ‘penny wise, pound foolish’. I would like to stress that we really have to be careful not to make that mistake.  For the rest, I really would like to thank everyone for the cooperation. I am looking forward to the vote. I would like to say thank you very much to the Commission, but you say we have all the proposals on the table, though you also know very well that some of these proposals are not so ambitious at all. In the end, Paris implementation also requires the Commission to come forward with proposals that really deliver on that, and I therefore plead to my colleagues not only to accept this report, setting nice targets, but when we are talking about legislative proposals that we also really will make sure that they will deliver on what is needed to implement Paris.

An example is the article which seeks to introduce a minimum target for manufacturers for the share of zero-emission cars. I believe that mandatory regulation is an excessive interference in the economy, in the business decisions of economic operators. Moreover, for some players, the regulation could be a significant disadvantage in international competition. Without such measures, incentive competition between manufacturers is expected to emerge, as there are now examples. Another point is the introduction of distance-based charging for passenger cars. The Commission material also makes reference to this.

The EU has been constructively engaged with the Vietnamese authorities on a revision of the penal code and its related laws, in order to ensure alignment with international standards by providing input to the National Assembly, by offering exchange of best practices, and by promoting joint actions with like-minded countries. Political and civil rights, as well as legal and judicial reform, are regularly raised at the Human Rights Dialogue with Vietnam.  During the last session, which took place on 1 December 2017 in Hanoi, the EU reiterated its request for all Vietnamese citizens detained for peacefully exercising their freedom of expression to be released. In this context, the EU also referred to a number of individual cases. Furthermore, the EU stressed that the negative trend in freedom of expression needs to be reversed, especially at a time when Vietnam and the EU are committed to working towards a closer relationship. The case of Mr Nguyen Van Hoa is a clear example of the deterioration in civil and political rights in Vietnam in recent months. The extensive application of national security provisions in Vietnam’s penal code has resulted in a steep rise in the arrest, detention and sentencing of Vietnamese citizens who peacefully express their opinions. Compared to 20 years ago, reform and modernisation have allowed Vietnam to make continuous progress in economic and social rights, steadily reaching out to international processes. The EU and Vietnam are partners in moving from limited regional integration to meeting wider international standards.

Therefore, the European Parliament is again discussing the situation in Cambodia, notably the banning of the opposition.  The dissolution of the Cambodia National Rescue Party and the worsening climate for opposition politicians raises serious concerns, as well as the strong influence of China in the political life of Cambodia, which is playing an important role in political decisions in that country.  We welcome the EU decision to withdraw all electoral assistance until Cambodia engages in reforms, in line with international electoral standards, in order to advance democracy and protect civil society space. It is important to underline that respect for fundamental human rights is a prerequisite for Cambodia to continue to benefit from the EU’s preferential Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme. If Cambodia is acting in violation of its obligations under the EBA regulation, the tariff preferences it currently enjoys must be temporarily withdrawn.  We urge the Cambodian Government to reverse the decision to dissolve the opposition party, restore the elected members of the parliament and commune council to their position, and to allow the full participation of opposition parties in public life. In the event of a failure to guarantee political and social rights in the country, further steps in the form of sanctions might be taken by the European Union, such as an introduction of a list of individuals responsible for the dissolution of the opposition and other serious human rights violations in Cambodia, with a view to imposing possible visa restrictions and asset freezes on them.  Finally, I call on High Representative Ms Mogherini and the EU Special Representative for Human Rights to use all means available to protect the fundamental rights of the Cambodian people to elect and be elected, and to guarantee pluralism and democratic principles strictly in line with Cambodia’s Constitution.

Cambodia is heading towards increasing authoritarianism. In recent months, the Cambodian Government has taken action to stifle political opposition, to suffocate democracy. We have underlined that the decision of the Cambodian Government on 16 November to dissolve the main opposition party, the Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP), is a significant step away from the path of pluralism and democracy enshrined in Cambodia’s Constitution and supported for more than two decades by Cambodia’s international partners, including the European Union. We reiterate that an electoral process from which the main opposition party has been arbitrarily excluded is not legitimate. The CNRP won one over 43% of the vote at the 2016 commune elections and 44.5% in the 2013 legislative elections. Its dissolution disenfranchises is those voters.  The 1991 Paris Accords created binding legal obligations upon the parties, including the duty of the Cambodian Government to maintain liberal multi—party democracy, as well as to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. These commitments are enshrined in the Cambodian Constitution. The European Union and its Member States have put, and continue to put, huge efforts and very significant resources into supporting the development of Cambodia. It is therefore very worrying to see over the last months a significant narrowing of the democratic space in the country.  On 20 November, High Representative Mogherini met with the Cambodian Foreign Minister, Prak Sokhonn, on the margins of the ASEM Ministerial Meeting in Myanmar. She insisted on the expectation that the continued detention of the opposition leader, Kem Sokha, and the dissolution of the CNRP would be swiftly reversed. The High Representative also recalled that the EU’s development cooperation and trade preferences were reliant on Cambodia’s respect for fundamental human rights. We are currently assessing the situation in terms of development cooperation assistance. In this regard, the EU has decided to suspend its support to the national election committee. The EU will continue to reaffirm its commitment to protect and to promote the universality of human rights whenever they are violated or questioned, whether inside or outside its borders.  The principle of democratic inclusion and dialogue is key to lasting peace and stability. We encourage the Cambodian Government to find a way out of this impasse, through a structured dialogue with the opposition. We will also continue to raise with the government the need to apply the law evenly and fairly to all, and the need to ensure that freedom of association, expression and due process are fully respected.  Respect for fundamental human and labour rights is also part of our trade policy and underpins the legal basis of our trade preferences. Our development cooperation with Cambodia is long term and any consideration regarding a suspension of cooperation would have to be carefully evaluated in terms of its impact. Suspension of aid could be detrimental to the population.

Gender-based violence is a major problem in El Salvador, where a woman is sexually assaulted every three hours and rape and incest often result in unwanted pregnancies. Since 1998, abortion has been criminalised in all circumstances, even when continuing the pregnancy is life-threatening or when the foetus is non-viable.

Today we are talking about El Salvador, a small Central American country where relatively recently, in 1998, a total ban on abortion was introduced into law. It means that even a woman who is raped or whose pregnancy is life-threatening cannot terminate her pregnancy. It is a very cruel law that treats women objectively and contemptuously, and which in El Salvador is further interpreted in a way that ignores the principles of justice, the presumption of innocence and scientific knowledge. Well, women who experience miscarriage or pregnancy necrosis are accused of abortion or murder of a child and are sentenced to many years in prison. Therefore, pregnancy for a woman in El Salvador is a drama, especially when she is unmarried and is still a child herself. Pregnant girls commit suicide in fear of the consequences. In El Salvador, suicide causes more than half of the deaths in pregnant women between the ages of 10 and 19. Many women die as a result of complications of pregnancy. Any abnormal pregnancy immediately raises suspicions and accusations of attempted abortion or fetal death, so women with difficult pregnancies simply avoid doctors. I appeal to the Salvadoran authorities to stop the inhumane treatment of women, to introduce a law providing for exceptions to the prohibition of abortion and to release from prison women incarcerated there for acts which, in the light of international standards of law and medical knowledge, cannot be treated as crimes. Madam President! I would like to add one more sentence in response to what Mr. Marek Jurek said.

The EU does not comment on judicial decisions but observes with significant concern that on many occasions maximum criminal penalties were applied to women who had a miscarriage in El Salvador. Respect for the rule of law is one of the fundamental values upon which the EU is based. Therefore the EU is very much attached to the presumption of innocence, as well as to upholding the principles of proportionality, due process and the provision of legal aid in all judicial processes. To follow up the situation closely, the EU is in regular contact with local associations, such as citizens’ groups, which provide support to women and girls during their trials. Under the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, the EU has also supported the provision of legal assistance to human rights organisations. The relative scarcity of sexual and reproductive health services in El Salvador is another important obstacle to address the issue of miscarriage. It is also a key area of progress to improve women’s lives in the country. Respect for, and the promotion of, women’s rights is at the core of the EU agenda in El Salvador and beyond. From a human rights angle, the total ban on abortion foreseen in the constitution and criminal code of El Salvador is worrying, especially when the lives of pregnant women or young girls are at risk or in cases of rape. Total bans on abortion are also a problem in several other countries in Latin America.  The EU raises this issue at the highest level in El Salvador and welcomes the efforts deployed by the Government to improve in a comprehensive manner the alarming situation of women. Among other initiatives, the EU has provided support to the flagship and successful programme ‘Ciudad Mujer’ (Women’s City), created by the Government and which has meaningfully contributed to enhancing women’s and girls’ access to sexual and reproductive health services, but also to address gender-based violence, as well as to promote women’s economic empowerment.  The EU encourages El Salvador and all other countries concerned by this important challenge to continue pursuing efforts in this direction and stands ready to help on this issue.

Therefore, I believe that we, the European Parliament, the Commission, the national authorities need to see what citizens are complaining about in the functioning of the internal market and call for the implementation of a fair market.

However, I voted against it for purely political reasons, to protest, as, as I mentioned in my speeches in the morning, in my initial report there was in paragraph 16 my explicit reference to the issue of German compensation that Germany owes to Greece. However, following an amendment by the European People's Party, the Socialist Group and the Liberals, the original paragraph 16 on German reparations was deleted, as was the corresponding reference in the explanatory memorandum. In the end, however, despite the efforts of these political groups, another explicit reference to the German war reparations that Germany owed to Greece remained in another part of the explanatory memorandum. So for the first time in a document of the European Union, which even bears my name, reference is made to German compensation. It is a first beginning and we will continue even stronger in 2018.

I agree entirely with these priorities so I was proud to vote for the report.  In addition, it was good that the amendment to the report, seeking to promote incentives to use mega trucks, was defeated as these are dangerous and unnecessary. However, it was disappointing that the point in the report on phasing out new emitting cars by 2035 was not approved. The European automotive industry must adapt much faster to mobility transition.

But, again, we have to be careful about greenwashing. With those who use the fight against climate change to wash their image. The use of misnamed natural gas and some biofuels does not represent an adequate solution at all. These fuels only perpetuate the extractivist model and anchor us to a global model with excessive need or dependence on transport.
