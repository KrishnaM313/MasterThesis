Regarding the Climate Action Summit, the Commission adopted on 11 September a Communication to the European Parliament and the Council in preparation for the Summit, to present the European Union’s impressive track record on climate policy and our commitment to accelerated climate ambition. The high attendance of European Union leaders at the Summit – including the President of the European Council Donald Tusk – will enable the European Union to recall and explain comprehensively and coherently where Europe stands today and where it wants to go. The European story is one of ambition, real action, unity and determination, and yet one that recognises the richness of approaches applied by the individual Member States and adds value to them. The European Union narrative for the Summit will build on the following elements. First, the solid progress made on the preparation and finalisation of our long-term strategy for climate neutrality by 2050. Second, the over-delivery of our nationally determined contribution (NDC) through a comprehensive body of detailed laws and measures. And third, the planning and organisation to monitor and review the actual implementation and the continuing adequacy of our goals and targets. Last June a large majority of European leaders supported the Commission proposals to make Europe climate neutral by 2050 – a project that means radical transformation of our economy and our society. This is exceptional progress, considering the scale of the challenge. The European Union has been increasing its climate ambition since 1990 and will continue to do so. The European Union reduced its emissions by 22% between 1990 and 2017, while our GDP grew by 58%. Full implementation of our new 2030 legislation, adopted with very large support in Parliament and the Council, would yield another 23% reduction between 2018 and 2030: twice as fast. The adoption of a 2050 objective, together with the governance mechanisms that we have put in place, will ensure that we will continue this acceleration, on a fast track but in a gradual and manageable manner, towards climate neutrality. When fully implemented, we estimate that the measures for 2030 will enable the European Union to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 45% compared to 1990 levels, which goes further than the European Union’s stated objective in its nationally determined contribution, to cut emissions by at least 40% by 2030. Delivering on the 2030 targets will have benefits well beyond 2030. It will ensure the European Union is also going in the right direction towards 2050. At the same time, the European Union is already using its budget to ensure that investments are aligned and actively contributing to the climate goals – we have a 20% climate mainstreaming target in the current European Union budget, amounting to around EUR 200 billion of funds over the 2014-2020 period to support the low carbon transition. In the multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027 that is being discussed in Parliament and in the Council, the Commission has proposed that 25% of the whole budget, or an expected EUR 320 billion, will be specifically climate-relevant, and the rest will be compatible with our climate objectives. The climate and energy transition towards climate neutrality begins with a massive investment challenge, one that we must meet already in the coming years: investment in a clean energy system; in clean industry and clean mobility; in maintaining and restoring our land, to make sure that it not only continues to provide us with food, feed and fibres, but also helps us absorb the greenhouse gas emissions we will not be able to eliminate. We know, of course, that the scale of this investment is beyond the capacity of the public sector alone, and that the private sector will have a major role to play. To attract enough private investment, the European Union is already putting in place the conditions and incentives for investors to fund projects aligned with the climate goals, such as the European Union Action Plan on financing sustainable growth and the associated legislative package. We must focus on adaptation and resilience as well, and on disaster risk reduction, both in Europe and elsewhere. To do this, we will be able to build on the work done under the European Union’s Adaptation Strategy and on our international cooperation efforts in supporting our partner countries.  To this end, the European Union is stepping up its outreach and cooperation, financial and technical, to all partner countries. Nationally determined contributions will be at the core of our support, especially in critical sectors such as renewable energy and energy efficiency, urban development or agriculture and forests. Not only is the European Union the world’s leading donor of development assistance with EUR 74.4 billion in 2018, it is also the world’s largest climate finance donor, providing over 40% of the world’s public climate finance. The European Union and its Member States’ contributions have more than doubled since 2013, exceeding EUR 20 billion annually. The European Union remains fully committed to continuing to scale up the mobilisation of international climate finance, including through enhanced ambition by its investment facilities and the European Investment Bank. Likewise, the European Union’s array of legally binding trade and cooperation agreements will continue to include robust provisions to promote climate action and implement the Paris Agreement. The rapidly changing climate is a global problem and it calls for global responsibility. We in Europe are doing our part. We have acted and we continue to act, but to meet our long-term temperature goals we know we must do more and act faster still. On all this, we have a strong message to communicate at the Summit. We also know that the task does not end here. No matter how much we have done so far, and how much we have strengthened our ambition and speeded up our efforts in these past few years – the years in which I have had the honour of being in charge of climate action and energy policy, and therefore part of this effort – the Summit in New York can only conclude that more is needed. Europe will answer this call to action. Following the elections to the European Parliament and the political guidelines of the President-elect, it is very clear that the European Union will continue to work to raise its ambition further – as always, ‘in a responsible way’ – but with undiminished determination. My expectation is that we will continue to take further bold actions, building on our solid and significant achievements so far, and that we will develop, in a not too distant future, the model for a climate-neutral, modern, competitive and prosperous European economy and society. This must also be a model that our partners in the rest of the world will want to emulate, and that will therefore enable us collectively to avert the climate disasters that would await us otherwise. Let me turn now to the Sustainable Development Goals Summit (SDG Summit). It is of great political importance. It closes the first four-year cycle of the High-Level Political Forum.  The Commission welcomes that heads of state and government will, with all relevant stakeholders, for the first time have the opportunity to review progress in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. The Summit should provide political leadership, guidance and recommendations for acceleration progress towards the Agenda. The SDG Summit should endorse a political declaration that includes a clear call for accelerated action.  The political declaration includes in particular the commitment to: maintain the integrity of the 2030 Agenda and to persevere on the 2020 targets; more concrete language on climate change, including on the synergies between implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement; more concrete language on broader environmental protection including new references to marine ecosystems and sustainable consumption and production. The Commission supports the key messages in the Global Sustainable Development Report, notably: despite significant action underway across the world, the current rate of progress is not adequate to reach the SDGs; some trends even remain negative, including rising inequalities, global warming, biodiversity loss and increasing waste from human activity; and accelerated action is required, as dynamics show that some countries seem to distance themselves from the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement. Let me conclude here by thanking you for your continuing strong support for European Union climate action, which enabled us to tell this positive story on the international stage and to encourage our international partners to enhance global climate ambition and real action. This is what our citizens expect from all of us, including the young generation that is mobilising all over Europe and the rest of the world for a better future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 4, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  Thank you, Commissioner, for your intervention and for the information you have given us about the message that the Commission intends to send at the important New York summit.

The best we can do in this Chamber this morning is bring a speech and a commitment to honour commitments that Europe has signed up to, but also to acknowledge that though we speak well, we don’t always deliver. I am very conscious when I start with the Sustainable Development Goals that there are four of them, in particular, where we are actually going backwards, for example, Sustainable Development Goal 2 on hunger. We were making great progress, but as the FAO have pointed out, we are now going backwards and over 820 million people don’t have enough to eat. There is rising inequality, Commissioner, as you have just stated, so Goal 10 is not being met. On biodiversity and climate, we are also not doing or putting into place actions which will allow us to meet these objectives.  Let me just mention again – on the hunger issue, because it is a very real problem and a challenge for us all to have policy coherence both in Europe and, indeed, globally – the Lancet report, which many of us are familiar with, talked about sustainable intensification. I think even in this House we do not have a consensus as to what that might look like, or how that might evolve, so we do need to have deeper discussions in this Parliament between committees on these issues. One of the things that I hope for is that the new Parliament, which is now in session, will allow for greater coordination between committees.  On climate, we know that there are huge problems looming, and the younger generation are pushing us really forward to do more, but we also have to challenge ourselves and the younger generation to make sure we are ready for the changes in consumption and production patterns that will be required to meet all of these very noble but attainable objectives.  Just to mention two issues again – on oceans and on land. We have strong policies in Europe. We need to impress upon our colleagues in the UN next week that multilateralism is vital. The tragedy is that it’s now weaker than it was when it we signed up to these goals. I hope our delegation will impress that it is working together, both within Europe and the rest of the world, so that we will make our greatest change and I certainly, as one of the leaders of the delegation, will stress that very objective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Miriam DALLI", "mepid": "124970", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, timing is everything and the Climate Action Summit and the Sustainable Development Goals Summit are critical in helping us address the global climate emergency we are facing. The European Union needs to agree on a climate plan that provides an overall level of ambition, ensuring that the required transition takes place and providing the necessary financial means, together with the horizontal policies that need to be set. As things stand today, even if all the 2030 pledges were to be fully implemented, we would not be on track to achieve the Paris Agreement targets. The European Union has the potential and the duty to act ambitiously before 2030 and to adopt and implement a vision for a future climate-neutral and fossil-fuel-free environment. We require clear decarbonisation strategies by different sectors. We require action plans that clearly show how these strategies will be achieved and how they will be financed. They will require changes in sectors like transport, building, industry, agriculture and forestry. Climate change is a global challenge and solutions need to be global too, as the Commissioner himself indicated. But the European Union needs to continue in its leadership role, whilst providing support to the most vulnerable countries that are mostly affected by climate change. We need collective action and, as part of Parliament’s delegation to the Summit, I want to hear a strong European voice that is not afraid of putting forward ambitious programmes, because weak commitments would undermine our communities, our industries, our economies, our youth and our children. It is only through EU leadership that we can speed up global action on the Sustainable Development Goals and climate change goals and the EU should not shy away from its responsibilities.

That is why the convening and appeal by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to ensure that next week — the most important week of the United Nations — a Summit on Climate Action and another on the Sustainable Development Goals is absolutely key. Because it does so at a fundamental moment: one year after all the signatory parties to the Paris Agreement submit, they have to submit their national commitments; concrete decarbonisation commitments to prevent this increase in temperature and that by 2050 we will not exceed a degree and a half of increase. Also at a time like this year, when we have seen how climate devastation in the form of drought, fires, floods have been news every day.

This Friday will be the start of a week of action, a week of global action, of many citizens on the streets, and they have been referred to many times already, but they are asking for much more action than the world is taking right now, including Europe.  Commissioner, I know this is probably going to be one of your last plenaries, but to be very honest, you must have noticed that your speaking notes on climate action of Europe have not changed that much over the last two years. They have always referred to the fact that we have a 2030 package in place, that we are trying to get to carbon neutrality but still have not achieved it, and that we’re the only continent achieving something. I don’t think this is the speech that people are asking for. People are asking for more action; people are asking for politicians to listen to science, and we’re not doing that. The science is very clear: we have 10 years. Ten years to make sure that we are preparing for a new economy – and we have to deliver on that. That means that Europe needs to increase its ambition. I think that there is a bit of change with the new Commission potentially, but I think it’s also very important that we do want to know what exactly they are going to say, what exactly are they going to do in that climate law? I think there you have an important role, because if I talk to the people of your DG, I don’t feel that there is this urgency. There will maybe be a climate law and then there will be a long set of deliberations on what to do after that. We expect Europe to increase its ambition to at least -55% next year, before Paris starts.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, next week the Secretary-General of the United Nations is waiting for us in New York to present our plan on how to stop the increase in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020 and reduce them to zero by 2050. The voice of science is united, it is clear and it has sounded an alarm. An alarm that has dominated the youth of Europe and the whole world. The response to the climate emergency therefore requires nothing less than the radical transformation of our economy and society. We have one last chance to implement a regular and fair transition, implementing the 17 sustainable development goals and the political programme of the Paris Agreement that claim – at the same time as tackling climate change – the eradication of poverty and extreme inequalities. The political declaration of the conference explicitly states that we know the world we want and we have a way to go there.

We are missing our goals in the global south because of a lack of resources, and we are far behind in the global north, in many cases because of a lack of political will and decisive action.

This report, which we requested four years ago, together with my friends from the Ocean and Climate platform, promises to be very alarming. Dear friends, in his own way the ocean is burning. Yet for years, climate negotiations have ignored its crucial role in balancing the climate and providing essential services to humanity. Thanks to photosynthesis of plant microorganisms, the ocean provides half of the oxygen in the atmosphere; it is the other lung on the planet. It absorbs a quarter of greenhouse gas emissions. Marine and coastal ecosystems, such as mangroves and coral reefs, provide food security for three billion people. They are a bulwark against the rising ocean and the violence of extreme weather events. The frequency and intensity of cyclones are a consequence of deep ocean warming. Coral death is due to increased temperature, deoxygenation and ocean acidification. And I am concerned about what this new report will tell us. In 2015, we managed to make the voice of the ocean heard at COP 21 in Paris. It has finally become an emerging issue that is mobilising the European Commission, thanks in particular to the work of Commissioner Vella. And Chile has dubbed the next COP 25 the \"Blue COP\". But the good health of the ocean must be one of the objectives of climate negotiations, especially since it is also part of the solution. We need to finance the restoration of marine and coastal ecosystems, reduce emissions from shipping, develop marine energies without destroying habitats, etc. As the world's leading maritime space, Europe has a tremendous responsibility and leadership to take.

I think we have to look very carefully at how the European Union’s institutions are set up to deliver and mainstream those SDGs, which is why I was actually pleasantly surprised by the Commission President-designate’s comments that we need to have the SDGs mainstreamed throughout all directorates-general (DGs) and the responsibility given to the new Commissioners to deliver just that. But, of the three scenarios that were outlined – let me be very clear here – only scenario one, the first scenario, will get us to the position we need to be in. It’s the only realistic scenario to deliver on the targets and to create a sustainable future.

Not least because it will not only be fine words, but that there will also be concrete action. For us Social Democrats, the work on sustainable futures (ecological, social and economic) is the driving force and a driving force for the whole of Europe. We must live up to the Paris Agreement and we must show that this is the major and most important priority for Europe. But the same must also be done globally. It is important that we now bring our Member States together and show concrete action in New York, but that we also show that this means taking both the Paris Agreement and The 2030 Agenda seriously and ensuring that it becomes concrete action. We have a chance now in New York. Let us not neglect it. Europe plays a key role in climate change change. Use that key. Make sure that we become the leading continent and that we show the international community that in Europe we have understood the seriousness and we will take political responsibility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 35, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Jutta PAULUS", "mepid": "197466", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to thank the It is now almost four years after the Paris Agreement, and it has become clear that what we have decided to do, namely to keep the earth heating below two degrees – preferably at 1.5 degrees – is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve, because emissions have simply not fallen in these four years. Now next week in New York the Climate Action Summit will be held and – sorry, Mr Caete, Mr Liese – I do not believe that we are in the fast lane with the European Union and that we are overachieving our objectives; there can be no question of that at all. We have signed this 1.5 degrees, and if we look at what we have set ourselves for now, that is not enough, according to what science tells us, especially after last year's Special Report, which once again highlighted how large our carbon budget really is, that is, what we can still emit in terms of emissions.

Hungary is firmly committed to this work and objective. This is evidenced by our performance so far, that GDP growth is divorced from our remaining carbon emissions.  However, the fight against climate change is not just up to the EU, which account for less than 10% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions.

I will start with some words from Mr Peter Liese. Mr Liese says that sometimes we Europeans criticise ourselves too much, but I think that in New York the European Union, thanks to the efforts of this Parliament or the former Parliament, has a very good story to tell. Our energy legislation was approved in this House with 80%, on average, of the votes cast. Our climate legislation was approved here with more than 78% of the votes cast. There was wide support for the efforts that the Commission had put on the table to deliver ambitious climate policy. And where are we now, what’s the story we can tell in New York? We Europeans have the most ambitious nationally determined contribution (NDC) of all those expressed by the parties to the Climate Convention, reducing our emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared with 1990. But what is most important is that we have all the binding legislation needed to achieve this target and in fact – thanks to Parliament’s ambition – to over—achieve this target, because with the current legislation we will reduce our emissions by 45%. So we have an ambitious target, we have binding legislation, and we have strong governance in the form of integrated national climate action plans. No other party in the world has this. If the government changes in the United States, the policy changes. In the European elections, elections result in different governments every time but the policy remains the same. So we have ambitious commitments, we have strong legislation and we have put on the table a very ambitious climate-neutral study for 2050. In the October Council, 24 Member States endorsed this legislation – there are only four missing at the moment – and I have high expectations that in the December Council this climate neutrality for 2050 will be a reality in the European Union. It will be extremely important: climate neutrality in 2050 is much more ambitious than the pathways of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), because the IPCC says that globally we have to become climate neutral after 2060 and before 2080.  We will become the first major economy to become climate neutral in 2050, and that’s a good story to tell, notably because, in the new Commission, the President-elect has committed to proposing a European Green Deal in the first 100 days of her term, and that will include the first European climate law to enshrine the 2050 climate neutrality target. We have a strong story to tell.  In addition, the President-elect wants to reduce emissions by 50% in 2030 and not by 2055. So we will go to New York with a good story. And we will go too with lots of support for developing countries to be able to implement climate action, because what is important is not that the European Union is the most ambitious it has ever been, and that we are delivering and will deliver on our commitments, but that we are also supporting other people in delivering and are doing outreach to convince the world that it has to work in this direction.  We are the biggest donor of climate finance to developing countries, more than EUR 20 billion every year, so we can be proud of what we have done. We have a lot of ground to cover because we have to work to be world leaders, because if we are world leaders – developing renewables, developing energy efficiency, phasing out fossil fuels and creating growth and jobs in the green economy – then the rest of the world will follow us.  So we have a responsibility because if the European Union does not assume the leadership then nobody will assume it – here, in climate policy or on the Sustainable Development Goals. I am pretty sure that the new Commission will take that responsibility on board and that this Parliament will give the next Commission the same degree of support that they gave to me.  When we made proposals, Parliament improved the proposals. Now with the commitments of the President-elect, I’m also sure that this Parliament will raise the level of ambition. Just two comments. Becoming climate neutral is a revolution, an economic and social revolution, bigger probably than the industrial revolution, because it changes the way you produce energy, changes the way you heat and cool, changes how your industry is going to produce goods and the means whereby we transport ourselves. It’s a revolution. Changing the way our agriculture has to reduce methane emissions and the use of fertilisers is a big revolution and it produces different impacts in different territories. The impacts are asymmetrical, but there must be a fair and just social transition, and for that the Just Transition Fund becomes fundamental. I am extremely happy that the President-elect has declared the Commission will support the people in the regions most affected through a Just Transition Fund. This is fundamental because nobody should be left behind in the big transformation that the European economic and social system must envisage in the next few years. So we will be ambitious on climate policy but we also have to look after our citizens, our people, so that this is a socially just and fair transition. A final very specific word on the comment made by Mr Ferreira. He referred to the impact of trade agreements and to Mercosur in relation to climate policy. I just want to say that the European Union is strongly committed to leveraging its trade policy to promote climate action in partner countries and to project our approach to climate policies and standards. We have delivered on this commitment in all the agreements negotiated in the past year. The Mercosur Association Agreement follows this approach. It has an ambitious, dedicated ‘trade and sustainable development’ chapter, including legally binding commitments related to environmental protection and climate change, and with respect to the Paris Agreement it contains the strongest form of commitment. Each party commits individually to effectively implementing the Paris Climate Agreement, including in respect of the nationally determined contributions. This means that withdrawal from the Paris Agreement or a breach of its commitments will also be a breach of the EU-Mercosur Agreement, and the commitment to effective implementation of the Paris Agreement is particularly meaningful where partners have made a strong nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 47, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "  The debate is over.

The nomination of Christine Lagarde as the first woman to serve in this position, which is itself something historic, is happening fortuitously only a few months after the solemn celebration in this Chamber of the euro’s 20th anniversary. The single currency is, first and foremost, a powerful economic tool. Not only is it the natural and indispensable complement to the single market, but it is also, as President Mario Draghi often recalls in his speeches, the prerequisite for preserving monetary sovereignty in an increasingly global and interconnected world. The euro though is more than a mere economic tool: it is, above all, an ambitious political project. It is the cornerstone of a European Union of peace and prosperity and the indispensable instrument for protecting and supporting the European economic, social and political model – as we face the important transformations of our time. Over the past 20 years – despite the imperfection and incompleteness of European economic governance – the single currency has shown amazing strength and resilience, even when confronted with one of the toughest economic crises in history. In addition to the political determination to maintain its integrity, the commitment by the European Central Bank and its Presidents – within their terms of reference, of course – to preserve the single currency through concrete monetary-policy action has made a fundamental contribution to protecting the euro and hence the well-being of all European citizens. The 76 written answers provided by the candidate, which are attached to the report being voted on today, as well as the intense hearing before the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 4 September, show, I believe, not only Christine Lagarde’s awareness of the task and the challenges ahead but also her suitability to take up the baton from her predecessors and to keep on pursuing this important mission. The large consensus which the candidate obtained in the committee constitutes, I believe, a good basis for the outcome of today’s vote. However, our task does not end here. In accordance with the Treaties and in line with our committee’s work and that of Parliament as a whole, we will keep on monitoring the activity and decisions of the ECB, inter alia through quarterly monetary dialogues, annual reports and written questions from MEPs. As always, we will be demanding. And we will expect an institution that lives up to the fundamental task it is expected to perform. If we want to reach our ambitious objectives, however, the strength and the stability of the euro is not sufficient. We need to add new institutions, new tools and truly European economic policies to monetary-policy measures. It is imperative to pursue an authentic deepening of our economic and monetary union, as was stated too in the programme presented by Commission President-elect Ursula von der Leyen, which includes measures to ensure the full implementation of the social pillar, as well as growth-oriented revision of European economic governance.

Today’s vote on the candidate for the President of the European Central Bank is particularly important as the ECB plays a central role in EU economic policy. The Treaties enshrine the independence of the European Central Bank in its conduct of monetary policy. This is a principle that the Commission defends wholeheartedly as it is crucial for achieving the objective of safeguarding price stability. But independence and accountability go hand in hand. Today’s vote is an important manifestation of the mechanisms by which the ECB is held to account towards the European Parliament. The importance of the debates and the positions expressed by this Parliament are evident from the choice of the Council to propose Christine Lagarde as ECB President. I concur with the view of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and the ECB Governing Council that Christine Lagarde has all the credentials for the job. Her appointment is moreover a strong signal for gender balance within the ECB, something on which the Parliament has repeatedly taken a clear stance. The ECB’s role in the European economy cannot be overstated. The European Central Bank is tasked by the Treaties to secure price stability, a precondition for a well-functioning monetary area. The ECB’s decisive actions during the financial and economic crisis have averted a serious threat of deflation and allowed the euro area economy to recover steadily in recent years. However, the low inflation environment has become a persistent feature within the most advanced economies since the post-crisis period and monetary policy alone is not able to change that. For a more balanced and effective policy mix monetary policy should be supported by structural reforms and fiscal policy. On the side of structural reforms, we need to use all levers to facilitate the transformation which Europe’s businesses and employees will need to embark on in the coming years amid challenges like climate change, the digital age and global and political uncertainty. As regards fiscal policies, within the limits of fiscal sustainability, fiscal policy can provide a boost to domestic demand and investment. Christine Lagarde also stressed this point in her opening statement in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee and I could not agree more. In the longer term, I strongly believe that the deepening of economic and monetary union is also essential. In particular, deeper and better connected European capital markets and a completion of the banking union are key building blocks for a stronger and more resilient euro area. So I look forward to hearing your views and continuing our good cooperation with the European Central Bank.

This often gives the impression that the ECB is more economic lyrised than pursuing the primary objective of its mandate, which is to ensure price stability. Last week's decision to reinstate the bond-buying program, to cut interest rates even further, has once again poured oil on the fire. The European Central Bank under Mario Draghi has thus lost a great deal of confidence, as we are now also saying in the published opinion. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats are all the more pleased that Christine Lagarde, at the hearing in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, made her clear about the objectives enshrined in the Treaty. And, dear friends of social democracy, you are not blind and deaf when you comply with the Treaty, but you are faithful to the law. I would ask you to take note of this. In the medium term, however, committing to this goal also means that the European Central Bank must exit ultra-loose monetary policy in the medium term. The European economy, and also some european Union countries, cannot hang permanently on the drip of cheap money. Against this background, it is also laudable that Christine Lagarde has set herself the task of better communicating the monetary policy of the European Central Bank. This is urgently needed. Independence does not mean that you are not accountable for the decisions you have made. But better communication also means that Mrs Lagarde not only explains, but also listens and responds to criticism of monetary policy. These are the main questions for the future. The ECB needs to refocus on its mandate, communicate its decisions better.

The reality is that two weeks ago we had a meeting of the Committee on Economic and Economic Affairs where we evaluated her credentials and she passed the review in an extremely satisfactory way. We are here because some Members want to use the opportunity to criticise the actions of the European Central Bank over the past seven years. The reality is that the European Central Bank has been the institution it has been willing to fight, the only one that has been willing to fight a recession and a crisis that would have had unthinkable consequences without its action. And some say, \"monetary policy is trying to do too much, the European Central Bank is doing too much.\" And it is true, it is doing a lot, yes, but the reason is not because the European Central Bank wants it, the reason is because the Member States are not doing their part. Member States , as Mrs Lagarde said in her speech, can do quite a few things. On the one hand, half of the Member States of the European Union have no deficit or are close to zero. Given the context of interest rates, virtually zero, they can invest in their future, not because they are very good and want to do good for other States, but because it is the right thing for their own citizens. Similarly, states that have much less fiscal capacity, like my own country, such as Spain, can also do something. They can fight to make these structural reforms that are now paralyzed—reforms in the education market or labour market—and allow countries to acquire a much higher growth rate. Finally, we, the European Parliament and the European institutions can also do much more. We have paralyzed dossiers that we have to put in place, such as common deposit insurance or common unemployment insurance. We have a lot of things to do to make the growth rate recover.

A crumbling currency is not stable per se. That is why these attacks that the ECB has not fulfilled its mandate are completely out of the business. Instead, we have a situation where the Member States of the euro area are not doing their job, both in those countries that are facing economic problems, which are not making good progress in reforms, in socially just reforms that are also boosting the economy, but also in the surplus countries that are currently reducing debt, rather than giving room for economic development to take off, precisely in the sense of an ecological and social transformation of our economy. We are therefore pleased that Mrs Lagarde has made it clear that the Member States must adopt a common fiscal policy. This is the prerequisite for monetary policy to stop taking the risks associated with over-lax monetary policy. And we also have clear signals: for the first time, a woman at the head of the ECB and a greening of the common monetary policy.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what a strange feeling for the newly elected representatives that we are to have this debate on the presidency of the European Central Bank without the single candidate, Mrs Lagarde, deigning to be present. Yet it is now more than ever time to discuss together the role of the ECB and the objectives it must pursue. Because the currency is political and has nothing neutral, neither for the climate nor for inequality. Inequality, the word Christine Lagarde knows well and which she had in her mouth when she was president of the IMF, appears only twice in her questionnaire. On the other hand, price stability appears 26 times. When we talk to her about the climate or the reduction of inequality, she gives us the same answer: price stability. As a result, the ECB has injected more than EUR 2 trillion into the markets, of which only 10% has ended up in the real economy. The rest fueled a speculative bubble. For too long, monetary policy has served the richest. Even Mario Draghi recognized him. Despite the crisis - and the Greek example has tragically demonstrated this - the ECB still does not plan to put its policy at the service of the greatest number. So we heard Christine Lagarde and the European Commission speak in unison about Green Deal. But is it ready to stop funding those responsible for the disaster? No. Is it prepared to end the 63% of private debt buybacks that benefit polluting companies? No. Is it prepared to lend directly to the states to finance the ecological transition? Still not. Is it ready to focus on green financing? No. Above all, there should be no distortion in the sacrosanct market. And never mind if the planet has to pay the price. This obsession with the market is not suited to the emergencies of our time. Let us choose instead a monetary policy in the service of ecological and social transformation, an ECB that ensures that the money reinvested in the real economy stops financing polluting activities, assumes to regulate the market to favour green assets.  That is what we would have said to Mrs Lagarde if she had deigned to be here with us today. This is what our exchanges should be about rather than preparing a pre-run vote for a person convicted in court in his or her country.

They will then be twenty-five around the table, the six members of the ECB's Executive Board and the nineteen governors of the eurozone countries. So it will be, as you know, a collegial operation. Let me remind you that, during her hearing before our ECON committee, Mrs Lagarde described in three points how she viewed the function. First, she reiterated the need to respect the ECB's regulatory framework. It then indicated that it would adapt to the context of the current upheavals with agility and pragmatism. She also said, and this was reiterated by our EPP colleague, Mr Ferber, that there was a need to include civil society, young people, to better inform public opinion. Furthermore, it indicated that the core of its action at the head of the ECB would be based on taking climate risk into account, which will be a macro-economic priority for the ECB. It will therefore have to phase out the financial securities of the polluting companies it holds on its balance sheet. Lagarde also reiterated that fiscal stimulus will be needed, given the short-term challenges for the eurozone. Admittedly, the ECB is currently pursuing a very low interest rate policy, which can be worrying for savers. However, it also allows citizens to borrow, first-time buyers to acquire a property for the first time and businesses to borrow to invest and create jobs. Colleagues, let us be positive, certainly by being vigilant, but also bold, because in addition to being a woman, the first to hold this position, Christine Lagarde presents a strong asset to meet the challenges of the ECB for the next few years, namely her experience at the head of the IMF and the pragmatism that characterizes her.

The second thing that this debate shows, I think, is that we have rightly chosen an independent European Central Bank, which is not on the leash of politics.  Having said that, I must have one thing at heart: the side effects of the European Central Bank's policies affect people who have worked hard, who have built up their own pensions and who have saved for their old age and for their children. Christine Lagarde indicated in her hearing that she wanted to take into account these side effects of the policy. Mario Draghi then took measures that spared the banks, but not pension funds. So that would be my call in this debate, to also look at the side effects on pension funds. After all, let us be clear: there is a lot of talk these days about the European way of life, and then my question is: is the European way of life building up debt and burdening the next generation with a debt burden that they can never cope with, or is that also valuing the hard-working middle class who are saving for retirement themselves?

The failure of monetary policies in recent years with regard to the ECB's statutory objective is clear to all. The long-awaited inflation target below but close to 2% is getting further and further away, signalling a sharp slowdown in the euro area economy. Despite the accommodative monetary policy of recent years – rate cuts, LTRO, TLTRO, quantitative easing – the malfunctioning of transmission channels from monetary policy to the real economy is evident. The result is that it has flooded the banking system with liquidity, saving the Euro and the banks, but leaving businesses and citizens on their knees.

No major interference campaign was identified, but fact—checkers and academia have nonetheless flagged malicious activity from foreign sources to influence turnout and voter preferences. We have to be constantly prepared. We should make sustained efforts to raise awareness, increase preparedness and strengthen the resilience of our democracies to hybrid threats, including disinformation. This is a priority for our presidency. Long-term efforts are needed to enhance the resilience of our democratic societies since disinformation and hybrid threats in general are a permanent part of our security environment. The evolving nature of the threats and the growing risk of malicious interference and online manipulation associated with the development of artificial intelligence and data-gathering techniques require continuous assessment and an appropriate response. The Council welcomes the Commission’s intention to conduct an in-depth evaluation of the implementation of commitments made by online platforms and other signatories under the code of practice. The Council is monitoring the implementation in its working parties and will be ready to examine action that could be proposed by the Commission by the end of the year. Before the end of the year, we expect the Commission report on the 2019 European Parliament elections, which should pay particular attention to preparedness and resilience, geared to withstanding interference in elections. More broadly, it will be interesting to hear the thoughts of the Commission on possible further initiatives it might take. We attach great importance to this subject, as has been repeatedly underlined by the European Council, including in the new Strategic Agenda. The EU institutions and the Member States have an important role to play, in terms of their respective remits, in the protection of democratic processes. This requires concerted efforts by the EU and the Member States and also by civil society and the private sector. Our response has to be comprehensive, with the focus on both the internal and external dimensions of the threat. Since the conclusions the Council adopted in March on securing free and fair European elections, which welcomed the Commission electoral package and the Joint Action Plan Against Disinformation, much has been done both by the EU institutions and in individual Member States: the organisation of regular meetings of the European Election Cooperation Network, in which Member States share expertise and good practice and jointly identify threats; the setting up of the Rapid Alert System whereby national contact points in Member States rapidly share information on disinformation campaigns; the enhancement of strategic communication on European values and policies; the strengthening of the European media ecosystem by facilitating networks of independent fact-checkers; the promotion of media and digital literacy and awareness-raising activities to protect the integrity of the electoral process, together with the private sector and civil society; the assessment of cyber-threats in the electoral context and of the measures to address them and preserve the integrity of the electoral system; the monitoring, as already mentioned, of the implementation by social media platforms of the code of practice; and, finally, cooperation with the relevant international actors. So much has been done. To contribute to these efforts, the Romanian Presidency prepared a report to the last European Council on countering disinformation and on the lessons learned from the European elections. Continuing that work, one of the top priorities of our presidency is to enhance the resilience of our democratic societies against foreign interference, through coordinated and coherent action across all relevant policy fields in order to strengthen the comprehensive security of our citizens. I want to underline that all this work to protect our open, democratic societies must be carried out while fully respecting the fundamental rights of our citizens, including freedom of expression. In this context, our presidency places particular emphasis on strengthening the EU’s capabilities in countering hybrid threats and building resilience in the EU and Member States. Already in July, a permanent Council working party with a horizontal mandate was established and held its first meeting. It is also essential to continue developing partnerships, especially our cooperation with NATO. The Helsinki-based European Centre of Excellence for countering hybrid threats also contributes to fostering cooperation in this field. Disinformation strategies by foreign state and non-state actors are also deployed beyond our EU borders. Alongside tackling the problem within the Union, the Action Plan Against Disinformation outlines our significant interest in working with partners in the EU’s eastern and southern neighbourhood and in the Western Balkans. Exposing disinformation and strengthening media, information and digital-literacy skills in our neighbourhood are key elements in this regard. We need to act together in a structured and coordinated way in order to tackle these challenges.

We should not take them for granted. President—elect von der Leyen has announced that protecting European democracy will be a priority for her Commission. She underlined that our democratic systems have come increasingly under attack from those who wish to divide and destabilise the Union. Therefore, we need to do more to protect ourselves from external influences. The spread of disinformation and the influence of dark money affect policymaking processes by skewing public opinion and distorting the debate. Domestic and foreign actors can exploit this to manipulate policy, societal debates and behaviour in areas such as climate change, migration, public security, health and finance. Manipulation can also diminish trust in science and empirical evidence. The conduct of free and fair elections is primarily the responsibility of Member States. Nevertheless, a European approach is necessary, given the cross-border dimension of efforts to manipulate democracy and the importance of joining efforts to address the threats. What affects one Member State can affect all. Through the electoral package in September 2018, the Commission took determined action to support Member States’ efforts to protect the integrity of elections and combat disinformation. Implementing the package, the Commission encouraged national electoral networks to identify best practices for the management of risks to the electoral process. Cooperation between Member States was fostered by the newly established European cooperation network on elections, which allowed exchange of best practices and creation of operational links between Member States. The network met four times in the run—up to the elections and had a first stocktaking meeting immediately after the elections.  It brought together representatives from the national networks, who had fruitful exchanges among themselves and with representatives of other institutions, including Parliament and civil society. Its activities cover all aspects of this complex area, from exchanges on awareness—raising for citizens and cooperation with platforms, to the mapping of legal instruments applicable to foreign funding. It also included a table—top exercise at European level to help Member States assess and potentially strengthen their resilience to cyber—attacks. Member States engaged actively in the European cooperation network and expressed their desire for both the national and the European networks to continue their work beyond the European elections in order to support Member States’ efforts to increase the resilience of their electoral systems. Our preliminary assessment on the implementation of these efforts in the context of the recent European elections is quite encouraging. The coordinated EU approach helped to ensure stronger preparedness and coordination in the fight against manipulation and disinformation. As was done for previous elections, we are currently conducting a thorough examination of the conduct of the elections to the European Parliament. We are also cooperating with international partners through a range of forums, including NATO and the G7, as well as with individual states. This reflects a comprehensive and coordinated approach among democracies to tackle disinformation and foster resilient electoral processes. International cooperation ensures that the tools and unique capabilities of all actors act in unison, in full respect of fundamental rights, in particular the freedom of expression and of association.  As announced by President—elect von der Leyen, the Commission – if confirmed by Parliament – will aim to put forward a European democracy action plan addressing the threats of external intervention in our European elections. If confirmed in the vice—president role by this House, I will coordinate the work on this plan. Building up the resilience of our democratic systems and countering of disinformation and fake information are necessities of our current situation. Not less important, the freedoms of expression and of the press in the landscape of media pluralism will also be pursued and protected by the next Commission. In all these efforts – again, if confirmed in my future role by this House – I will work closely with Parliament, with the Member States, with citizens and with stakeholders on protecting and nurturing democracy in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 113, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Julian King", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I’m going to focus on the challenge of disinformation. As we’ve already heard, fortunately during the recent European parliamentary elections, there was no large-scale, coordinated disinformation attack. But that does not mean, unfortunately, that those elections were a disinformation free zone. They were not. There are myriad reports from across Europe of different sorts of disinformation. For example, to take an example from another Member State, let’s take an example from Germany. There are well-researched reports that show that online promotion for one of the German parties represented up to 86% of all party activity on Facebook. Four times the comments, six times the shares of all other political parties combined. Many of these likes and shares came from a cluster of 80 000 suspicious accounts, with random two-letter first and last names, that each mutually liked hundreds and thousands of pieces of content. Large-scale automated propaganda and disinformation is unfortunately a fact. It’s a fact of our modern political life, and if the platforms can’t figure out that thousands of coordinated accounts with random two-letter names are suspicious, then we have a problem.  I don’t know about you but I don’t think we can accept this as the new normal. We need to do more to work together to close down the space in which hostile and bad actors are trying to do this disinformation and to build our resilience to make it harder to do and to allow us to resist its impact. Which is why we, together with the Member States and a number of other partners, have been working on at least four areas.  First, as has been mentioned, we’ve established a rapid alert system bringing the EU institutions and the Member States together to work to spot and tackle coordinated disinformation campaigns. We’re working to reinforce this mechanism. We’re doing a series of consultations at the moment to enhance how we do information exchange between the Member States, the institutions and with the platforms, as well as civil society researchers, and to build a strengthened hub for research and analytics of disinformation. Second, over the past two years in fact, we have mobilised a community of fact checkers, researchers and civil society, to help detect and analyse disinformation campaigns and to discuss how we design our responses. To boost the impact of this work, of this community, we will soon deploy a new European online platform to bring together 38 fact-checking organisations from across 17 Member States, working on this platform funded through the Connecting Europe Facility programme. But if they’re going to do this work effectively, we also need the platforms to play their part. We need them to provide secure access to data for these trusted fact checkers and researchers to enable them to do their research, to enable us together to unlock better responses. All the time, of course, making sure that we respect the necessary ethical and professional standards, which brings me to the third point we’ve been working on. We’ve pushed the big Internet platforms to sign up to a code of practice on disinformation, as has already been set out. We finalised that work in September last year. The initial signatories – Facebook, Google, Twitter, Mozilla, trade associations from the advertising sector – have, I’m glad to say, now been joined also by Microsoft.  So this is a serious group of people. They took together a list of commitments – 15 different commitments – and we are monitoring the performance against those commitments. By the middle of September – anytime now – we are going to see the signatories deliver their own self assessment to us. Then we are going to work with a number of third-party consultants to deliver an independent third-party review of performance against those commitments by the middle of October.  Building on those reports, we’d expect to communicate our overview of where we are on implementation of the code before the end of October. Then the final step, our full assessment, will come in the form of a Commission communication which is planned to be published at the beginning of next year after further consultations with independent experts as well as Member States in the European Regulators Group for Audiovisual Media Services. As Commissioner Jourová, as I and as Commissioner Gabriel have said on a number of occasions, should the results prove unsatisfactory we think that we need to look – or be ready to look – at further actions, including, if necessary, the possibility of regulation.  Indeed there have already been a number of proposals, legislative and otherwise, put forward in various Member States. For example the UK Government has set out its intentions in the Online Harms White Paper, while in France there’s a push for a framework to make platforms more accountable.  We encourage the Member States in these efforts and stand ready to assist where we can.  Fourth and finally, we have worked to empower citizens, including by promoting, as we’ve heard, media literacy and increasing awareness across society on the positive impact of EU policies, Union values, to strengthen our citizens’ resilience against the negative effects of disinformation. Overall I think I’d have to say that we’ve done some good work. We’ve come some way, but frankly there remains a lot still to be done, which is why, like Věra Jourová, I’m very pleased to see that the incoming Commission, the incoming President-elect, have underlined the importance of this work. In addition to the point that’s already been mentioned, if confirmed it’s in the programme, the President-elect has said that she wants to bring forward legislation for a coordinated European approach on the human and ethical implications of AI, which would be very relevant to this debate, and she’s proposed a new digital services act to upgrade liability and safety rules for digital platforms, services and products – again, very relevant to this debate.  And these efforts, combined with the others that we have been discussing, are going to be absolutely key if we are to ensure a prosperous, safe and democratic digital future for all our citizens.

Cyber—attacks have risen to an unprecedented level, with dangerous access to strategic infrastructure and data. Crucial electoral rules on the financing of political parties by third countries have been either breached or circumvented. In July, Italian media revealed a plan by Russians to fund Matteo Salvini’s League. That is only the latest incident and, as we know, this goes well beyond just Russia or just Italy.

We know that foreign powers that do not want good in the European Union - we talked about Russia, it is not only Russia, but Russia, it is clear, it is established, it is defined - have financed, to the tune of one billion euros, information elements, funding of our political parties, mainly those who want to destroy the European Union and who end up in the extreme right of this Chamber. , in Italy, France and elsewhere. So we do have to fight the financing of political parties and the resolution is very important. We must give ourselves the means and the means to StratCom, which has three million euros a year. Three million euros... five million - this has been increased, you are right, Commissioner, to raise it - but in the face of a billion. Let us be serious, let us give ourselves the means to be able to act on the elements of misinformation. Let us give ourselves the means to ban foreign funding of our European democracy and our political parties, and give ourselves the means of technological independence.

In the brochure \"60 Reasons for the EU\" published by the European Commission, the peoples of Europe are given 64 pages to explain the benefits of the EU and the euro.

For example, a Czech team of experts on countering hybrid threats published figures that between 2014 and 16 elections and referendums within the European Union were directly influenced by putin's administration, either through state media or through various trolls on social networks. Worse, those trolls are getting into our national governments and our national parliaments. I therefore call on all of you to put aside political correctness and to make it very clear that the aggressor in this case, when it comes to disinformation, is the Putin administration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 157, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Vladimír BILČÍK", "mepid": "197771", "text": "   –Mr President, hybrid warfare, and the spread of disinformation and fake news in particular, threaten our democratic institutions across Europe.

As just the most recent hybrid hacker attack on Austria illustrates, smaller European democracies are especially vulnerable to foreign interference in national elections and, I should add, the subsequent spread of disinformation as we see it in Austria today. At the same time, smaller European democracies possess more limited resources to communicate effectively with global internet platforms about how best to fight against disinformation attacks. Therefore, in order to protect democracy across Europe, we need a strong and common European political approach in managing our communication and cooperation with social media in our struggle against disinformation campaigns.

The truth— and we must not deceive ourselves — is that fake news is the instrument of the enemies of open societies, they are the instrument of authoritarian regimes that direct public opinions from power or from populist forces seeking to condition public debates to achieve their objectives. Two clear examples of this are what we have recently experienced with Brexit or what happened recently, what we suffered in Spain, during the crisis of the secessionist challenge that occurred in 2017. On that occasion Catalan independence showed its mastery in the use of propaganda, manipulation and the dissemination of falsehoods, trying to project a negative image of Spain that in no way corresponds to reality. This whole situation is not solved eer by censorship or by limits to freedom of expression. What this phenomenon highlights is the need to have, now more than ever, a media that guarantees the quality of the information they offer to citizens.

As a number of you have underlined, disinformation campaigns are designed to hamper the ability of our citizens to make informed choices, to divide our society and our communities, and to call into question the outcomes of our electoral processes and the integrity of our democratic institutions. I don’t think that we can accept this as a new normal. We must be ready to do more to counter it.  Part of the problem comes from outside of the EU. A number of you have mentioned Russia. Let me be clear: there is a team – it’s been referred to in the institutions – whose job it is to monitor pro-Kremlin disinformation campaigns, and they report – this is publicly available – that, over a recent period when they checked, the amount of pro-Kremlin coordinated disinformation across our Member States had doubled compared with a year ago. So this is a real problem, and we should not duck that. Let me also be clear that others have learned from the Russian playbook, so we have to build our resilience – we have to build our counter-measures to resist and counter disinformation, wherever it comes from.  That’s why we’ve put in place – from the Commission’s side, working with the Member States and with civil society – a series of measures. But I am not pleased, and we are not resting on our laurels: we say we need to do more. We need to do more on tackling online disinformation, and we need to do more on reinforcing the resilience of our elections. In the coming weeks and months, we will review the Code of Practice on Disinformation to ensure that we can do better to protect the integrity of our democratic societies, and we will report to you on this by the end of October. Let me just say, in response to one or two of the comments, that this Code of Practice on Disinformation which we are pursuing with the social media platforms has absolutely nothing to do with censorship. It has absolutely nothing to do with the idea of a Ministry of Truth. It is not about determining that a particular political comment is good or bad, true or false. It is about shining a light on the provenance of political debate. It is about transparency, so that our citizens know when they see information where it comes from, who’s paying for it, and whether it’s a human or an artificial machine that is circulating that information. I think that is essential, if we’re going to be able to equip our citizens to make good choices. We will also come back to you to report on the conduct of the European Parliament elections and the implementation of the election package of measures on free and fair elections. Again, we will work on a European democracy action plan to build the resilience of our democratic systems, and we expect to put forward – subject to confirmation – legislative proposals to ensure greater transparency on paid political advertising and clearer rules on the financing of European political parties. Alongside this, at the same time, we will continue to work with fact—checkers, researchers and civil society, as well as the Member States and online platforms, so that together we can make the progress we need to ensure a prosperous, safe and democratic future for Europe and our citizens.

Facing this problem is not done with the invention of an external enemy; it is done with the democratization of the media, with the end of the concentration in large groups of the media, with the end of the submission of the contents to the interests of the major economic groups, with the strengthening of the public media, with the valorization of the working conditions of professionals in the sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 181, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  The next item on the agenda is the debate on the statements by the Council and the Commission on forest fires in the Amazon region (2019/2811 (RSP)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 182, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I believe I am not alone in saying that the matter that is before us today, the forest fires that are currently ravaging the Amazon region, is deeply worrying for us all. The fires are a tragedy, not only for the people directly affected but also, more broadly, for our planet and the climate.  It cannot be overstated how important preserving the Amazon rainforest is for effective global climate action. The Amazon rainforest is also uniquely rich and diverse. It is home to one in ten species on Earth. Deforestation, mainly caused by human action and climate change, is a serious threat. It causes a drastic loss of species and tropical rainforest.  These fires are directly related to intentional deforestation. Unfortunately, we note with concern that they have been even more severe in recent days in the rainforest of Brazil and across the border in Bolivia and Paraguay. These fires are severely polluting the air, they are killing many species of rainforest plants and animals and they are expelling indigenous people out of their territories.  The EU’s leadership in global climate action and the protection of forests are among the priorities of the Finnish Presidency. Forest fires have devastating consequences for human and animal life. We depend on forests to preserve biodiversity, to limit global warming and to provide people with jobs and livelihoods. Forests will also make an essential contribution to the EU’s aspirations of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. This House discussed the preparations for the UN Climate Action Summit this morning and our debate this afternoon is very relevant to this indeed.  Despite the actions taken so far at EU level and the commitments undertaken at international level, deforestation and forest degradation remain on the rise. The devastating fires in the Amazon region have made the need to step up this effort even more pressing.  In April 2019, the Council adopted conclusions on the progress made in the implementation of the EU forest strategy. On that occasion, the Council stressed the importance of the strategy to ensure the coherence and coordination of the EU and Member States’ policies affecting forests and to promote further the sustainable management of forests. The Agriculture and Fisheries Council will hold a debate next month on the need for a new strategy beyond 2020, building on the same principles but also considering the new policy developments at Member State, EU and international level.  The Council and Parliament have recently received a long—awaited communication from the Commission on stepping up EU action to protect and restore the world’s forests. We will examine in detail the list of priority actions proposed in this report and we look forward to your ideas on this matter. The Council is working to provide some feedback to the Commission’s communication in the form of Council conclusions that we hope to adopt in December 2019.  Given that drivers of deforestation go beyond the forestry sector, our intention is to involve, in this exercise, policy experts from connected areas such as environment, agriculture and trade. We look forward to your reactions to this communication too and trust that they will make a valuable contribution to the future course of action.  Let me conclude by underlining that the forest fires in the Amazon region are an urgent global crisis which requires an effective international response. Close cooperation with the countries of the Amazon region is crucial. These countries, such as Brazil, have the full right to lead the response but they need to live up to their commitments. I strongly appeal to the countries in the Amazon Basin and their leaders for urgent action. We are ready to work together with Mr Bolsonaro and others. The EU is ready to support but we need action now.  As the Council Presidency, Finland stands ready to support the EU’s reflection on how it can best contribute. On Finland’s initiative, the EU Foreign Ministers discussed the issue at their informal meeting in Helsinki at the end of the August. The Foreign Ministers agreed on the gravity of the situation and stressed the need for a coordinated and comprehensive EU approach to address the crisis. As the Council Presidency, we will continue to do our best to contribute to ensuring united, consistent and effective EU action on this matter.

Current forest fires across the globe are releasing great amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, deepening that crisis, not only in the Amazon, but also in other parts of the world, such as Siberia. But the Amazon is a unique forest, unique for the oxygen that we breathe, unique for the biodiversity that it hosts and unique for the health of our planet. I am, therefore, grateful that you have put this issue high on your agenda. Halting deforestation is key and is essential for three main reasons: to stop biodiversity loss, to address climate change and to achieve the 2030 agenda for sustainable development and our commitments under the Paris Agreement.  The degradation and loss of forests have major consequences on stability and security, on human rights, the climate, biodiversity and the health and livelihoods of both local communities and the wider planet. The European Commission is helping address the situation in the Amazon countries affected by forest fires, and is in regular contact with the relevant authorities, including those in Brazil. A number of operational instruments have already been activated to improve the current situation. Following Bolivia’s request, the Emergency Response Coordination Centre has already sent a team of fire-fighting experts to the country. Such assistance could be provided to any affected country upon official request. Also, the Copernicus emergency mapping system has been activated and maps are being produced for the fires in Brazil, in Bolivia and affected parts of Peru and Paraguay. These are in the public domain. The European Union is already financing development projects which are related to forest and land use in the Amazon basin, including in Brazil – for a total of EUR 128 million – and is planning new actions for a total of EUR 28 million. We are in close contact with the Chilean authorities and the Colombian authorities who have been active in coordinating regional efforts to address the situation. At the recent G7 summit, we were engaged in the preparations for a high—level meeting on the Amazon region on the margins of the United Nations General Assembly. While the immediate priority is fighting wildfires, it is necessary to address the underlying structural causes, such as agricultural expansion. In July, the Commission adopted the communication stepping up EU election to protect and restore the world’s forests. The communication outlines a comprehensive set of actions, including support for sustainable land—use practices. This entails working with partner countries to reduce pressures on forests and to encourage forest restoration. For the European Union’s part, we are addressing our consumption footprint on land; we are assessing additional demand—side, regulatory and non-regulatory measures to minimise the risk of importing products associated with deforestation and forest degradation. We are also working to improve the availability and the quality of information on forests and commodity supply chains, inter alia, by establishing an EU observatory on deforestation and forest degradation. Sound scientific information is an important element of the EU’s strategy; collaboration with partner countries is also key, inter alia, to identifying the long-term economic consequences of further deforestation. The Commission is committed to sustained action against deforestation and we stand ready to assist those affected by the recent forest fires in the Amazon and across the globe, in any way that we can, and in close cooperation with these countries’ authorities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 184, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I want to thank in particular Ms Tuppurainen. She has particular knowledge on forests so we are very happy that under her Presidency we’re having this debate, and indeed the detail which the Commissioner has delivered to us.  I dare say many of the visitors in the Chamber will have seen the forest fires in the Amazon. It’s what motivated me to hold this debate and I am glad that the Group supported us talking about this issue. It really is a question of how globally we can work together, because no nation on its own can solve this problem. But at a time when nations want to be sovereign, is it possible for multilateralism to be strengthened rather than weakened? And pointing the finger at countries doesn’t help. We have to show where the failings are but also acknowledge where progress has been made. So to Brazil, for example, there is action recently around the Leticia Pact with seven other South American countries, Operation Law and Order Guarantee and Operation Green Brazil, but this comes after pressure from the international community. We will all suffer if the Amazon dies and it is already under threat. You have outlined that in great detail.  I was pleased the Commissioner mentioned the need to look at policy coherence around the fact that land is being, if you like, brought into production and forest destroyed for agriculture reasons, and we’ve signed a deal, the Mercosur trade agreement, and we must make sure that the climate and biodiversity commitments contained in that deal with our Mercosur counterparts are honoured. I think that for us in this House will be key.  We do need a carrot and stick approach to this issue. We should also as Europeans put our own hands up and say that we have not always valued forests or biodiversity or done the right thing for the environment, and perhaps in that place of humility we can work better with our colleagues in South America and elsewhere, because in the Arctic, in Indonesia, in the Congo Basin, there are fires burning, turf fires which are releasing massive amounts of carbon.

The environmental, social and economic impact of this tragedy goes far beyond the Amazon basin. The Amazon is the earth's lung, produces 20% of our planet's oxygen and hosts more plant species than any other ecosystem. In addition, it is the home of more than one million indigenous people who have been living there sustainably for generations, and now their natural heritage has to be defended. And I know this reality perfectly, because I had the great opportunity to volunteer for a month with non-governmental organizations that support these indigenous communities, who need to have sustainable alternatives to their livelihood. I can't imagine how you'll find yourself today after seeing this tragic situation. This is not the first time the Amazon has been devoured by flames, it is true, but this year they have increased by more than 80% compared to last year and in protected areas it keeps increasing. The search for gold increases the deforestation and mercury used contaminates the water, air and food of people and animals. This catastrophe responds to irresponsible policies, driven by climate change denialists, and we know it perfectly well. Mr Bolsonaro is promoting a new gold rush, supported by land hoarders, while ignoring environmental protection. In order not to have to listen to the truth, Mr Bolsonaro has dismissed those responsible for the Brazilian Space Research Institute and the Institute of Environment and Renewable Resources. Mr President, it is the point of non-return for the Amazon and almost 20% of the Amazon has already been deforested. Because, beyond environmental drama, the Social Democrats are also very concerned about the fate of indigenous peoples and their lands. We are witnessing an escalation of violence in indigenous territories throughout Brazil, the killings of indigenous leaders and activists, such as Emira Waipi, Dilma Ferreira Silva and Claudionor Costa da Silva. From the European Union we closely follow regional efforts to find solutions and protect both people and the environment. They have the full support of our group and we will continue to collaborate. We call on Mr Bolsonaro to comply with the international obligations of the Paris Climate Agreement and the environmental clauses set out in the Agreement with Mercosur. If the government turn a deaf ear, it will isolate Brazil from the rest of the international community.

We all stood in shock as we watched the Amazon burn, but the shock got even bigger when we heard Brazilian President Bolsonaro blaming it on the NGOs who were trying to protect the Amazon rainforest, when in reality it was his reckless policies that contributed to the havoc that we saw.  But let’s be honest: the forest was not burning only in the Amazon. This summer, we saw forests burning from Siberia to Alaska, destroying precious habitats and, effectively, the Earth’s lungs. We have to be clear: forest destruction is a global problem. But it is also time for us to admit that we are part of the problem – that not only our contribution to greenhouse gas emissions, but also our own policies, our own trade and our own law enforcement are to blame.  It is time to change that. It is time for this House to act. We need to say that the Mercosur Agreement is a bit problematic as it stands, but it would be very cheap to say, ‘let’s just shoot down the Mercosur Agreement and everything is solved’. We need to go much deeper. The new incoming Commission claims that the European Green Deal is the top priority. It should not be only about Europe; it needs to go beyond that. It needs to impact the entire world.

There are no sanctions in that sustainable-development chapter and let me say that, as I understand it, the Commission’s communication on deforestation and forest degradation contains one promise and that is to look into regulatory measures on the demand side, because we need badly European legislation which makes it sure for the European consumers that they are not buying deforestation.

And it is a disgrace to the European Parliament that this debate will not result in a resolution under the responsibility of an alliance of right-wing and far-right political groups.

And if that doesn't work at all, then that's a big problem for the global climate as well.  But there are also forest fires elsewhere, and we should talk about this at least as intensively. The fires in Siberia and Alaska pose a huge threat to the climate, as large amounts of methane also escape there, which is even more harmful to the climate than CO2. So now no primitive discussion: some are calling for Mercosur to stop – in theory, we could stop all trade with these countries, but are we going to go a step further? Do we then have a means of exerting pressure? Do we then have control over what China and others are doing? I believe that the path of dialogue – of course, exert pressure and also not wave through Mercosur uncritically, but deal with it openly and see how we can really tackle the problem at its root.

The prospect of the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement is a unique opportunity to hold Brazil to its commitments under the Paris Climate Agreement, such as to restore and reforest 12 million hectares and to attain zero illegal deforestation by 2030, as already stated by my colleague, Peter Liese. Trade policy is no silver bullet for these problems, but it sure can be helpful. For example, through plurilateral agreements on trade in environmental goods, it now lies in our hands to work on the appropriate flanking measures, such as monitoring and certification schemes.

My first answer to this is that the EU must speak with one voice. In the future, as with the negotiation of trade agreements, the EU will have to weigh all the weight of 28 Member States and show its face and profile when it comes to protecting forests. Secondly, we should make environmental and climate protection an integral part of our development cooperation and EU diplomacy. We are now at the beginning of a new legislature. A new Commission is taking up its work. And quite honestly, I am missing the topic of environmental and climate protection in the mission statements of Josep Borrell and Jutta Urpilainen.

This debate has reiterated that the ongoing fires in the Amazon basin are deeply worrying to all of us, all the more so against the backdrop of devastating fires raging in other parts of the world. Many have said – and I totally agree – that we have to tackle and we have to be concerned about all forest fires everywhere, whether it’s in Angola, Siberia, the Arctic, the subarctic region, central Africa, Europe, Southeast Asia or South America. All these fires once more underline the sense of urgency required in joining our forces to fight climate change. Forests are indispensable and are vital to our efforts to fight climate change. Protecting forests is a significant part of our and everybody’s responsibility to meet the commitments under the Paris Agreement.  Most of the speakers spoke about the EU—Mercosur trade agreement. In the trade and sustainable development chapter of the EU—Mercosur trade agreement, both the EU and the Mercosur countries, including Brazil, accepted an explicit commitment to effectively implement the Paris Agreement. Brazil’s nationally determined contribution under the Paris Agreement includes commitments on deforestation and reforestation. These are reinforced by private—sector initiatives, such as the Soy Moratorium or commitments by Brazilian meatpackers not to source meat from farms in recently deforested areas. In addition to provisions to promote sustainable trade and the trade agreement itself, let me note that the trade deal is part of an overall association agreement covering dialogue on human rights and cooperation in many fields, including the environment and climate change. It will provide the EU and, indeed, the European Parliament with additional instruments for dialogue and cooperation and help bring our markets and citizens closer together.  Many are concerned that we have to make certain that the commitments are there and that the commitments are honoured. The EU—Mercosur Agreement includes a comprehensive trade and sustainable development chapter containing legally binding commitments on environmental protection, as well as climate change, including a commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The Commission has a range of tools and mechanisms available to ensure that these commitments are respected. Where a party fails to comply with a commitment, we can resort to the dispute settlement mechanism, tailored to the specifics of labour and environment.  We trust and expect, but above all, we will ensure that Brazil will live up to its own commitments in the framework of the Paris Agreement, which includes a pledge by Brazil to reduce by 2025 its net greenhouse gas emissions by 37% compared to 2005 levels, and an action plan to stop illegal deforestation, including in the Brazilian Amazon. On our part, we also committed a pledge by the EU to reduce our domestic emissions by at least 40% by 2030.  Some MEPs commented that we should also tackle the demand side regarding the marketing of products associated with deforestation. A legislative framework preventing products associated with deforestation to reach the EU market is key. It is essential. The EU already has domestic regulations banning, for example, the sale of illegally harvested timber. The main objective of the regulation is to reduce illegal deforestation and give consumers better assurances about the products that they buy. When it comes to any future EU domestic measures relating to products associated with deforestation, let me refer to our recent communication on deforestation where we have announced a number of other measures in this regard. Those measures include reinforcing standards and certification schemes to identify and to promote deforestation-free commodities, exploring possible additional demand—side regulatory and non-regulatory measures to increase supply—chain transparency and to minimise the risk of importing products associated with deforestation and forest degradation, also, promoting forest-relevant considerations and activities to foster corporate social responsibility and responsible business conduct and, finally, establishing a stakeholder platform on deforestation allowing for discussions between government officials, NGO businesses, retailers, and so on.  To conclude, let me remind everyone that the final legal texts of the Association Agreement and its trade aspect will be submitted to the EU Member States and to the European Parliament for approval.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 245, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, to conclude I wish to thank you for this very useful debate on a pressing issue that concerns us all. We all share the view that we need to do our utmost to protect our forests. We need to improve the EU’s action on this matter and continue working towards honouring our international commitments.  Many of you referred to the Mercosur Trade Agreement. The trade agreement with Mercosur contains a robust trade and sustainable development chapter which lives up to the highest standards comparable to those in other modern agreements. The basic premise is that increased trade should not come at the expense of the environment or labour conditions; on the contrary, it should promote sustainable development.  The Mercosur Agreement contains a specific article on climate change committing the parties to effectively implement the Paris Agreement. There are also commitments on fighting deforestation. However, just like here in Parliament, discussions in the Council on the EU-Mercosur Agreement are still in an early phase. It is clear that sufficient time will be needed for a comprehensive examination of the negotiated agreement. It will be important for both of our institutions to have an honest debate on the agreement, based on facts.  I would also like to note that open, ambitious and rules-based trade policy which is value-based, sustainable and inclusive is a priority for the Finnish Presidency. Many of you also referred to the urgency of climate action. The time to act on climate change is now, not later. We believe that the EU can have an effect on others by setting an example. This is why it is crucial to agree on an ambitious target of climate neutrality in the European Union by 2050 as soon as possible.  We must preserve the Amazon rainforest for the generations to come. Huge damage has been done so far, which I deplore, but we need to focus on preventing further deterioration. We need to protect our forests in the Amazon and elsewhere because we need to protect our lives. Deforestation is a global challenge with many complicated aspects. For that reason cooperation within the Council configuration is an elementary part of successful work. The cooperation between the EU institutions is even more important and for that reason, we are all here today. Thank you very much once again for your active participation and for your attention.

The destruction of the Amazon has not begun now. Multinationals and other economic groups have long disputed the amazon's resources. This dispute finds expression in the economic, political and geostrategic planes, and involves the appropriation of land, raw materials, resources extracted from nature.

This is an area that describes itself as the lungs of the world (it produces 20% of the world's oxygen) and has a key role to play in managing climate change. Large-scale fires occurring there, on the other hand, have the potential to release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. I would like to touch on this issue from the point of view of trade relations between the European Union and the MERCOSUR countries, namely Brazil. It is certainly a good thing that the proposed AGREEMENT between the EU and MERCOSUR contains measures to combat climate change. On the other hand, we have seen the Brazilian Government and the President approach a disaster of this size rather laxly. Also worrying is the fact that, under the current President of Brazil, deforestation in the Amazon has increased by 88% – regardless of fires. The draft agreement with MERCOSUR aims to develop common trade relations. It is clear that Brazilian producers need outlets.

They are vital from the point of view of biodiversity, climate protection and economic and social well-being. Brazil, too, must be made more committed through international agreements to the protection of valuable forests, sustainable forest management and the safeguarding of biodiversity.

I would like to start by expressing our solidarity with the people of Burkina. More than 200 people have been killed so far in 2019, including 60 victims in the last month. This insecurity climate puts more pressure on already overstretched social services. The number of internally displaced persons is now reaching 300 000 people, posing a serious challenge to the delivery of food, health or sanitation services, but also in terms of social cohesion. That Jihadist groups are now targeting both security forces and civilians, with a clear strategy to force local antagonism and create a circle of vengeance between different communities. They are trying to incite a war of religion in a country that has a long history of peaceful coexistence between faiths and communities. The European Union is today closer than ever to the people of Burkina Faso. The country is currently at the heart of our action in the Sahel. In the last seven years we have mobilised more than EUR 1 billion for development programmes in Burkina. High Representative Mogherini was in Ouagadougou over the summer, on the occasion of the fifth annual ministerial meeting between the EU and the G5 Sahel. During the meeting, she announced an extra EUR 138 million in support of the joint military force of the G5 Sahel, which has an important role in fighting terrorism and organised crime across the region. Our military and civilian missions in the Sahel are also working more and more across the region, alongside France’s Operation Barkhane. Coordination between security and development policies is one of the essential challenges, and this was one of the main messages that the High Representative delivered during her visit. We are glad that the G5 countries have committed to adopting an integrated, strategic framework precisely to synchronise their efforts on security and on development and to identify priority regions for their actions. The Government of Burkina has also extended the emergency plan for the Sahel to its eastern regions, which is a positive development. During her visit, Ms Mogherini called for urgent progress on security-sector reform. The fight against terrorism can only bear fruit if security forces respect the rule of law and human rights. This is the only way to build trust between state authorities and all sectors of the population. The recent national dialogue is an important building block for national cohesion. It is crucial that all ethnic communities in Burkina feel that they are part of a common national family. As the terrorists incite hatred and inter-ethnic tensions, the state should push in the opposite direction and invest in a shared sense of belonging for all its citizens. Security is vital but it is not the only answer to the challenges that the country is facing. Linking political, security and development issues will be more and more essential. Let me just mention that during her trip to Burkina, the High Representative also visited an EU-funded school, because education is the foundation of any country’s strength. International coordination is also crucial and the EU is willing to engage even more with the whole region. This is the reason why we took the opportunity of the Economic Community of West African States (Ecowas) extraordinary summit on terrorism in Ouagadougou last Saturday to discuss with countries of a wider region how they can contribute more to counteract terrorism and how we can coordinate our respective actions. Since 2015, a peaceful country like Burkina Faso has had to face unprecedented violence. We Europeans have stepped up our support to stop this escalation, to stabilise a crucial region for our own security and to help the people of the Sahel take their future into their hands. We will continue to be a strong partner for Burkina and for its people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 258, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "György HÖLVÉNYI", "mepid": "124715", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support. The mass-killing terror group Islamic State is pursuing a new strategy after its retranch in the Middle East. Let's be clear and clear. Today, the caliphate is expanding its wings in the sahel, which is in a weak security situation, and burkina faso is considered a bridgehead in this process. In Mali, Niger, Chad and the bordering Region of Burkina Faso, 1.2 million people now need urgent humanitarian assistance due to religious and ethnic conflicts. Nearly 500 people have been killed in Islamist terror attacks in Burkina Faso since 2015. These targets included city centres, army buildings, embassies, and educational institutions. Almost 2,000 schools, I repeat, had to be closed, causing 300,000 pupils to fall out of education.  In 2019, attacks with a specific religious hue increased dramatically. Christian communities are at particular risk. In February, terrorists shot dead Spanish Salasian monk César Fernández. A total of 57 Christians have been killed in attacks on churches this year. From Europe, we must help the region to preserve what we have heard before, ethnic and religious diversity. For a good solution, we need to see that churches have a crucial social and security role. I think it is essential that the European institutions must end extreme neutrality, on whose behalf we regularly, systematically, together ignore attacks on the denominations. We need to understand that the persecution of religious communities, such as large numbers of Christian denominations, leads to the dismantling of the social structure and the increase of emigration.

But, as President Kaboré said, Burkina Faso is also vulnerable by its poverty. Fighting terrorism is not just about the military response, but about robust strategies that are development strategies. It is in this context that Burkina Faso has taken measures to protect production sectors, such as the production of food oil or sugar which, when produced by The Burkinabe, produce employment and are cheaper for Burkinabe. So what is the union's coherence when it promotes agreements such as the free trade agreement with West Africa, which destroys local employment and generates poverty for local populations, and then sending military contingents to fight Boko Haram? Wouldn't it be smarter, more coherent, more structuring to ensure partnerships that protect local economies rather than weaken them?

No one imagined that building peace would be easy but, three years on, the great majority of Colombians would never go back to the dark years of their country’s history.  High Representative Mogherini was in Colombia last week and she saw a country that looks forward, not backwards. President Duque has confirmed his willingness to keep implementing the peace deal. The leadership of the FARC as a political party and the vast majority of former fighters remain committed to the agreement. It is true that a small group of FARC dissidents have decided to take up arms again. We have strongly condemned this announcement because more violence is simply not the answer to the challenges that the country is facing. But we must not forget that this is only a small group of dissidents. This doesn’t mean that we do not see the challenges the peace process is facing. The killings of local leaders, human rights defenders and ex-FARC members are alarming and unacceptable. As the local and regional elections next month approach, we also see assassinations of candidates.  The High Representative has welcomed the actions taken by the Government to ensure protection of those under threat, to bring the perpetrators to justice and to dismantle these criminal networks. But most importantly, she also offered the European Union’s practical help. We are complementing government efforts through support to civil society, and have supported a special investigation unit in the Prosecutor’s Office and, together with the EU Member States, the campaign ‘Defendamos la vida’ All in all, this was the main message that she delivered to the Government and the people of Colombia: the European Union is with you. We want to help Colombia win the peace.  During her visit to Bogotá, the High Representative announced a number of measures to step up our support to the peace process. She met with the top officials in the three main institutions of the transitional justice system: the Truth Commission, the Search Unit for Missing Persons and the Peace Court. She announced EUR 4.5 million in support for the Truth Commission, which adds to our support for the Search Unit, and we are also planning to support the Peace Court. So far, the EU has invested around EUR 645 million over these last years to support peace in Colombia, including through the creation of a specific Trust Fund. The European Union is also the largest foreign investor in Colombia, with a special focus on sustainable development in the areas that were most hit by the conflict. On top of this, the High Representative also announced a new package to support Colombian solidarity towards refugees and migrants from Venezuela. We are putting an extra EUR 30 million on top of the EUR 120 million already invested.  There are now 1.4 million refugees and migrants from Venezuela who have found refuge in Colombia. Columbia’s generosity in welcoming and hosting these people sets an example to the region and to the world. However, to praise is not enough. Columbia and the countries from the region need more international support and the European Union is doing its part, leading the way among the international community.  The Colombian people know that they can count on the continued commitment and support of the EU in their daily work to win the peace. Since the peace deal was signed, the European Union and its Member States have invested EUR 1.5 billion in support of peace in Colombia. The people of Colombia are showing an amazing courage and perseverance in seeking the mediations that are essential to build a truly inclusive and peaceful democracy. We believe in them. Europe believes in Colombia and we will keep supporting all of Colombia’s peace builders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 269, "date": "2019-09-17.json", "name": "Pilar del CASTILLO VERA", "mepid": "28390", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Madam Representative of the Council, the implementation of the peace agreement with Colombia requires a long-term vision. It is, of course, a path full of difficulties and constant risks. That is why we need this vision and that horizon in a long perspective. I would like to stress the importance of the European Union's financial support, in particular that aimed at the areas of reintegration and rural development, and I also welcome the announcement by the High Representative of a new programme to continue to financially support those who have decided to leave arms and have been firmly maintaining that commitment. On the other hand, as the Colombian Government is doing, it is essential to strengthen measures to ensure the security of political and social leaders who are now being threatened and to bring forward and to justice those who violate peace and the law. Colombia has our full support. It is a very important trading partner for the European Union and, of course, an essential ally in the fight against climate change and the additional protection of the environment. The Security Council and the High Commissioner hem have said ⸻ and I also believe that⸻ despite all the difficulties, the implementation of the agreement is progressing. He moves forward and he does it solidly. From here I would like to congratulate and publicly acknowledge the enormous effort that President Duque and his Government are making.

In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen of the Council, I would like to draw attention to an important matter which you must deal with with the High Representative, who is not in this House today. Yesterday, the dialogue facilitated by Norway with a new ruse by Maduro, which has had only one insignificant faction of the opposition, ended in Venezuela.

Despite the difficulties in its implementation, Colombia today works to ensure that nearly fourteen thousand former guerrillas complete their return to ordinary civilian life. In the face of the killings of this and other groups, which must cease and be thoroughly investigated, there is already a protection plan that must replace the measures so far insufficient, for them and for human rights activists and journalists. Its content and early results I hope will certify that there is, on the part of the authorities, a sincere commitment to correct a problem on which the credibility of all actors depends. Colombia is also better today because, in the diagnosis of the problem and in the measures to solve it, there is a social pillar, a package of measures that articulates the 2018–2022 Plan for Equity, which is underevirated previously separate actions in various programmes and attacks one of the roots of conflict: poverty and inequality. 36% of Colombia's area housed more than three million multidimensional poor people and two and a half million victims at the beginning of the process, who added chronic public service neglect to their status. Correcting this inequality and fostering sustainable and cohesive development is another key to the success of the process. The output is complex. Unforeseen situations are added to it, such as the mass exodus of Venezuelans fleeing the Maduro regime, on whose territory farC dissidents appear to take refuge. That is why, more than ever, the European Union's political, financial and human support for peace in Colombia must be redoubled.

The first question is: among the projects that have been funded by this fund, can the Commission tell us which ones are specifically aimed at the issue of protecting human rights defenders?

But the legitimisation of one group has left a power vacuum; other militant groups and factions have emerged keen to exploit the gap in the market, particularly in cocaine. It is estimated by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime that there has been a year-on-year rise of 31% in cocaine production, estimated to be worth USD 2.7 billion.

Despite our explicit formal responsibilities in the peace agreement, our trade relations with Colombia run contrary to that peace. We import palm oil and coal under the EU—Colombia/Peru/Ecuador trade agreement because money is to be made. There’s leverage in that. Environmental rights and workers’ rights are being trampled on.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank honourable Members for their interventions, comments and suggestions. Out of the many valuable remarks, I would like to respond to MEP Arena’s question: what is the EU doing to protect human rights defenders and indigenous and social leaders?  The EU, in coordination with Member States, supports actions to help ensure that human rights defenders are protected and respected and can operate in a safe and enabling environment. Assistance is provided to defenders at risk through protection programmes such as ProtectDefenders.eu On 11 June 2019, the EU delegation together with several Member States launched the campaign ‘Defendamos la vida’ to protect and give visibility to human rights defenders and social leaders. On 10 July, the EU launched the project strengthening the Special Investigation Unit of the Office of the Attorney General of the nation, EUR two million. The Special Investigation Unit aims to implement a secure judicial investigation system able to prevent, react, control, prosecute and seek criminal punishment for grave violations against human rights defenders and members of social and political movements perpetrated by criminal organisations. And in addition, the EU will continue to provide financial support to organisations working with human rights defenders in Colombia.  From this debate I conclude that the only path towards lasting peace in this difficult context is to continue implementation of the peace agreement with full support of the EU and international stakeholders. This is our message to the government and the people of Colombia. But I would like to remind us that while the peace process remains at the heart of our engagement with Colombia, our relationship has deepened and broadened in recent years with the implementation of the free trade agreement, cooperation on security and defence, and on the environment, to mention just a few key areas. The current challenges are very serious and we will continue supporting Colombia in addressing them, but the overall relationship and perspectives for the future are very positive.

This step has been accompanied by restrictions on fundamental rights and freedoms.  The Indian Government has deployed a significant number of additional military and paramilitary troops in Kashmir and along the Line of Control. The action was presented by the Indian Government as a means to prevent violent protests. Pakistan has also deployed additional troops on its side of the Line of Control. On both sides, the issue of Kashmir resonates strongly with internal political dynamics.  While some of the restrictions are reported to have been lifted, the situation has not returned to normalcy. There have been arrests of political leaders, activists and human rights defenders. The European Union has been following the situation closely since the early days of this escalation of tensions. In early August, High Representative Mogherini spoke on the phone with both her Pakistani and Indian counterparts. In both conversations, the High Representative underlined the importance of avoiding a further escalation and stressed that dialogue between India and Pakistan through diplomatic channels is crucial.  Our position on Kashmir remains unchanged. We encourage India and Pakistan to seek a peaceful and political solution, respectful of the interests of the Kashmiri population on both sides of the Line of Control. This remains the only way to solve a long-lasting dispute that for too long has caused instability and insecurity in the region.  We remain concerned about the situation on the ground with its restrictions on fundamental freedoms. It is crucial that freedom of movement and means of communication are fully restored, as well as access to all essential services. The High Representative conveyed these concerns to the Indian Minister for External Affairs, Mr Jaishankar, during their meeting in Brussels on 13 August. The Minister debriefed the High Representative on the state of play and on the security situation. Ms Mogherini reiterated the call to avoid an escalation of tensions and stressed the importance of steps to restore the rights and freedoms of the population in Kashmir.  The EU has also raised the situation in Jammu and Kashmir at the Human Rights Council meeting in Geneva in an Item 2 Statement on 10 September. In the Statement, we encourage the lifting of the remaining restrictions temporarily imposed and to maintain the rights and fundamental freedoms of the affected population. We continue to urge both parties to engage in direct dialogue with a view to a peaceful solution in full respect of their international human rights obligations.  In a moment of rising tensions in different regions around the world, no one can afford another escalation in Kashmir. Regional cooperation in South Asia is now more essential than ever and we will continue to encourage India and Pakistan to resume dialogue and find a peaceful solution to their disputes.

Article 370 provided for greater autonomy for Indian Kashmir by giving it wide leeway and limiting the involvement of Indian legislation in the management of Jammu and Kashmir. Defence, foreign affairs and communication were the only matters under the central government of New Delhi, the rest was administered by a local legislature. Article 370 also gave the federal state a separate constitution.  Since 5 August, when India revosaes Kashmir's autonomy status, more than 3,000 people have been arbitrarily arrested, including politicians, activists and academics. All means of communication, telephone, internet, have been suspended. Emergency services and hospitals are facing a shortage of equipment and personnel. Foreign journalists and NGOs no longer have access to the territory and this situation is deteriorating with the curfew blocking the movement of premises, especially patients and doctors. Tens of thousands of soldiers have been sent to reinforce the region, which is one of the most militarized in the world with more than a million troops on the territory.  Already the UN reports published in 2018 and 2019 reported serious human rights violations against civilian populations: kidnappings, assassinations, forced displacement, sexual violence. But of course these violations were perpetrated by both Indian and Pakistani forces. The Indian Prime Minister's unilateral decision of 5 August only exacerbates this situation already on the brink of explosion.  Europe cannot remain inactive, it must advocate for an independent and transparent international investigation into the violence in Kashmir. Europe must exert its full weight in its relations with India in order to restore Kashmir to the status of autonomy that the region has enjoyed since 1950.

The EU is an organisation which proudly stands for human rights, right across the world, and we must stand today with the people of Kashmir.  The ongoing crisis in Kashmir threatens the peace and security of the wider region – one of the most volatile in the world. It’s our responsibility to do something. The recommendations of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (UNCHR)  offer a good starting point for their actions. We must support them and implement the findings of their reports, which they published last year in June and this year in July.  The institutions of the EU and their Member States exist not only to protect the human rights of citizens in the European Union, but they must also be defenders of human rights across the globe. The situation in Kashmir will not improve by trying to blame either side: all the while people try to apportion blame, the people of Kashmir are suffering and deserve better. The people of Kashmir should be the ones who decide their fate and their future. Self—determination and upholding human rights are fundamental values in our European Union, and we should demand no less from others around the world – particularly those that want to trade and have relationships with us.  The fighting in Kashmir has been going on for decades, but, in the end, the crisis is going to be ended only when people sit around the table and talk. The EU can be a natural facilitator in this role, and that allows both sides to talk. The people of Kashmir are crying out in the darkness. The EU must help them provide a light in that darkness.

The substantial funds that India has been posting for years into Kashmir have largely been stolen by a corrupt elite, and this has happened under the noses of a poor local.  The iron grip that Article 370 has kept the people of Kashmir for years has never benefited them.

It integrates the diversity of a federal order of great complexity and has ensured the coexistence of different minorities, including the Muslim minority, in a country with a majority of other religions.
