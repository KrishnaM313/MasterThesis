And in this sense, two different questions have been raised. The first, the issue of electric fishing. I would like to remind all your honorable Members that we have been working on this dossier for 21 months, with 77 meetings and a request to postpone the vote in committee in June, which was accepted. We postponed it in September and postponed it in October. It was scheduled to be voted on in December. Someone suggested that we postpone the vote and we postponed it until this time. And no one, at any time, referred to the first issue that arises today to postpone the vote: the issue of electric fishing. I mean, we've had all that time. But, in addition, what is being proposed today is to reproach the Commission for lifting a ban in 2006, that is, twelve years ago. Obviously, that does not mean that we cannot debate today and vote tomorrow. If Mr. Omarjee, as he has said, is absolutely against it and considers it an aberration, he has the possibility to vote against that article and the issue is resolved. Obviously, simply wanting to reproach the Commission for doing something in 2006 is no reason to postpone the vote. And, regarding the amendments, Mr President, the same article referred to by Mr Verhofstadt establishes that if, after returning to committee, those amendments - 92 amendments plus requests for split votes - obtained more than a third of the votes. votes, would be kept for voting in plenary. I want to say that I believe that, as close to 80% of the amendments were approved or rejected by 12-12, 13-13, 13-12, 14-12, in any case, the bulk of those amendments would go back to the Plenary because the third of the votes would be exceeded. I mean, we are not going to get anything. Electric fishing has been used as an excuse for some groups that were not satisfied or were not happy with the result of the vote In committee use the formula of table many amendments to change the text.I believe, Mr President, that there is not a single reasonable argument, because there is also nothing new in the reasons that have been put forward for postponing the text.I ask that the debate

giving me the floor: a point of order based on Rule 151 of the Rules of Procedure. On December 19, some colleagues from this Parliament - including myself - wanted to visit the Estremera prison near Madrid, where our former colleague Oriol Junqueras is imprisoned. In total there are still two leaders of a civilian movement in prison, as well as two former ministers from the Catalan government. Three of them were elected to the Catalan Parliament in the regional elections of Catalonia on December 21. For a month we formally asked to be allowed to visit the prison.

Two years ago, in Paris, we pledged to fight climate change, the greatest threat the world has ever faced. And in this fight it is vital to promote a change in the energy model, decarbonize the economy and turn towards a sustainable model that is based on renewable energies. Therefore, the European Parliament has an obligation to honor the word given to Europe, the word that Europe gave to the world, committing ourselves to promoting a new energy model based on renewables. More, if possible, after the denialist Trump has withdrawn the United States from the Paris Agreement. And we have to do it ourselves. We have to do it here, now. The Commission has fallen short in its ambition and the Council has opted for immobility, if not backwardness. Europe cannot remain in empty words, in great rhetorical statements without firm political commitment to curb climate change. Climate change knocks on our doors every day, it hits us deadly. It is urgent to act, and it is urgent to do it decisively. For this very reason, I want to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the work they have done to achieve the agreement that we have presented here today in the proposal we are debating. An agreement with which we raised the renewable target to 35% with reinforced national obligations in the Governance Regulation. We reinforce legal certainty and prevent the adoption of retroactive measures. We shield self-consumption as a right without charges, tolls or fees that impede its development. We introduce more ambition in the heating and cooling sector for greater penetration of renewables. And we are committed to the decarbonisation of transport, promoting electromobility, freezing first-generation biofuels and promoting advanced ones, in addition to excluding oil Palm. The International Renewable Energy Agency has calculated that the European Union can double its share of renewables, from 17% in 2015, to 34% in 2030, in a profitable way. Regrettably, it seems that the Member States are still blind to this reality, based on the position adopted last month by the Council. Maintaining, as the Council maintains, a renewable target of 25% is unambitious. It is also counterproductive and irresponsible. Stopping decarbonisation is stopping the development of Europe. Therefore, I call on Parliament to convey a strong, unequivocal and resounding message in favor of renewable energy, so that no one has any doubt that this House is not going to indulge in whimsy in our commitment to climate change. We have the power of the citizens' vote to change things. Let's exercise it. Responsibly, but let's exercise it.

It is a clean and cheap source of energy that can be used very quickly throughout the EU by technologies that are already available and widespread. That is why reducing consumption and reducing the energy efficiency of our economy should be one of the EU's main strategic priorities. Savings are also an integral part of the strategy to ensure Europe's long-term energy security. It is proven that any percentage improvement in energy efficiency will bring a much greater reduction in our dependence on imports. In the case of natural gas, this is up to a 2% decrease in the volume of its imports. And only if a very ambitious target is adopted will the current level of import dependence be maintained. Otherwise, if the 30% target were adopted, our dependence would increase to more than 70%. Energy efficiency also lies in the future of our economic competitiveness and our economic development. We should clearly reject the approach that efficiency is an obstacle to economic growth, that European policy in this area will only require private and public spending of hundreds of billions of euros, without any significant economic or social benefits. In my opinion, the opposite is true. If the energy efficiency target of 40% is approved, we will pave the way for an increase in both GDP and employment. In contrast, the 35% target will lead to significantly lower results, in the case of GDP even by 1.5%. Even lower results assume models for goals set at an even lower level. Similarly, a higher target will have an impact on lowering international fuel prices, on the European price of electricity and, last but not least, on the prices of emission allowances. The result will not be, as some are trying to say, that ambitious commitments for energy savings will translate into the lower competitiveness of European industry and have an overall negative impact on it. The European Commission had all this data available. Alone with them worked on the calculations of individual scenarios. She was aware of all the opportunities and benefits that energy efficiency offers. Nevertheless, of all the possible models, it ultimately opted for one of the least ambitious targets for 2030. By setting a target of 30%, maintaining a number of exemptions and flexibility in Article 7 and in many other areas, it unfortunately failed to meet the expectations of the coming decade. I must therefore ask: where does the principle of 'energy efficiency come first'? Is it left with empty declarations only? Because the facts clearly show that even 40% of the target can be achieved at an acceptable cost. Conversely, this will create new opportunities for the construction industry, for the development of energy services, because the potential for energy savings is far from being fully exploited. If less than half of the options in industry have already been exhausted, for example in the case of buildings, 80% of the potential is still untapped. It is in buildings that significant changes can be achieved at a reasonable cost. By accelerating the renovation of European buildings, we will not only achieve a long-term reduction in energy consumption, but we will also help to address the most pressing issues of energy poverty. Today, millions of Europeans have great difficulty paying money for heat, energy or gas. Very often they also live in flats that are not properly heated or that are unhealthy due to poor heating and ventilation. In addition, any percentage improvement in energy efficiency will help these households pay their energy bills. Finally, I would like to emphasize that, by signing the Paris Climate Agreement, we have committed ourselves to taking measures that will lead to a significant reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, so as not to increase the average temperature by two degrees Celsius. Energy savings should make a significant contribution to this. However, the proposal presented by the European Commission is very far from this. Great results require great ambitions. I believe that we will be ambitious enough to achieve such results in the case energy efficiency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 20, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Michèle RIVASI", "mepid": "96743", "text": "rapporteur. - Mr President, what will happen in this vote is very important, because it is really consistency between the commitment of the European Union and the Member States vis-à-vis the agreement of Paris and our legislation, and that is why we need ambition and consistency. It was therefore necessary to have a European framework law on climate and energy. These are therefore important objectives and we defined these objectives with a vision, I would say, for 2050. We introduced the concept of a carbon budget, that is to say what can still be emitted into the atmosphere. to comply with the Paris agreement and see after what remains on the contribution of the European Union. If the European Union becomes a low-carbon economy with net zero energy consumption by 2050 at the latest, it has two major levers, energy efficiency and renewable energies, and I agree with my fellow co-rapporteurs who say that the Commission is not sufficiently ambitious, and neither are the Member States, moreover, to be consistent with the Paris agreements. Likewise, what was interesting - I hope my colleagues will support it - is that we introduced, precisely, the fact that the Commission is developing a comprehensive strategy for methane, because it has a very high global warming potential and that, over five years, for example, a ton of methane does as much damage as 101 tons of CO2, so it's very important to integrate it. Now, on the method: how do you set these goals to music by first developing integrated national energy and climate plans for 2030 every five years, with a perspective every ten years? We know that some states are quite hostile to it, but it is very important to encourage it. Likewise, there must be transparency. We need to develop a permanent platform for dialogue to involve the different layers of society, because if we don't involve partners, communities or civil society, we won't get there. Knowing that the objectives are defined by sectoral legislation, whether it is the directive on renewable energies, on energy efficiency, or on buildings, the report on governance refers to linear trajectories for the deployment of renewable energies and energy efficiency over the next decade, and when you look at it, that's a plus for everything. This is a plus for the security of investments, for job creation and for responding to fuel poverty. However, this can only be done if the objectives are binding, when it is precisely here that the Member States are not in favor; It is therefore important that MEPs encourage this European policy so that these objectives are achieved. And if the European Union or a member state deviates from its path, we need to have a recovery mechanism in place, a kind of toolbox for achieving these objectives. I am therefore counting on my colleagues, because we cannot say, on the one hand, that the European Union is somewhat of a leader in terms of the climate, then, from the point of view of legislation, to be below the objectives set by the Paris agreements.

Whether we are giving Sunday speeches that we will forget on Wednesday when we vote. It's about two things: One is ambition. Anyone who deals with Paris, with climate protection and modalizes knowledge, knows that 27% renewables, 30% efficiency will lead to the fact that in the next decade Europe will blow so much CO2 emissions into the atmosphere that we will then - to stay in our carbon budget - would have to be zero by 2030 to 2040, which is impossible. That means: We need more ambitions in the votes on renewables and efficiency, otherwise we have actually already given up the “target below 2 degrees”. The other is the frame. And what Michèle has set out, what we have tried to do in our joint report, is to get the EU to build these very bridges where there are still holes and not enough bridges to the Paris Agreement. Paris has a reporting requirement every five years. We are at ten in Europe and we are now trying to make reports every five years so that Europe is coherent internally and externally. Paris also says: Every report actually has to focus more on climate protection, in English we say ratcheting up - this is also not provided for in current EU legislation. In order to make it clear to the people outside and to the economy outside what it's all about, we need a clear target for 2050. That is why we demand a net zero 2050: 2050 will be zero. If we do not do that - and there is an amendment from the PPE which says: We want to be like in the Paris Agreement. What does that mean? Net zero would make it clear to everyone that by 2050 the last oil and gas heating system must have disappeared, that by 2050 the cars and all transport must function without CO2, and the electricity much earlier anyway. That means: Without a clear indication of where we want to go, how do we want to achieve that society, the people outside, the economy fully recognize this challenge? So one thing is this framework. But because, unfortunately, in the report on renewables, we have given up the nationally binding targets that I have always defended as rapporteur - which is of course a simple, unbureaucratic instrument for getting governments to expand renewables - because we have given up on that In governance, we now have to deal with the question of what it means when we have set 35% renewables as the target at European level, and how we can then put that into such a corset the national governments deliver that? That is why we have designed Article 27 in detail and stretched it wider than what the Commission had drafted. One last thing - keyword energy poverty. We've been talking about it for years. Now we have done it - and I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs from the Liberals and the EPP - that for the first time we have a binding text, according to which the governments who suffer from energy poverty at home now also take measures in their national plans Need to seize energy poverty.

Thanks to the strong position taken by the European Parliament, we saw a political agreement that allowed us to maintain the ambition of the Commission’s original proposal on most aspects and even went further than them on many points.   Turning to the three proposals being debated here today, I would first like to address the proposal on governance. It is clear that strong governance rules will be a crucial for ensuring a resilient Energy Union with ambitious energy and climate policies and for making sure that the whole Clean Energy Package sticks together. We need a reliable approach to governance at European level, notably to ensure the effective achievement of the European Union’s 2030 targets for energy and climate. It is essential to provide a solid system that allows progress to be assessed at European Union level, to put in place specific measures to identify shortcomings at an early stage, and to respond adequately in order to close any potential gap. This will be vital in securing the necessary public and private investment. The Commission welcomes the European Parliament’s ambitions to establish effective and reliable governance for the Energy Union. The report adopted by the joint ITRE/ENVI Committee contains several positive elements that will help to keep such an ambitious approach when trilogues with the Council start. Coherence is one of the central assets of the Clean Energy Package, and it is of paramount importance to continue paying particular attention to this in the work ahead. In this regard, the Commission welcomes your decision to set sectoral targets in sectoral legislation but, nevertheless, the mechanisms securing target achievement should remain in the governance proposal. At the same time, the Commission welcomes the latest proposal tabled on the trajectories to be followed by Member States to reach their 2030 national renewables targets and trusts that it will be supported across the House. We believe that it will be a very positive step forward, laying the ground for a solid agreement in the negotiations with the Council, which has made a major step by accepting the introduction of a third reference point, in 2027, on the trajectory towards the 2030 renewables target. Finding a common ground on this will be an essential element showcasing our commitment towards achieving the energy transition. To keep a coherent and integrated approach, a single Energy Union Committee for the implementation of the regulation, across all dimensions, is also essential. Co-existence of two separate committees would not be the optimal solution because of the many linkages between energy and climate, and it would blur clarity about competence. A single committee would create the necessary synergies and ensure a more coherent and integrated framework. It is in line with better regulation principles, streamlines structures and cuts red tape. We further encourage the European Parliament to keep an ambitious position on the deadlines for the draft national plans, which are important to guarantee the effectiveness of the iterative process, to convey early investment signals to the markets and investors, as well as for the Facilitative ‘Talanoa’ Dialogue under the Paris Climate Agreement. Citizens are at the centre of the clean energy transition. Consumers are becoming the real drivers of this energy transition, and this is well reflected in the emphasis put by the Parliament on the role of citizens and civil society in taking part in the process leading to the definition of climate and energy policies. Finally, we also need to promote additional efforts to tackle energy poverty in Europe. The Clean Energy Package proposes several measures contributing to the alleviation of energy poverty, but I welcome that the European Parliament has recognised the importance of this by strengthening the efforts to be made by Member States to reduce energy poverty.  Let me turn now to the proposed revisions to the Renewable Energy Directive. The aim of our regulatory framework is to ensure a continuous flow of investments into renewable sectors and to ensure its competitive development for the benefit of our citizens and our industry. The Commission welcomes the progressive position of the European Parliament, which is generally reinforcing the overall ambition of the proposal, including on such key aspects as consumer empowerment, administrative simplification and investor stability and predictability. Overall, I believe the text adopted in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy is a reasonable compromise which takes into account the different positions across the European Parliament and reinforces the proposal for a directive. However, specifically regarding the amendments that have been tabled to plenary, I see some merits on those tabled in relation to the cap on conventional biofuels, which establish national caps instead of a Union cap. This could be a compromise in a very divisive issue that brings the text closer to the balanced approach that the Commission initially proposed.  Another issue is the harmonisation of the sustainability criteria for bioenergy, where the text adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety would lead to contradictory interpretations, potentially opening the door to the introduction of national criteria. We need to make sure that we keep the European Union harmonisation of these criteria, which already exists under the current Directive, so that there is no detrimental effect for the internal market. Finally, I would like to underline our concern regarding the amendment tabled to exclude roundwood and stumps from bioenergy raw material. Excluding these feedstocks by default is neither environmentally desirable nor practical, as it would require all forest biomass used in the energy sector to be certified. We count on the Parliament to support an ambitious report on Wednesday and to work with us for the best outcome on the proposal, considering the general approach adopted by Council in December. Let me now address the Energy Efficiency Directive. It is crucial that Parliament maintains its position on an ambitious energy efficiency level, including the binding character of the European Union target and the strong Article 7. These are key elements, not only for reducing key energy consumption, improving competitiveness, strengthening our energy security, improving air quality and quality of life, and reducing energy poverty, but also in the context of achieving our climate objectives. I am glad to see a compromise emerging around a high ambition level, supported by a strong Article 7. It is a comfortable position for the European Parliament in view of entering into interinstitutional negotiations. Indeed, analyses show that the majority of measures under Article 7 – aims of the renovation of buildings through energy efficiency obligation schemes, fiscal incentives or financing schemes – will deliver real benefits to the consumer in the form of reduced energy bills. Without maintaining a strong Article 7, many profitable energy savings will not take place in the next decade. I would like to warn against two specific proposals. First, even if it is decided politically to introduce an ‘adjustment factor’ for the level of the European energy efficiency target, this factor should certainly not be linked to the level of renewable energy consumption. Renewable energy and energy efficiency are partners, not rivals. Second, we will not be able to maintain a strong Article 7 if we allow excess energy savings from the current period to be carried forward after 2020. This would open a significant loophole and would force the Commission into a position where it would need to intrusively monitor the details of implementation in Member States. Finally, you also proposed to amend a number of other articles which are not part of the Commission proposal. Opening new articles without a proper assessment by the Commission and without the Council taking position entails the risk of significantly delaying the negotiations and sending the wrong signal to stakeholders.  I look forward to this debate on these two different proposals but, before we start, let me remind you again that these are part of a bigger package and, while considering these proposals individually, it is vital that you do not lose sight of the need for coherence and maintaining a high level of ambition. I encourage you now to move forward as soon as possible in debating and voting on the market design proposals in order to complete the whole package.

Well, science companies, together with Bertrand Piccard, have done that. And how did they do it? They tried to get energy on the aeroplane as low as possible and, as it were, threw away everything that was not necessary. So you had a very energy-efficient aeroplane and then it could fly on solar. And that is the philosophy which we need to apply when we vote on Wednesday. Make sure that we have a very high level of energy efficiency, and then it is possible to achieve a high level of renewables, of which in the long run – though not too long –  we will need 100%. That is why I am very proud of my political group with two excellent rapporteurs on energy efficiency and renewables. We fought for the 40%, and I still hope that we can achieve a majority in Parliament in favour because this not only goes together with our achievements and our commitment to the Paris Agreement, but it is also something that can boost our economy, create jobs and ensure that energy poverty is tackled – which is also something very important to my political group.

One concerns EU anti-pollution regulations, which exist for all sectors but not for geothermal energy. In Italy, the mercury emissions of the 34 geothermal plants, for example, according to the only official data available for the Tuscany region, are equal to 1.5 tons of mercury per year. The Union banned classical thermometers which contained just two grams each; therefore it is as if around the Italian geothermal power plants, in a small area, 750,000 thermometers break every year. In the same year, 16,000 tons of hydrogen sulphide and 6,000 tons of ammonia are released into the atmosphere. These quantities are not even included in the Union inventories of polluting emissions. In addition, some types of geothermal power plants, in their life cycle, emit more greenhouse gases than fossil gas plants of the same power, but take incentives for EU climate objectives. For the Union, it is as if geothermal energy with a high environmental impact did not exist: a great regulatory vacuum and a paradox that we have a duty to start filling.

The clean energy package is an important building block for a successful energy transition and for achieving climate goals.

It is all the more important that these requirements can also be implemented, and the present 2030 target bundle of 40% greenhouse gas reduction, an improvement in energy efficiency by 40% and an increase in the share of renewable energies to 35% can hardly be implemented from today's perspective. And if so, then only with investments in the four-digit billion range, which are at the expense of the competitiveness of European companies, hamper economic growth and endanger security of supply. A current study by the BDI confirms this for German industry. The tight vote in the ITRE committee on the energy efficiency directive has shown that there is no clear consensus in Parliament with regard to the new climate targets either. Increasing energy efficiency to 40% by 2030 is neither economically nor technically feasible. This is confirmed by an impact assessment by the Commission. Raising the target to 40% would require additional investment of around EUR 500 billion and increase the overall system by EUR 125 billion by 2030. However, efficiency gains are increasingly difficult to achieve with efficiency and therefore cannot be controlled at will.

You yourself tabled an amendment that made 30% binding, and today you are calling for 40% in plenary. Do you actually have a look yourself at what the S&D is asking for? At least we don't. A forty percent savings target, as decided by the Industry Committee, is now unrealistic. Firstly, that would undermine emissions trading, and a forty percent saving target would also apply to renewable energies, and secondly, that would counteract the structural change to electromobility and also to electric heat pumps in buildings. Therefore, support the more moderate savings targets, move away from the rigid renovation quotas for the municipalities and also agree to the adjustment to the development of renewables. The better they develop, the fewer savings we have to make. One more word about Mr. Turmes.

Friends of the Earth has estimated that 125 million Europeans live in energy poverty, and we know that energy poverty disproportionately affects our most vulnerable people. Our poorest live in the leakiest houses: single-parent households, older people, the long-term sick and children. Three out of four buildings in Europe are energy-inefficient, and account for 36% of our emissions. It is vital that we set a binding energy-efficiency target of 40%. For every 1% target increase, three million homes can be renovated and seven million people lifted out of energy poverty. Forty per cent – not 35 – is 35 million extra people. On 29 January 2017, we launched the European Energy Poverty Observatory. Energy efficiency is the first fuel, and with the 40% binding energy efficiency target and greater ambition on renewables we can lift people out of energy poverty. We can tackle climate change and halve our emissions and have cleaner air. We can put energy efficiency as the driver of jobs and growth. I call on every group to vote for the strongest possible measures for clean energy for the benefit of all our citizens, especially our energy poor.

But Europe has three major problems with energy: 1) the price; 2) it is still much too polluting; 3) we are too dependent on imports from outside Europe. Let's face it: 2017 was the year we imported more gas from Russia than ever before. The solution is the same for all three problems: energy savings and an enormous input of renewable energy. That is the way forward! Is Europe aware of this sufficiently? As Seán Kelly said: will Europe indeed become the renewable capital of the world? Not if we start from the Commission proposal or the rather weak behavior of the Council so far. I look at countries like China, but also the United States - even under President Trump: they are moving much faster than Europe. And India also has a much higher growth in this area than Europe. It's unprecedented. So if we as Europe want to move forward in this area, become energy independent, want a lower energy price and also want to stay within the Paris climate goals, more ambition is really needed.

We all know it is a pure illusion to believe that these objectives will help Europe’s energy independence by enhancing energy security and energy supply whilst increasing job opportunities. In fact, intermittent renewable energy sources, such as wind power, are unreliable: they create temporary green jobs. Indeed, a study by the Spanish Professor Gabriel Calzada, of Juan Carlos University, shows that every green job created costs 2.2 real jobs in the real economy. This happens by diverting resources from efficient industries into highly inefficient green projects and by raising the cost of electricity for the rest of the economy. Many of the green jobs were temporary and in almost every case, the subsidy necessary to create a green job exceeded the annual salary.

I am pleased to see that Members have acknowledged the importance of these three issues in enabling Europe to drive the clean energy transition. I also reiterate that the three dossiers are strongly inter-linked and that Parliament must remain coherent in its approach, and that the rules that we agree must be ambitious and workable in practice. On governance, I was surprised that some honourable Members expressed the view that the governance initiative will undermine the Member States’ right to choose their energy mix. The opposite is true. The basic rationale of the initiative is to fully respect the principle of subsidiarity and the balance between the European Union and Member States in the area of energy. This is reflected in the approach, which is through national plans set out at national level rather than plans being imposed at European Union level. That is why the governance proposal is such an important proposal. Some of you have also questioned, or raised doubts, on whether this proposal will be strong enough to ensure that the 2030 targets are met. My initial reaction is that the Commission proposal was established in order to achieve those targets, but Parliament has improved the proposal and these gains are to its credit. Parliament has analysed the proposal, has considered the weaknesses it may have, and has reinforced it accordingly. I think that jointly, with the basic proposal of the Commission and the improvements that Parliament has introduced, we have a very important tool to make sure that the targets that we establish are achieved. Because the overall majority has been in favour of more ambitious targets than those proposed by the Commission we are at a very good starting position for the trilogues that are going to be extremely complex. Without our good-governance proposal, all the rest is meaningless. Today I want to thank the rapporteurs for their efforts. They have done excellent work. It is a very difficult exercise, and on Wednesday we will have difficult votes, but lots of work is now behind us, and the Commission wants to give thanks for all the effort made. Coming back to renewables, let me say that overall the compromise text that is emerging in Parliament also represents a very good negotiating position for Parliament in view of the trilogues. Mr Blanco López has done excellent work, as has Mr Turmes and, certainly, Ms Rivasi. I see broad support for a high overall level of ambition for renewables deployment in Europe, including the importance of Europeanising renewables policy and strengthening investor certainty in this context. The regulatory framework that you are putting in place should enable greater cost-effectiveness and the sustained deployment of renewables in our electricity sector, in buildings and in the transport sector. On energy efficiency, I want to reiterate again the importance of maintaining a high level of ambition for Article 7 to enable economically viable energy savings to be made over the next decade. How can we say that we want to do more to encourage energy efficiency if, at the same time, we undermine the best instrument we have, which is Article 7. So there is a contradiction sometimes, and we have to solve that. I expect that Wednesday’s vote will solve these contradictions. The debate on energy efficiency also showed strong support for a high level of ambition for energy efficiency and a strong Article 7. That’s very positive. If you see what happened in the October 2014 Council, when energy efficiency was proposed at a level of 27, the Commission acknowledged that this was not enough and then proposed a binding level of 30. Now you are proposing higher levels, and the trilogues will be complicated and the Commission will act as honest broker to get the best final energy-efficiency proposal. There have been some more comments, particularly Professor Gierek, who consistently drew attention to the need for a life-cycle method to calculate energy use. I agree that this is relevant both for policy analysis and for policies like ecodesign that look at particular products. But if we apply it to the whole energy system it will cause problems such as double counting of energy use, so the Commission prefers to keep the Eurostat method for calculating energy efficiency. Just a final comment to Mr Jávor. It is true that the media has said that there is a draft procedural report, but the final report is going to be released in October 2018. The final IPCC report is a very important input to the Talanoa dialogue and for the preparations in the run-up to COP24 in Katowice. But the Commission will wait to see the final report to take the appropriate conclusions once the report is fully approved. I will just finalise by thanking all of the House for supporting these three pieces of legislation which are central to setting the new regulatory framework for the clean energy transition and for delivering our Paris Agreement commitments. This week’s votes will finalise Parliament’s position on these issues and will be an important point of reference that will establish the pathways to a final agreement with the Council. In the climate package with the emissions trading system, land use change and forestry we have been able to secure very complicated agreements.

On the contrary, it is a factor for growth, competitiveness, job creation and quality job creation.

And knowing, ladies and gentlemen, the Council's proposal, I would like to appeal to further strengthen Parliament's proposal with a clear and forceful vote to overcome the obstacles that we still have to achieve that objective of making a commitment to clean energy, to make a commitment to renewable energy. I already know that we all have nuances, we all have national interests, we all have something to do with a sector that is very important in our country, and we have doubts. But the challenge ahead of us cannot generate any doubts. We cannot follow deniers like Trump, who deny what we have above us. We have to have a high view and we have to respond as Parliament to this appointment with history.

It is also the most effective solution to energy poverty. For these reasons, we should take very ambitious measures to promote energy efficiency. The Energy Committee did so in December last year. It turns out that accepting a 40% commitment will have relatively great benefits for the European economy and businesses, despite the high costs. In the case of buildings, we know that it is in this sector that there is great potential for savings, which we have so far used only 20%. That is why it is important that we keep Article 5. We also need a very strong Article 7, because the amount of exemptions and flexibility that Member States use then brings only 0.75% savings instead of the expected 1.5%.

I've heard a lot about the targets: 35%, 40%, whether it's energy efficiency or renewables. I think we have to be very ambitious on this issue because, on the one hand, there will be a trialogue and we will still come up against positions that can be very different from a Member State to the other, therefore, we must be ambitious, and, on the other hand, we have everything to gain. Indeed, if we are ambitious on renewable energies, we can really have a renewable energy industry in Europe, which means employment and less dependence on other fossil fuels. As for energy efficiency, the more ambitious we are, the more we can respond to innovation, which is still a characteristic of Europe, and to fuel poverty. Therefore, in this discussion on goals, let's be ambitious to respond to COP 21. Then, I find that perhaps we haven't discussed enough about governance itself, because everything is going to depend on national plans. that the States will propose, the evaluation of these plans and the possibility of redressing the situation if, in 2020, we feel that the trajectories will not be up to par. We will have to be very firm on prices so that there is a commitment from the Member States, so that the Commission can assess national plans and that the bar can be raised, if ever it is impossible to achieve these objectives.

Ambition and realism - Ambition must mean on Wednesday: at least 35% renewables, at least 35% energy efficiency, without the weakening suggested by Mr Pieper that if we do more than ICT, less efficiency would be necessary, or if we do more renewables, too less efficiency, and a strong Article 7. Maybe also an appeal to the PPE, which has already done a good job on renewables, we can get there on efficiency. We need a clear goal in governance. If we tell the citizens and industry in Europe that we want to be at net zero by 2050, then we will create a clear goal. Carlos Moedas, our Commissioner for Research, wants to innovate with a clear goal: Mission Zero - Mission Zero 2050, and that is why I would be happy if the EPP also voted on Wednesday so that we don't have some shaky outlook, which would be: with Paris compatible, but a clear net zero goal.

The deployment of renewable energies in the Union is hampered by complex administrative procedures which require long waiting times. Shorter deadlines are therefore needed for smaller projects, the implementation of which does not require the same thorough consultation and assessment as for larger installations.

It is relevant what kind of raw materials are used to achieve the target level of renewable energy. Using tall oil as a raw material for biofuels does not make sense for the climate. Tall oil is not a waste but a raw material that can be used for higher value-added products. At the same time, new jobs can be created and economic growth promoted. We should be critical of raw materials that, in direct energy use, release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere. Hundreds of scientists worldwide have argued for it. I hope that the waste hierarchy will be applied to the use of forest biomass. For example, wood can first be used for higher value-added products, in which case it sequesters carbon longer and only then is it used for energy production or as a biofuel. In a functioning circular economy, the application of the waste hierarchy does not pose any problems.

Mr President, dear Commissioner, my first words must necessarily be of gratitude to all those who during this time have worked so that finally today we are debating this important dossier, many times from totally different points of view, but always with great spirit constructive. It has been almost 21 months of work, 77 meetings and many hours of debate with the Commission, with the Council, with fishermen, with NGOs and with all those who have wanted to join this challenge. Because it is a challenge to face a dossier such as the technical measures that regulate how, when and where fishermen can operate and that has already had two failed attempts to review. And this challenge is complicated when we want a regulation to encompass more than 30 provisions, some of them based on legislation dating from 1998 and which has become over time a complex, impractical and very rigid system of rules. But no one doubts that it is necessary to review technical measures. And nobody doubts that it is necessary and urgent to try it soon, since Brexit is approaching, but also the end of this parliamentary mandate. My goal, and I think everyone's, was simplification, without reinventing rules, but making them more understandable and viable for operators and administrations, through regionalization and results-based management, which gives fishermen greater flexibility and brings decision-making closer to the regions and local specificities, while maintaining the guidelines, so that we offer the sector equal conditions and rules that are adapted to the reality of each fishery and each marine basin, and thus, at the same time, the institutions of the European Union do not lose control of the most important characteristics of technical measures. I believe that all these objectives are reflected in the commitments reached, in which we have taken into account the The hard work that the Commission has had with the Council for a long time, and that is why I ask that during the vote we keep the commitments as they were adopted by the Commission. This is precisely why I believe - because a lot of work was done and I think well - that the package of commitments is very balanced. Regarding the objectives, something that worries the Commission and also us, the compromise that I proposed and adopted in the Committee on Fisheries is ambitious and balanced. It includes a progressive reduction in catches of small fish as the main objective of future regulation on technical measures, leaving it to Member States or the Commission, if Member States do not adopt joint recommendations within a limited time frame, with the best possible advice to establish key fisheries. And, if the reduction in juvenile catches is not accompanied, as some claim, by a percentage of concrete figures, it is not due to a lack of ambition, but rather because of the need to be more pragmatic and take into account the realities of each fishery in a given fishery. basin. Regionalization will play a key role in setting measurable targets and the Commission will be no stranger to this process. Rather than an arbitrary or symbolic figure, the compromise seeks tailor-made, scientifically and operational-based targets, tailored to each fishery. The Commission asserts that the absence of a quantified target will create unequal situations in the various basins of the European Union. I think the main thing is to set realistic goals because there is no greater injustice than imposing the same rules for different situations. Finally, in recent days a new front has been opened that has polarized positions and created divisions in the various groups. An attempt has been made to paralyze the dossier and the debate has been monopolized, leaving aside very important issues, only around electric fishing. There are who try to, thinking of twelve years ago, change what was done then.I believe that it is a controversial issue, that there are defenders and detractors, but regardless of maximalist positions, the amendment or compromise that is offered is a compromise that I sincerely believe meets the objectives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 120, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, my colleague Mr Mato, his team and the Committee on Fisheries (PECH) for the work done to achieve the report on our proposal for a new technical measures framework. Regulating technical measures is about setting out how fishermen can go about their work at sea – what gears to use, what specifications to meet and which standards to strive for. It is therefore a key element of how our common fisheries policy operates on the ground. The current legal framework is quite old and no longer in line with the ambitious objectives of our reform policy in terms of greater sustainability, as Mr Mato said.  I welcome Parliament’s position, which embraces key elements of the Commission’s proposal, including a firm rejection of reinstating the existing complex array of technical rules and support for the Commission’s proposal on measures to protect sensitive species and habitats. We also welcome the PECH Committee’s approach on how regionalisation would work in the context of technical measures. However, I would like to take this opportunity to discuss several areas of concern. This is the third attempt to reform technical measures legislation, and our proposal was based on the concept of results—based management and accountability by the operators. This was proposed to deliver simplification and flexibility to amend technical regulations at a regional level, while retaining oversight and minimum standards by setting quantitative objectives. I have to express my disappointment in the fact that the clear and measurable EU targets included in the Commission’s proposals have been deleted in the draft EP’s report. These targets would introduce accountability and be the basic measuring stick for results—based management. It is a fundamental element of the Commission’s proposal, and its deletion risks emptying the proposal of much of its intended purpose. For example, the draft report introduces compromise amendments to regionalise the rules governing the use of different mesh sizes. With no EU quantitative objectives and targets, there is no way to ensure that regional rules will deliver greater sustainability and selectivity in line with the CFP goals. The deletion of EU targets therefore represents a major concern about how regionalisation may work in practice. We no longer have common objectives across Union waters. We therefore run an unacceptable risk of having an uneven application of a common policy between different areas, and of having different level playing fields between our fishermen. This is of significant concern, as it undermines the core principle of the CFP.  My second concern relates to the EU landing obligation. The reform of the CFP aims at gradually eliminating the wasteful practice of discards through the introduction of the landing obligation. This radical change in fisheries management aims to improve fishing behaviour through improvements in selectivity. Amendment 136 essentially introduces a derogation from the landing obligation on the condition that all catches are fully documented. Here I would like to point out that the obligation to fully document catches is already a legal requirement. In effect, this amendment would provide an exemption from a key element of the CFP. If this amendment is passed, it will significantly undermine the incentive for fishermen to improve selectivity.  I am also aware of the discussions surrounding the issue of electro-pulse fishing, and I would like to remind you that the current technical regulations permit the use of electro-pulse fishing on a limited basis. In our proposal we have proposed to remove the five-percent limit, but to retain the geographical restrictions to the southern North Sea. This is based on advice from both the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) in 2012 and ICES in 2016. ICES, for instance, considers that the conventional way of fishing by beam trawling has a negative impact on ecosystems, while electric pulse stimulation, if properly controlled and applied, may offer a more ecologically benign alternative way of fishing by reducing unwanted by-catch, reducing seabed damage and lowering CO2 emissions.  There are other elements in the report that are problematic, such as amendments that weaken existing provisions – to protect sensitive habitats in the Mediterranean, for example – or amendments that dilute measures to protect vulnerable deep—water sharks and other vulnerable species of marine mammals and reptiles, but the specific issues I raised earlier – that is the removal of Union—wide quantitative targets and the blanket derogation from the landing obligation – would seriously undermine the Commission’s original proposal and key elements of the CFP. Therefore, I have to be very clear that Amendments 52—60, 68 and 171 are unacceptable for the Commission, as these would remove common targets. Equally unacceptable are Amendments 130, 131 and 136, as these would undermine the landing obligation. We therefore count on your support to ensure that the CFP delivers on its key objectives through a meaningful revision of the technical measures guiding fishing activities.

Achieving the maximum sustainable yield of the activity requires both moving away from utopia and recognizing that fishing activity, including its professionals, must also be seen as part of the system to be protected. The complexity, dispersion and contradictions of the norms that we are reviewing have their origin precisely in a partial vision based on one or another sensibility. Scientists support the establishment of a percentage of juvenile catches and a deadline to achieve it, nuanced with the possibilities of regional adjustments if justified by data, as proposed by my group's amendment. By innovating it is possible to increase selectivity. There is no better stimulus to advance the creation of new fishing gear and techniques than by setting prudent targets. Along these lines, and for the same reasons, I am inclined to maintain the current status quo of electric fishing, that is, a four-year trial period for up to 5% of the fleet, but including the North Sea and guaranteeing the scientific access to vessels, prohibiting the use of complementary accessories such as ticklers and verifying that discards are reduced, reporting areas, captures and voltages.

Electro-pulse is a technique that is blamed for breaking the backs of cod, eradicating molluscs and gastropods, causing internal bleeding and leaving the marine environment a dessert. Already banned in China and other parts of the world for being too damaging to the ecology, electro-pulse fishing must now also be outlawed, as per the 1990 EU ban on fishing with electricity, explosives and poisons. In recent weeks we’ve seen a lot of propaganda outlining the supposed environmental credentials of electro-pulse fishing, but the fact is that little independent non-partisan science has been completed. In the 13 studies conducted since electro-pulse was allowed, only three have looked at the effects on the marine environment. These three studies showed that 50% to 70% of the large cod caught with electricity had their spine broken and internal haemorrhages, that the survival rate of undersize discarded fish is very small, and that electrical currents may result in a weakened immune system for invertebrates. As for the claim that electro-pulse fishing is better for the sea bed, this is also a fallacy. Rather than gliding about the sea bed, pulse trawls are heavy rigs that penetrate the sediment by 6 cm with electrodes blasting 50 volts of electricity of an intensity of 60 amps killing everything in their path. The fact is, other than a small reduction in overall fuel usage there is no environmental benefit. Yet there is growing empirical and anecdotal evidence that electro-pulse fishing is doing catastrophic damage to Europe’s marine environment, fishes and fishing communities.

I have taken due note of this very interesting debate. On a positive note, we all agree on the need to have this review of the technical measures, which is a very good start. Let me now turn to some of the specific points raised by Member States. The first point that I would like to make is that Parliament has focused on electro-pulse fishing, and this is also a good discussion. However, we should not lose sight of the other important elements contained in the proposal, as well as other problematic amendments. Whilst the Commission is aware of the concerns being expressed regarding pulse fishing, it is important that we all recall and keep an eye on the broader perspective as well. Mr Affronte and Ms Briano spoke on the issue of regionalisation, and obviously we are all in favour of regionalisation, but in this specific case an amendment introduces the possibility of regionalising the specific rules governing the use of different mesh sizes, for example. In practice, there would no longer be a common objective across Union waters. One comment with regards to Croatia, which wants to have a special derogation for purse seine nets. This goes against a well-established rule from the 2006 Mediterranean Regulation, and allowing for a derogation would undermine conservation standards in the Adriatic. With regards to the Turkish coastguard issue that to Mr Marias mentioned, I will look into this and come back to him as well. A number of you, and Mr Ricardo in particular, have mentioned the issue of targets and quantitative targets. What I have to say is that the concept of quantitative targets introduced in the Commission proposal is a new approach and is intended to allow for the concept of results-based management and accountability by the operators. This was proposed to deliver simplification and flexibility to amend technical regulations at a regional level while retaining oversight through the setting of quantitative of objectives. This would avoid the need to prescribe and micro-manage the specific details of how, where and when a fisherman operates by focusing on the outcome. The alternative proposed by the Committee on Fisheries (PECH) would mean that quantitative reductions are set by different regional groups, and this could lead to a differentiated approach and divergent standards across sea basins. As I said, most of the speakers spoke about pulse fishing, and we note the concerns raised by a number of MEPs, as well as NGOs outside this House, regarding the use of pulse fishing. Our proposal lifts the current capacity limits on the number of vessels that can use the technique, but we have proposed to limit its use to the southern North Sea, in line with existing provisions. Contrary to what MEP Hookem said, we do have independent scientific assessments, and according to our independent scientific assessments, the conventional way of fishing by beam trawling has proven to have a negative impact on the ecosystem. Thus, it is important to remember what pulse fishing would be replacing, and that is traditional beam trawling. If properly controlled and applied, I underline these words, electric pulse simulation may offer a more ecologically benign alternative way of fishing by reducing unwanted by-catch, reducing seabed damage and lowering CO2 emissions. Following independent scientific advice, the Commission has retained the geographical limitations... (Mr Jadot interrupted and President intervened) So that this fishing technique can only be used in the southern North Sea. I could not accept the comment by Mr Jadot, where he said that I was lying. I can assure you that lying is not in my nature and that I have no interest whatsoever in doing so. If I am lying, that means that our scientific advice is lying as well. In its advice of 2012, the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) concluded that most ecological concerns raised by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) have been adequately addressed. Subsequently, advice from ICES in 2016 concluded that – and I will quote – conventional beam trawling has significant and well demonstrated negative economic ecosystem impacts. If properly understood and adequately controlled, electric power stimulation may offer a more ecologically benign alternative and could reduce fishing mortality on more targets species. This is not what I am saying, that is what our independent scientific advice is saying. Let me reiterate, it is of the utmost importance that in order to move away from the current complexities of technical rules in return for a less prescriptive and results-oriented approach, it is important and it is essential that we retain common measures and objectives. Secondly, it is essential that we do not go back on our commitments under the Common Fisheries Policy to reduce unwanted catches and prohibit discards, as this was a central element of the Common Fisheries Policy that we all signed up for. In the spirit that Mr Kelly mentioned, I look forward to further working with the Parliament in a good spirit of cooperation, and hopefully we can take this file forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 1, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 149, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "speaker. - Mr. president; Thank you very much to everyone, to those who have supported and to those who not so much. In any case, it is very difficult to answer them all in two minutes, but I would like to say that there is something that I share with the commissioner. Dear Commissioner, unfortunately electric fishing has completely distorted this debate. There are very important things in this dossier, even more important or let's say the same. But, of course, I sincerely believe that it has been distorted, and I am deeply sorry. Simply saying without passion that the proposal we have made I think is balanced, that it is not an arbitrary decision, but that it will be based on scientific studies in any case. And, dear Commissioner, as many times as I say that we are going to eliminate the targets, it is not true. Targets are not going to be removed. We eliminate the quantified objectives in advance, subjectively and without a criterion. And we do eliminate those, because, even though you say that good management will be called into question, I believe in good management that comes from regionalization. You presume that states and regions will not adopt the regulation itself well. I think they will do well. And, of course, regionalization is not anarchy, as has been said here. There are going to be quantifiable goals, Commissioner. You know it. And there will be them in a year, if they agree, or in a year plus six months if they don't and the Commission itself will do it. But they will be goals that take into account the specificities of each fishery and each basin. That's bad? I think you bet on regionalization, but less, now less. And as for the size of the mesh, what they wanted was to end the status quo, which would radically change what there was from one day to the next. And we continue to bet on that for regionalization: different basins, different fisheries. And you did too and have been working with the Council for many months in this line. And of Suddenly everything has changedWhat has served, now stops serving.I honestly don't get it.Commissioner, we are going to work in the future, and we are going to do it well.And surely we will reach agreements.And I just finished.Commitments must be made.We all gave in.Let's vote.Let's support it.Fishermen want new technical measures that can be used, that are regionalized.And our obligation is not to disappoint them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 150, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  The debate is closed.

The Commission should perhaps have taken into consideration the complexities encountered by the operators, who live in the fishing industry on a daily basis, acting accordingly on the current legislation, which has instead been kept almost unchanged and thus leading to regulatory confusion during the adjustment process . On the other hand, eliminating the rigidity of the current legislation and encouraging more evolving legislation adapted to the territory is certainly a long-desired goal. However, this progress will have to be accompanied by a parallel respect for the balance between the Union's institutions, so that delegated acts do not become a tool for circumventing general rules, or the role of Parliament. For this reason, the multiannual plans remain the most suitable instrument to promote an efficient development of the regionalization process we are discussing.

The EU is a contracting party to the Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization, SPRFMO, and therefore the binding management and conservation measures adopted by that organization must be incorporated into EU law. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation. The South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organization covers a quarter of the earth's international waters. It does not manage the tuna area. These species are instead covered by other international conventions. The most important species covered are horse mackerel and squid. The organization entered into force on 24 August 2012 and is one of the newest regional fisheries organizations in the world. There are currently 15 Contracting Parties and two cooperating non-Contracting Parties to the Organization: Liberia and Panama. Belize was a contracting party for a few years but withdrew in May 2016. This is the first time that the EU will transpose these rules into EU law. The Commission's proposal aims to incorporate the various conservation and management measures adopted so far, closer to 15. It covers a wide range of issues, from IUU fishing to measures to reduce mortality among seabirds and exploratory fishing. The EU's main activity is regional pelagic trawling for horse mackerel, which has been caught since 1979. After a period without fishing activities, it resumed in 2005 with small catches of less than 10% of the total stock. Vessels from four Member States participate in this fishery, even though they are all linked to a single company. This bill does not specify how much you can fish, but it may be of interest that the fishing catch follows the scientific advice. The Scientific Committee for, among other things, the fishing mortality for horse mackerel was below the FMSY level, while the biomass was below the level that can give MSY, BMSY. The Scientific Committee therefore recommended that the catches be kept for 2017 and 2018 below 493,000 tonnes, where the EU's share amounts to 30,115 tonnes. Overall, the Commission's proposal aims at the full transposition of the conservation and management measures adopted by SPRFMO. Some of these provisions are already included in the Common Fisheries Policy, including the vessel monitoring mechanism, DMS, and certain control provisions. There is therefore no reason to repeat them in the proposal. One important thing is missing in the Commission's proposal of the measures adopted by SPRFMO: CMM 08-2013 introduces a total ban on the use of both large pelagic driftnets and all deep-sea nets or so-called deep-sea nets. The Commission has probably not transposed this measure because there are currently no Union vessels using this type of fishing gear. The ban on deep-sea nets or deep-sea nets is not reflected in other parts of the common fisheries policy. It is an international obligation and therefore the prohibition should be included in this Regulation together with associated definitions of gear. Finally, SPRFMO has adopted many necessary fishing restrictions for both trawls and longlines to prevent the capture of seabirds. This is commendable because the EU action plan for seabirds wants to draw attention to the high mortality among seabirds in connection with fishing around the world. The Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources is said to have reduced longline reef-related seabird mortality by more than 90% through relatively simple and efficient technical adaptations of gear and fishing methods. Equally effective measures to prevent seabird deaths must be taken within SPRFMO's Commission area, as well as in other sea areas. The EU, which works according to best practice, must, of course, make the same demands in this regulation.

The Commission proposal transposes into EU law the conservation control and enforcement measures adopted by the South Pacific Regional Fisheries Management Organisation, to which the European Union is a contracting party. This is a challenging file because of the high number of conservation measures adopted under the SPRFMO since 2012. The Commission welcomes most amendments proposed by the European Parliament’s Committee on Fisheries (PECH), as they clarify some of the obligations in its initial proposal. However, the Commission is not in a position to support the amendments relating to (a) the provisions to promote artisanal small-scale fisheries, and (b) the definition of ‘fishing vessel’ and ‘IUU fishing’, for the following reasons. Firstly, the provisions on artisanal and small-scale fisheries (I’m referring to Amendments 1 and 12) are inspired by the recent transposition of the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas (ICCAT) recommendations. However, the fisheries’ characteristics and geographical context is not the same in the SPRFMO, where the EU fleet fishing is composed of industrial long-distance factory vessels, including some of the most modern and largest fishing ships in the world. In addition to that, the SPRFMO convention area does not include the EEZs, which are the areas where traditional and artisanal fisheries operate. The European Union fleet fishes solely in the high seas and does not have access to the adjacent EEZs and even less to the territorial waters. Therefore the EU fleet fishing in SPRFMO is unable to promote coastal fishing activities and techniques. Secondly, the PECH Committee proposes, in its Amendment 5, the use of the definition of ‘fishing vessel’ from the SPRFMO. The Commission considers that we should avoid a multiplication of definitions of ‘fishing vessel’ used in different EU legal texts with already-existing definition in the Control Regulation and in the EU IUU Regulation. The preference should be then to keep the definition used under the European Union IUU Regulation, which is the one used in the Commission proposal. Thirdly, as far as the definition of ‘illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing’ is concerned (and I am referring to Amendment 10), the European Parliament proposes to refer only to point 1 of Article 2 of the IUU Regulation. However, it is better to refer to the entire IUU Regulation in order not to lose the individual definitions of ‘illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing’ foreseen in its Article 2. The SPRFMO transposition regulation will also allow a faster and more efficient implementation of future SPRFMO conservation measures, thanks to the derogation of certain well-framed powers to the Commission. I strongly support this practical approach as it will allow the Union to deliver on its international obligation towards the regional fisheries management organisations in a timely manner, providing certainty to Member States and a level playing field for operators. Let me assure you that the Commission will continue working together with the regional fisheries management organisations to ensure better ocean governance and more sustainable fishing.

The first adds guarantees to comply with the total ban on the use of large-scale gillnets and pelagic drift nets. Although no European vessel uses these gears in the area under the control of this organization, I consider it very useful to oblige Member States to control their vessels when they pass through this area with this type of gear on board. The second encourages Member States to promote selective coastal fishing activities, including techniques used in traditional and artisanal fishing, to contribute to a decent standard of living for local coastal communities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 160, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner, I would logically like to congratulate the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs for this work and, having intervened in the previous debate, with healthy envy I say that this has been developed without major shocks and that there are no elements of controversy, of which I am glad.

In fact, only a few amendments were not acceptable from the Commission perspective. The SPRFMO transposition regulation will, as has already been said by most of the Members, allow a faster and more efficient implementation of new conservation measures in Union law, thanks to the delegation of certain well-framed powers to the Commission. This practical approach will allow the Union to deliver on its international obligations vis-à-vis RFMOs in a timely manner. There was one comment that I would like to comment on. Mr Mato mentioned the need to transpose in good time. However, we have to keep in mind that the SPRFMO is a very young RFMO, and its first annual meeting was held in 2013. After this meeting, the SPRFMO had envisaged a medium-term plan to adopt a comprehensive system of conservation and management measures by 2016. Therefore, it was decided to delay the transposition until the new measures were adopted in order to avoid having to repeat a lengthy and complex transposition exercise twice within a limited time.  The transposition is a complex and time-consuming process. It requires an article-by-article analysis of every SPRFMO conservation and management measure in order to incorporate it into EU law. In most cases, the original provision does not allow for a simple replication. That means we cannot simply copy and paste the text. It is therefore necessary to adapt the provisions to the EU language specificities and actors. My thanks again to the European Parliament for its opinion.

An implementation report such as the one we are discussing today is a tool at our disposal to make an analysis of where we have arrived and above all to understand all together what can be the best ways to grow and improve the tools that the Union makes available of its citizens. I believe that we have succeeded in this objective and that is why I ask the Commission and the Commissioner to continue working together, to give a positive follow-up to the work done so far. Coming to the report, we have had the opportunity to understand how, although relatively young, macro-regional strategies have become a consolidated tool and as such they must be treated, leaving the experimentation phase, using best practices to improve governance mechanisms and, above all, , to stabilize forms of financing aimed at strategies on both the European and national sides. This is why we ask for two fundamental things in the report. The first request is addressed to the Member States: we ask for specific commitments, especially in the early stages, at the very moment of the establishment of strategies in terms of financial and human resources. We also ask for the provision, also with the support of the Commission, of forms of incentives or facilitations for actions to implement the strategies. Secondly, we instead ask the Commission to use the forthcoming reforms of the financial framework and cohesion policy both to redefine and better calibrate the targets and objectives of the macro-regions, and to track within the future regulations, a new role, sectors of intervention, also in light of the new priorities that the Union is giving itself, and forms of implementation work, identify specific measures and projects to define certain sources of funding to achieve them. In general, it is necessary to progressively overcome the mechanism whereby the strategies must, from time to time, ask for funding from different programs, effectively reinforcing from the outset the direct link between the actions of the strategies themselves and the sources of EU funding. As for the \"three no\" rule (no to new structures, no to new rules and no to new funding), I believe the time has come to open a reflection, or to understand how and in what way, after ten years from the first strategies, it must be declined to continue to have a sense that we understand, and it does not become just a ballast. This is why we ask the Commission that in the next report it can also provide us with the analysis of the impact of the three no's on the implementation of strategies and on the realization of projects. Finally, governance, probably the most delicate point. We agree that the implementation of strategies can no longer be entrusted solely to national governments but must be shared and implemented with the consent and close cooperation of local, regional and above all civil society levels. In fact, too often - and I would like to conclude on this point - strategies sin by lack of ownership and suffer from this lack. The national level is too distant and probably too little attentive; for this reason it is essential to bring ownership of strategies closer to citizens, giving back to local autonomies and regions an active and decisive role in the planning and implementation phase. These seem to me to be the points on which we have reached a broad consensus in the report and I hope that the debate can confirm this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 167, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   membre de la Commission. – Madame la Présidente, bonne année. Madam President, let me start by thanking Mr Cozzolino for his report. The Commission welcomes all the efforts to provide an analysis for all the EU macro—regional strategies – the Danube, the Baltic, the Alpine and the Adriatic—Ionian. I believe your work complements the report published by the Commission one year ago, and indeed we share the same belief that the success of all four macro—regional strategies requires continuous commitment and, of course, the active participation of all the relevant actors and administrations. I sometimes have the impression that the steering wheel is still in the hands of the Commission, but when it comes to implementation, you know very well that the ball should be in the court of the participating countries. It is a question of political ownership. This means pooling together, as we said, all efforts and resources, be they human, administrative or financial, to translate the commitment into delivery of concrete projects on the ground. It is therefore crucial that participating countries and regions take political ownership of their respective strategies. Having said that, I think we can all agree that over the last few years the four macro—regional strategies have started to instil a true culture of territorial cooperation. That is what I felt every time I was involved, because I participated in all the annual forums of the macro—regional strategies. Last November I was in Munich at the Annual Forum of the EU Strategy for the Alpine Region. I witnessed the willingness of all actors present to make a true difference through their cooperation. So it gave me hope that macro-regions can improve the implementation of European Union policies and territorial cohesion. This means that we need to make sure that the objectives of each macro—regional strategy are embedded into national priorities. For example, for the Alpine Region, 80 cohesion programmes cover the Alpine territory. These programmes can support the objectives of the Alpine strategy, but they are often implemented in isolation. So I call upon you, Honourable Members of the European Parliament, to pass on the message in your respective countries and constituencies that all programmes should go in the same direction. As rightly underlined by Mr Cozzolino in his report, macro—regional strategies can only thrive if they are rooted in a long-term process. Thank you for your attention.

It is also very important that in this better coordination, better use of the budget, we pay special attention to sustainable development, to include the goals of sustainable development of the United Nations and that also important European policies such as circular economy, clean energy be included in this cohesion policy, ie macro-regional development strategies. after 2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 172, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Laurenţiu REBEGA", "mepid": "124792", "text": "on behalf of the ENF Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, almost 10 years after these macro-regional strategies were put into practice, there are still difficulties in implementation due to the different involvement of states, in terms of funding, resources and political support. For Romania, which is the initiator of the Strategy for the Danube region, it is very important to consolidate this approach together with the other states involved. At the level of Romania, an attempt was made to develop mechanisms that would favor the projects relevant for the Danube Strategy, either by carrying out separate project requests, or by awarding additional points in the final evaluation of the projects. Commissioner, it is essential that we continue to support these strategies and ensure the necessary funding after 2020.

I would like to dwell on the Strategy for the Danube Region, where the rapporteur makes concrete proposals, which I also support - the reopening of a strategy center for the Danube Region, which could contribute to a better implementation of the strategy. Sure, I could say that I agree with the three, but I would be happy to have a macro strategy for the Black Sea region, as we have for the Baltic Sea and the Adriatic Sea. In any case, I hope to continue after 2020, not to confuse.

We are all going in the same direction, and we are all willing to show our commitment to strengthening these macro-regional strategies and their roles and capacities. The next multiannual financial framework will be submitted by the Commission in May and will provide us with a window of opportunity to introduce macro-regional strategies in the EU policy landscape. Macro-regional strategies are, as we said here, without any doubt one of the flagships of territorial cooperation. As you said, it is one of the most tangible expressions of the EU added value. Many of you, including Mr Picula, Ms Bresso, Mr Bogovič and Mr Jakovčić, underlined the political importance of these macro-regional strategies. This is the only framework that we have now in European policies to put EU Member States and non-member states on an equal footing with equal rights, sharing experiences and best practices. It is very important for the hopes for enlargement and for the hopes of those countries. But as Mr Cozzolino underlined in his report, as well as during this discussion, macro-regional strategies provide the relevant framework for improving the results of EU policies and first and foremost, as you said, of cohesion policy. Now more than ever, we need to show that we can establish concrete cooperation to help us to be stronger in addressing the serious challenges that we are all facing. The Commission will consider very carefully its proposal on how to guarantee better coherence between the macro-regional objectives and those that will be supported through our programmes. We are ready to seek better links with cohesion policy, and we are aiming for the coherence of the whole policy framework.  I would like to conclude by assuring you once again that we will remain a fervent supporter of macro-regional strategies. I admit that we have not been successful at all times, and we have to call upon the Member States to do their part. The European Commission is a facilitator, but when it comes to selecting a project, the only strategy that has introduced this transnational cooperation concept is the Baltic one, and it is an example for other macro-regional strategies. To be honest, as I said I am a great supporter of this. Sometimes I don’t understand why for so many years the Minister of Foreign Affairs fought for these macro-regional strategies, and then when they are adopted and in place, there are no projects. They don’t come up with common projects. It is therefore really important to bring together the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of European Funds and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the same countries and have this cross-border cooperation project. Nonetheless, we continue to encourage all the stakeholders to participate. We will continue to disseminate good practices so that each of the four macro-regional strategies learns from the three others. We will also continue to communicate on the benefits of these strategies in order to raise citizens’ awareness. You raised this Mediterranean and Black Sea issue. As I said, these macro-regional strategies are voted on by the Council at the request of the Member States. If they are adopted by the Council, the Commission would be ready to be a facilitator.  I would like once again to express my gratitude to you, to the European Parliament and, in particular, to Mr Cozzolino and all the people who worked on this very important document, to the REGI Committee in particular for your support of the macro-regional concept as a valuable tool to improve our collective action. I am also very glad – I see that Mr Novakov is no longer here – that the Bulgarian Presidency has designated cohesion policy a priority for the next six months. I therefore rely on you to fight together to preserve this policy, which the most tangible policy that improves the lives of citizens and has visible results in our European Union to fulfil the discrepancies and gaps that we still have. Thank you once again.

This was a very strong reaction after the Greece crisis, and at that time we believed, together with the Commission, that we could support Greece in the efforts of the country to get out of the crisis and succeed in the efforts to complete and implement the successful projects. The goal of this proposal was two-fold: to provide additional pre-financing for 2014-2020 cohesion policy operational programmes under the investment for growth and jobs goal and for programmes financed from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund in Greece, and secondly, to allow for the ceiling for the cumulative pre-financing and interim payments to be 100% and to increase the co-financing rate for 2007-2013 operational programmes for the convergence and regional competitiveness and employment objectives in Greece to 100%. In the European Parliament, the decision was taken to deal with this revision on CPR under the simplified procedure (it was the decision of the REGI Committee), so we adopted this proposal as quickly as possible in order to allow a greater stimulus effect to make sure that the Greek authorities could make full use of European Union funding available for the cohesion policy under the previous financial period. The REGI Committee appointed a standing rapporteur to follow the implementation of the new regulation – later on he will take the floor here in the debate. But on several occasions, including during a joint hearing organised by the Committee on Regional Development and the Committee on Budgetary Control on the implementation of the priority projects list initiative in Greece on 4 December 2017, Members of Parliament expressed their regret at the near absence of communication between the Commission and Parliament on the implementation and performance of these CPR amendments. The lack of reporting information made available by the Commission and the Greek authorities on the result of the special measures adopted for Greece should be emphasised. More specifically, there has been no reporting on the real effects on the application of the maximum cofinancing rate of 100% to the eligible expenditure of Greek operational programmes for the growth and regional competitiveness in employment objectives. In this respect, the first part of our question will be: what conclusions does the Commission draw from the report provided by the Greek authorities in May 2017 on the implementation of the specific measures in Greece? And further on, how this mechanism, which is an extraordinary mechanism, has helped further progress in the priority projects in Greece in their implementation and progress of these 181 priority projects. And on how infrastructure investments and European Union structural investment funds have contributed to the improvement of overall competitiveness of Greece. It is very important to implement today these discussions to hear the answer of the Commission, because we made these together to support Greece in the country’s efforts, and now we are very interested to see how our measures have been implemented in reality in Greece and what the results are after these extraordinary measures.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 195, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I apologise to the honourable Members at the beginning, but there were so many questions and I will take a bit longer, because I do not like to be criticised as we are always very open. First I would like to thank Parliament for giving me this opportunity to talk about these specific measures for Greece which we adopted together, as we said, in October 2015. I am very grateful to the Committee on Regional Development and in particular to the Chair, Mrs Mihaylova, and to Mr Arimont for their continuous support in promoting these measures. I would also like to thank the Committee on Budgetary Control (CONT) – they are not here – for their constant interest, in particular in implementing the priority project list, as we said, which was launched in 2011 by my predecessor, Commissioner Hahn. As you know, we have together adopted extraordinary measures for extraordinary times, as you said, Madam President. The impact of these specific measures in favour of Greece shows to what extent cohesion policy has played a decisive role in relaunching the Greek economy. They are also a vivid expression of the solidarity of cohesion policy, and I hereby confirm that the Commission stands by the Greek authorities to assist them in boosting jobs and growth. I think it is important to recall, first of all, the extraordinary nature of these specific measures. As you well know, in 2015 the Commission proposed to amend the Common Provision Regulation because Greece was desperately in need of liquidity. The purpose of this revision was to frontload existing EU funds for investment in growth-enhancing projects with two objectives in mind: to help implement the 2007-2013 programmes and to kick-start investments under the new programming period. In total, approximately EUR 2 billion were paid to Greece in 2015 and 2016. This included EUR 1 billion for the 2007-2013 period, linked to two measures: first, the increase of the EU cofinancing rate to 100%, which meant that no national contribution was needed; second, the early release of the last 5% of remaining EU payments, normally released only at the closure of the programmes. To maximise the impact of these additional amounts, Greece undertook the commitment to channel them via a ring—fenced account. The other EUR 1 billion was made available by increasing the rate of initial pre-financing for 2014—2020 programmes. Measuring the impact of the specific measures on the completion of individual projects is not an easy task, as cohesion policy assistance is provided at programme level. But what is certain is that without these measures there would have been many more uncompleted projects and Greece would have had serious trouble financing their completion. The report provided by the Greek authorities indeed shows that, thanks to these specific measures, the number of uncompleted projects was drastically reduced for 2007-2013, and only 79 projects are yet to be completed out of more than 50 000. One of the most striking examples is the completion of the five highway concessions. The liquidity provided for the specific measures was a prime contributor to their finalisation. Regarding the priority project list, I believe that the outcome of the exercise has been satisfactory. It includes over 180 projects in a wide range of sectors. To date, close to 120 projects have been completed, while 18 projects are being completed with national funds. 24 projects are being continued in the current period. The whole mechanism has worked as a trigger for the Greek Government and local and regional authorities to take ownership and action when projects were not moving ahead as they should. Overall these specific measures have brought Greece back on track for the benefit of the Greek citizens. The high amount of liquidity injected in a short period of time relaunched investments in the Greek real economy. According to the 2017-2018 edition of the Global Competitiveness Index, Greece scores particularly well on infrastructure and ranks 38th out of 137. As regards the increased competitiveness of Greece, when we compare the 2017-2018 edition of the Global Competitiveness Index with the 2012—2013 one, Greece has improved notably in own infrastructures, technological readiness and innovation. These are typically sectors for which structural funds have provided extensive support in the past decades. These measures were extraordinary. I think they are the epitome of what cohesion policy should be: solidarity in action and not only in words. It is a policy that delivers, adapts to circumstances, helps concretely and has a tangible impact on the daily lives of millions of Europeans. I would like to conclude by underlining that the Commission will continue to provide all the information to Parliament.

I don't speak this language and then expected to be conveyed to me in a language that I understand and can also evaluate. I have actually waited until today and I am glad that we are making this interpellation today, because today - oh wonder - I received this text in German. I regret this, firstly because the citizens of Europe have the right to know whether this money has been spent correctly and secondly because I would also like to use this report to prove and prove that cohesion policy is important, that it represents European added value and should also exist beyond 2020.

The crisis has caused serious liquidity problems in the public and padlocks in the private sector. The previous government of Antonis Samaras claimed, managed with the help of the European Union, forward funding. He had designed and prepared a list of 175 projects, worth five billion euros. The current government is kneeling citizens and businesses by over-taxing. Anyone who celebrates that Greece is the first to be absorbed by the current NSRF is foolish. The reality is reflected on the European Commission's website. Greece started with the largest advance of 8%, twice as much as other countries, but is in fifth place for absorption.

Știți foarte bine că eu cred că rolul nostru în Uniunea Europeană este de a ne arăta solidaritatea, mai ales în momente dificile.  Cele mai multe vizite le-am făcut în Italia după ce această țară a fost atât de greu încercată de cutremur, apoi în țările care au fost încercate de incendii și, bineînțeles, în Grecia, unde am fost în acea primă fază, când, într-adevăr, așa cum am spus, guvernul era într-o disperare totală, după care, încet, încet, am încercat să ajutăm și am venit în fața dumneavoastră, împreună cu aceste măsuri extraordinare pentru o situație extraordinară. Vreau să vă spun celor care ne reproșați că nu vă dăm suficiente informații că nu este ușor. Este vorba de 50 000 de proiecte, noi nu putem să dăm informații, nu avem cum. Noi lucrăm la nivel de programe, să dăm informații despre fiecare proiect individual nu este ușor, dar, pe de altă parte, încercăm, bineînțeles, la nivel de program să vă dăm toate informațiile posibile. Eu vă spun, ceea ce am spus și la început, că, fără aceste măsuri extraordinare, cred că Grecia ar fi avut serioase probleme în a depăși criza în care se afla. I would like to say that, in my view, this is a misunderstanding. The Committee on Regional Development received monthly reports about the implementation of cohesion policy programmes for 2007-2013 and for 2014-2020. It seems to me that there is a misunderstanding about the closure of the procedure. Greece submitted the closure documents by 31 March 2017. The Commission services sent their comments in August 2017, and the Greek authorities answered in those comments with the revised closure document in December 2017. So the final assessment is expected to be concluded in the first half of 2018. This is in accordance with the procedure set out in the Common Provisions Regulation that applies to all Member States. The Commission will provide all information, as foreseen in the regulation. As regards information on what Greece did with this EUR two billion, it is up to the government, not us, to provide that. We have received this and are now translating it – with a slight delay, and we apologise for that – but you will receive this report. Following all your interventions I would like to be very clear that the specific measures for Greece have had a far-reaching impact that goes, in my view, beyond the liquidity issues. As a result of these measures, Greece has been the first Member State to reach full absorption of available funds under 2007-2013. Greece is also among the best-performing Member States regarding the implementation of 2014-2020 programmes. These promising results echo all the efforts we, the Commission and European Parliament, have made together, to support Greece and encourage it in tackling its challenges. I say to Mr Marias that we have created so many jobs, and it is not fair to say that only the multinationals are creating jobs for the younger generation in Greece. I do not share this view. We have invested so much in research and innovation in Greece. It is very important to share this news and go beyond this way of thinking, because it is really important to know exactly what we are doing. We can provide you with details of exactly what we have done for the younger generation of Greek people. We have also provided support in rural areas and also in the most deprived areas. You know very well that we are providing as much help as we can to all the islands, which have been much hit migratory problems. Assistance to the tune of EUR 20 billion for 2014-2020 from the structural funds is helping Greece regenerate its economy and boost its competitiveness by promoting a new model based on innovation and entrepreneurship. You can see very well, as I said at the beginning, in all the indicators and statistics. I am very confident that in the current period Greece will make ever greater achievements, thanks especially to the concentration of resources and efforts in selected productive sectors, in line with the national and regional smart specialisation strategies, as well as the necessary structural reforms for the modernisation of the public sector. With the ongoing support from the European Parliament, I hope that you will continue to help Greece thrive. Things are not as good as we had hoped, but we hope that together we will help the Member States most in need. Greece was in this situation, and I am very proud that we have achieved all these things for the Greek people in the last three years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 214, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 215, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The agenda calls for the debate on the report by José Inácio Faria on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, on international ocean governance: a program for the future of ouroceans in the context of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (2017/2055 (INI) (A8-0399 / 2017)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 216, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "José Inácio FARIA", "mepid": "125101", "text": "reporter. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the seas and oceans represent 70% of the planet's surface and its water accounts for 97% of the world's total water. The seas provide food, energy, mobility, medicines and leisure, and are a source of economic growth. Oceans, along with coastal and marine resources, play an essential role in human well-being and economic and social development worldwide. According to OECD estimates, ocean-based industries represent a gross world-wide added value of around 1.3 billion euros, which could double by 2030. The oceans are also home to rich, fragile and, to a large extent, biodiversity. , untapped, which offers a variety of important ecosystem resources and services. Marine and coastal economies are developing worldwide, but their success depends on better sustainability. The oceans also play a key role in regulating the climate system, supplying half of our oxygen, absorbing about 25% of the CO2 emissions produced and redistributing heat across the planet. The oceans are, in fact, our greatest allies against climate change and have been included in the Paris Agreement. However, our oceans are extremely vulnerable to overexploitation, climate change, such as global warming of the oceans, environmental degradation, water acidification due to emissions resulting from human activities, pollution and a decrease in biodiversity. Some of these more urgent global challenges, including climate change, poverty, safe and sufficient food for a population projected to reach 9 billion by 2050, can only be addressed effectively if the oceans are safe, clean and managed sustainably. To address all of these challenges, better international governance is needed in order to strengthen efforts at regional and global level. These challenges were recognized globally at both the Rio + 20 summit and the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which identified the conservation and sustainable use of our oceans as one of the 17 sustainable development goals and as part of an agenda highly interconnected. The joint Communication of the European Commission and the High Representative in 2016 on the international governance of the oceans, which is an integral part of the European Union's response to the 2030 Agenda, was based on a broad consensus on the need to strengthen the governance framework of oceans, reduce the pressure on them, exploit them in a sustainable way and that, to that end, greater knowledge of the oceans would be necessary, proposing for this purpose 50 actions to ensure safe, clean and sustainably managed oceans in Europe and the world. world. The international governance of the oceans is concerned with three areas of action for the European Union: sustainable development, growth and employment and Union intervention in the world. For Europe, the maritime economy and international competitiveness are, in this context, of particular importance given the increasingly worrying state of the oceans and the impact that human activities have on them. In either case, the success of management is a challenge to be overcome worldwide. The Union and the Member States must act more firmly and together. This report, which will be voted on tomorrow, encourages the Commission to develop partnerships in the field of the oceans with the main players in this field, as a means to achieve better international governance of the oceans. The way we deal with the oceans is crucial for our survival as a species and, in Malta, Commissioner Vella mentioned, during the “Our Ocean” Conference, that the oceans are the blue heart of the Earth and that it is up to us all us the task of keeping that heart beating. It fits- we now have the urgent task of acting in defense of the oceans and creating a new and ambitious international governance of the oceans.And for all this, ladies and gentlemen, I hope to be able to count on your favorable vote tomorrow during the vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 217, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Sirpa PIETIKÄINEN", "mepid": "40599", "text": "   – Madam President, first of all I would like to thank my colleague, Mr Faria, for his excellent report.

If we cannot do it no other part of the world will, and it does require from our side a very clear leadership role. We know huge progress has been made in recycling in recent years but much of that progress has been made on the development of markets in other parts of the world.

If we cannot lead on this issue, as I said, no one else will follow us. That is why it is so important when it comes to our seas, be it in the area of industrial fishing, plastics, the whole question of pollution, that the European Union has to lead on this issue. This report challenges those of us within the 28 Member States to do much more in terms of leadership.

I very much welcome the European Parliament’s own-initiative report on international ocean governance, as well as your support for the general objectives of the Joint Communication and its actions. I would like to thank all the speakers for your valuable comments as well. This Joint Communication is a major step forward, as this is the first time that the Commission and the High Representative have issued such a policy statement on the oceans. With this Communication, the European Union is taking the lead as a global actor in strengthening international ocean governance.  The success of the ‘Our Ocean Conference’, which was hosted by the European Union three months ago in Malta, confirms our engagement to be at the frontline to tackle global ocean challenges.  The Joint Communication on international ocean governance is an integral part of the EU response to the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 14. It sets out 50 concrete and tangible actions in three priority areas for safe, secure, clean and sustainably managed oceans.  Our first priority is to improve the international ocean governance framework. A globalised world needs a more cooperative global governance. We believe in the power of diplomacy, rules and international institutions, but there is no real global governance without a cooperative oceans governance. As a matter of fact, the European Union is deploying the necessary efforts through our cooperation on multilateral, regional and bilateral level, as well as concrete projects and programmes. In the same direction, promoting maritime multilateralism is a strategic priority for the EU. In line with the EU global strategy, secured and protected seas and oceans can only be achieved through collaborative efforts. In this regard, I very much welcome last month’s decision by the UN General Assembly on a resolution to convene an Intergovernmental Conference to elaborate the text of an internationally legally binding instrument under United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), on marine biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction, which the European Union has championed for many years.  Our second priority is to further engage in international action to reduce the pressures and their causes on the oceans. Pressures and causes such as marine litter, the consequences of climate change, such as a rise in sea level, warming and acidification, as well as ensuring the sustainable use of the oceans and their biodiversity, merge into this priority. This also depends on the appropriate planning and management of human uses. Promoting maritime spatial planning and our marine environmental legislation at regional and global level is key in this regard, and I am very pleased to see your support on this issue. In addition, the upcoming plastic strategy will further complement our fight against marine litter. Oceans are also very important for many developing countries as a potential source of food, of jobs and revenue. We are working with several countries on programmes that support sustainable fisheries, marine protected areas and coastal zone management, climate mitigation in the maritime shipping sector, harbour infrastructure and even maritime security. Ongoing programmes amount to some EUR 590 million, and more are in preparation under the 2014-2020 programing.  Finally, we are working to further advance our knowledge of the oceans. We shall therefore keep investing over EUR 260 million per year in marine and maritime research projects. Modern technologies are opening up new possibilities and we should make the most of them. Another aim is to step up ocean observations and to create a worldwide marine data network which is open to all. We will further develop marine research and science partnerships with key international partners. These actions, whether they are stricto sensu related to the ocean governance framework, or to pressures on the marine environment, marine security and research, are all part of a holistic approach. There is a logic to this approach. The pressures that the oceans are facing are not only global, but also interconnected, as are the solutions. Yet the success of EU action depends not only on us, but also on our international partners. In this respect, your support on establishing ocean partnerships with key ocean players is highly appreciated. This will provide the opportunity to bring issues of common concern and interest on ocean governance to the table.

In addition to the many problems caused by global warming, one of the fastest growing threats to the health of the world’s oceans is the accumulation and spread of marine litter. Microplastics are of particular concern because, due to their insignificant size, they are available to a wide range of organisms (seabirds, fish, mussels, sandflies, and zooplankton). The staggering figure of 150 million tonnes of plastic that has accumulated in the world’s oceans is causing serious environmental and economic damage, including coastal communities, tourism, maritime transport and fishing. In this context, we need an ambitious circular economy package with targets for reducing marine litter in the European Union from 30% by 2025 and 50% by 2030, and larger targets for plastic packaging recycling.

I am very proud to stand here today and present the first report in the European Parliament on climate justice. A big thank you to all the shadow rapporteurs for an excellent collaboration. In this report, the European Parliament recognizes the fact that the effects of climate change are unevenly distributed and not gender neutral. They affect women, children and indigenous peoples disproportionately much more. The UN estimates that 70 percent of the 1.3 billion people living in poverty worldwide are women, often living in the countries most at risk of floods, rising sea levels, droughts and storms. Women and children are also 14 times more likely than men to die in natural disasters. Climate justice aims to protect the most vulnerable and ensures a fair distribution of burdens and benefits of climate change and its effects. Women are just as important actors as men and can play a crucial role in developing our climate policy. Therefore, women must be represented equally in the decision-making process and the implementation of climate policy. The report also contains an important reference to the fact that climate change is a driving force for migration. The developments we are seeing in parts of Africa and the Middle East are likely to contribute to political instability, economic strains and an escalation of refugee flows and migration. Around the year 2050, the UN estimates that the world may have up to 200 million people displaced from their homes due to climate change. This is a future perspective that we cannot continue to ignore. We need to develop the UN system of migration and existing definitions and tools, so that they include this category of refugees. At the most recent climate summit in Bonn, the first gender equality plan was adopted under the Paris Agreement. All Member States should now choose a contact point for work on gender equality and the climate - a major step forward for an issue that has been so downgraded and opposed. In the UN system, work is underway to include climate refugees in the global migration strategy, and in that work we call on the EU to be proactive. The EU's refugee policy is a failure and a fatal failure in terms of legal security and accountability. With the forecast of an even more unjust world, lack of resources and rising global temperatures driving people to flee, politicians across the political spectrum understand that something must be done. People who have lost everything through floods and droughts today have no rights and are increasingly becoming climate refugees. Climate refugees are about rising temperatures and water levels, but when we talk about climate justice, we are often talking about people in other parts of the world, in the countries hardest hit by these consequences. But even in my country, Sweden, in the north, the consequences of climate change are noticeable in a dramatic way. The reindeer herding Sami in Norrland live in the front line of climate change. 300 reindeer went through the ice when they were to be herded to new pastures last year. It should not really be able to happen, but the winters are getting warmer and the old paths where the Sami have herded their animals for generations and where the ice has functioned as a route no longer hold. This creates huge problems for people and animals in the north. Entire ecosystems are now changing rapidly before our eyes and that is why it is so important to raise the issue of justice. Most vulnerable are those who are discriminated against and marginalized in our societies, not to mention how animals are affected. In two years, an ecosystem as large as the whole of Italy has disappeared on the seabed. These are unique coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Australia. I do not think there is a clearer example of the rampant climate crisis. The answer to all these challenges is about stopping and adapting to climate change and protecting the most vulnerable through an inclusive and feminist climate agenda.With this report, we will have adopted a common definition of what climate justice actually is and a range of tools that can channel resources to those who need it most.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 228, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "- This report states that climate change, in particular weather fluctuations, droughts, floods, is having a greater negative impact on the lives of those who are in some way at risk of poverty, illiteracy or their dignity.

Of course, this is something we should do, but I'm afraid it's just about calming our own conscience. There is, therefore, an awareness that a large number of migrant women are subjected to various forms of violence and this, as we see, is taken for granted, as if there is no alternative to illegal migration and the organized crime that benefits from it. No one is asking how much of our guilt is that these women die at the hands of smugglers, and many of them in Europe end up in a chain of prostitution.

Let me start by emphasising that gender equality matters in its own right, and that it matters for effective climate action and sustainable development. This is rightly recognised in the report. Women are disproportionately vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, where their rights and socioeconomic status are not equal to those of men, and where they have less voice and influence than men in shaping policies and prioritising how climate finance is used. The empowerment of women is an important ingredient in building climate resilience and, as pointed out in the resolution, women are primary agents of change and effective risk managers. The European Union is already committed to promoting a gender perspective in climate policies, both domestically and internationally, and to supporting women’s engagement and gender equality in the international negotiations under the United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The European Union’s stance in climate negotiations has been, and continues to be, that the full and equal participation of women in climate negotiations and in the design of climate action is key. The EU delegation in climate talks also comprises over 50% women, and two out of three leading EU negotiators are women. Moreover, the Commission has been directly involved in shaping the development of a gender action plan under the UNFCCC. We have not only been participating and contributing to a round of informal consultations on the development of the gender action plan, but also are one of the few organisations providing dedicated funding to the UNFCCC secretariat’s work on gender activities. This support is critical for the continuation of the work that the UNFCCC is doing on gender. At COP 23 in Bonn, the European Union played an active and enabling role in the negotiations leading up to the adoption of this gender action plan. By supporting the implementation of gender—related decisions and mandates under the Convention, this gender action plan seeks to advance women’s full, equal and meaningful participation and promote gender—responsive climate policy and the mainstreaming of a gender perspective in the work of parties. It sets out five priority areas: first, capacity-building, knowledge sharing and communication. Second, gender—balanced participation and women’s leadership. Third, coherence; fourth, gender—responsive implementation and means of implementation. And fifth, monitoring and reporting, all supported by a list of proposed activities such as workshops for policymakers on gender—responsive policies and holding a dialogue with the standing committee on finance on its work to improve gender—sensitive access to climate finance. The empowerment of women and upscaling climate action are also central in our development cooperation efforts. We implement targeted measures to tackle gender inequalities and climate change issues in our partner countries, while also mainstreaming gender equality and climate change perspectives into all aspects of our development policy. Gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls are recognised as a cross-cutting driver for sustainable development in the new European consensus on development and the EU gender action plan 2016—2020. We can already see concrete results of this approach. The EU’s Global Climate Change Alliance Plus flagship initiative supports climate action in different areas, including by empowering women and addressing gender issues in the context of climate change and climate-induced migration. Half of the initiative’s partner countries recognise women as a particularly vulnerable group in their nationally determined contributions. The Global Climate Change Alliance Plus is embarking on further gender mainstreaming in its programmes and taking a leadership role for other EU climate funding instruments. Other positive examples include the Evergreening Africa with Trees project, the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade action plan and the SWITCH to Green initiative. At the same time, we are ready to further increase our efforts on the ground to promote the equal rights of women in our partner countries to participate in, and directly influence, decision—making processes on climate and environmental issues as well as resilience building. Closely linked to these is the key role women have in sustainable energy. They are actors of change, but are regrettably at the centre of the negative impacts of non-sustainable energy consumption. The EU’s new action, Women and Sustainable Energy, worth EUR 20 million, will foster women’s active role in sustainable energy, specifically through actions promoting women’s entrepreneurship, training and economic empowerment in the sustainable energy sector in developing countries. Finally, as most of you have noted, the report also refers to the increased migration that may occur as a result of climate change. The EU has politically supported the establishment by COP 21 of the task force on displacement. At this stage, the task force will map existing relevant policies and institutional frameworks that deal with migration. After mid—2018, it will move to the phase of developing recommendations for approaches to avert, minimise and address displacement related to climate change impacts. The Commission is aware of the importance of also mainstreaming gender in its internal climate policies. This summer, the Commission will publish an evaluation highlighting the results of its work on adaptation since 2013, setting the basis for further development of the EU adaptation strategy. Due consideration of vulnerable groups, including women, will be part of these discussions. We welcome the suggestion made in the resolution to support the development of indicators and collect gender—disaggregated data when planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating climate change policies, programmes and projects. We will also reflect on how to address this issue further in a concerted effort with all relevant Commission services. Last but not least, let me once again welcome this report by the European Parliament and congratulate the rapporteur, Ms Engström, on her work on this important topic of climate change and gender equality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 234, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Tuesday 16 January 2018.

Of these, women are the most vulnerable population precisely because of the lack of measures to consolidate gender equality. For this reason, climate justice requires measures to be taken to achieve social, employment and wage equality for men and women. It is well known that gender equality remains the greatest challenge of our time. The gender gap has narrowed significantly in recent years, but progress varies between Member States, and inequalities persist in many areas. An extremely large number of women continue to be discriminated against, without equal opportunities in education and the labor market. Particularly in the developing world, where women are particularly affected by climate change, although the vast majority work in agricultural work, very few of them own agricultural land. In addition, access to water in the same countries is particularly difficult and those most affected in this case are also women who, among other things, are in charge of household chores and food preparation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 237, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The agenda calls for one-minute interventions on important political issues (Rule 163 of the Rules of Procedure).", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 238, "date": "2018-01-15.json", "name": "Ivan ŠTEFANEC", "mepid": "124929", "text": "- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen.

The annual change of time is an anachronism in the age of the digital economy, much like a steam engine. The argument that daylight saving time saves electricity also fails, because in Indiana, for example, when daylight saving time was introduced, there was a 1% increase in electricity instead of savings. The shift in time also has a negative effect on human health. According to research from Sweden, the number of heart attacks in the week after the switch to summer time will increase by 5% and the number of traffic accidents even by 7%. Another team of scientists found that the number of accidents at work will increase by 5.7% during this period. People are simply disoriented, they don't sleep, which is reflected in their attention.

Therefore, across Europe, privatisation of key public services has to be reconsidered. For now, we must prioritise securing the jobs and pensions of the Carillion workers affected in my constituency and elsewhere.

Therefore, Croatia withdrew from the Agreement, respecting the legal procedure based on the Vienna Convention.

The principle of the state of first landing, signed for my country in 2003 by the Berlusconi government, must be reviewed as soon as possible. This Parliament has worked tirelessly to modify that treaty, not without facing obstacles represented by preconceptions, national selfishness, ideological positions or simply sterile opposition to any change. The risk now is that, with the Bulgarian Presidency first and then with the Austrian one, a sacrosanct reform will not come to light before the end of 2018.

The definition of hate speech can be debated, but if the prime minister of a country allows such words and this is not considered unacceptable by any parliamentary party leader, nor by the head of the Romanian head of state or any state authority, it is certainly suitable for intimidation and discrimination against the minority. social acceptance of expressions of temper.

I have no doubt that OLAF's investigations are independent and professional. That is why, in the case of politicians, the speed of investigation and transparency is in the public interest. In this particular case, there was no reason to keep the final report secret, which the media eventually obtained and published anyway. The OLAF report shows that fraud has taken place.
