Indeed this is not the first time I had the opportunity to discuss with you this very important topic. I would like to use the opportunity to reiterate the points which I have made previously. Combating all forms of violence against women and young girls is a core element of the respect for fundamental rights. These crimes have no place in the Union, and the Council is clear on zero tolerance of violence against women.   The Istanbul Convention is a comprehensive framework on violence against women and domestic violence. It constitutes a concrete tool to eradicate all forms of violence against women, protect its victims and prosecute the perpetrators. Finally, it contributes to the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women and promotes equality between women and men. All 28 Member States have already signed this Convention, and 18 of them have already ratified it. The Council has, on several occasions, encouraged those Member States who have not done so yet to ratify the Istanbul Convention. On 11 May 2017, the Council adopted the decisions on the signing of the Convention on behalf of the European Union. Our Presidency is carrying on the work on the conclusion of this important instrument. This includes reaching agreement on internal rules in the form of a code of conduct for the implementation of the Convention. According to the EU-wide survey on violence against women conducted by the Fundamental Rights Agency in 2014, one—in—three women, which means 33%, has experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15. One—in—five women, which means 18%, has experienced stalking; every second woman has been confronted with one or more forms of sexual harassment. Violence against women cannot be seen as a marginal issue that touches only on some women’s lives. Last but not least, gender-based violence also has a significant impact on economies and societies as a whole, for example in terms of health, legal and social services. In 2014, the European Institute for Gender Equality has estimated that the cost of violence against women in the European Union could amount to billions, or to be more precise, EUR 109 billion per year.  As President Tajani strongly affirmed, ‘the struggle for the elimination of violence against women is a fight that each and every one of us must take part in. It is our duty to stand up for women by drawing awareness to this injustice.’ The Council has repeatedly expressed its commitment to preventing and eliminating all forms of gender-based violence. We all know that only our joint efforts and a message of unity will help to improve the situation of all women and girls in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, one year ago, the European Union signed the Istanbul Convention, and since then we have seen women’s marches and the ‘#Me Too’ campaign confirm once again that violence against women is a global issue that continues to affect women and girls in every part of the world. We know that this violence is part of an effort to keep women in their place as lesser citizens and this is unacceptable. The Convention is the first legally binding international instrument with enforceable provisions to prevent and combat violence against women. The Commission’s intention is to conclude EU accession as soon as possible. Since the signature, we have been working intensively with the Member States and the Council to reach an agreement on a Code of Conduct that sets out the practical arrangements for implementing the Convention. The Code should accompany the Council’s conclusion decision and describe the division of roles between the EU and the Member States in implementing the Convention. We have been discussing legal competence issues, as well as issues such as reporting and sharing information.  Some Member States, regretfully, are still reluctant to support EU accession to the Convention. Let me reiterate again that the EU will accede alongside the Member States and will not replace Member States. Substantial aspects of the Convention, such as those related to substantive criminal law, remain under Member States’ exclusive competence. However, the advantage is that, if the EU becomes a contracting party in its own name, alongside the Member States, certain obligations set out in the Convention will be legally binding for the EU’s institutions, bodies and agencies and will therefore protect their staff. For example, the Convention requires that staff are protected through the internal rules of the institutions to prohibit violence and harassment in the workplace and provide for procedures and services to support victims and to sanction offenders. The Commission is currently in the process of analysing the relevant obligations in the Convention, screening the existing internal rules, regulations and practices of all EU institutions, agencies and bodies, and determining whether there are any gaps in the current system. This is a task which will require the full engagement of all European institutions and bodies, and I warmly welcome the European Parliament’s cooperation in this regard. Unfortunately, achieving EU compliance with these international standards is not enough. Despite the fact that all EU Member States have signed the Convention and that 19 Member States have so far ratified it, we see strong opposition against the Convention in a few countries. A lot has been said about this Convention, some of which is frankly untrue. I would like to be very clear: this Convention is about protecting women against violence. Nothing more, nothing less. One—in—three women in Europe has experienced violence at least once in their life simply because she is a woman, and one—in—three women in Europe has experienced either physical and/or sexual violence. This is unacceptable.  The Istanbul Convention is the first binding and comprehensive international instrument in Europe that addresses violence against women. It is not about imposing new social standards. It is about banning violence. The misconceptions and misleading arguments voiced in the public debates about the Convention need to be confronted. The Commission is working on a communication strategy to rebut fears that the Convention would challenge conventional family or religious norms or introduce an obligation to allow same-sex marriage or a new refugee status for transgender or intersex persons. I would really like to know in which universe social conventions or religious norms would allow for violence against women. Which religion does that? (Applause) Gender equality is not a quick fix. We all know that. But unless we take concrete steps and move ahead together on this, we won’t achieve the behavioural and cultural shifts that allow change. I say this: I’m a son, I’m a husband, and I’m a father of two girls. I find it completely unacceptable that my mother, my wife or my kids – my girls – would not be better protected against violence. This is a duty shared by men and women. It’s not only up to women to make this happen, and this is a duty we should all take very seriously indeed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, the signature of the EU on the Istanbul Convention was a historic step to strengthen our tools to prevent violence, combat impunity and protect victims. Since then, Estonia, Cyprus, Germany and now Croatia have ratified the Convention, but 10 Member States are missing, including the Presidency. I am asking them: how many women have to be harassed, beaten up and killed? How many girls have to be married away, mutilated or trafficked for prostitution before they ratify and enforce?  All women and girls should feel free and safe in Europe, and no tradition or culture can justify men’s violence against women. The EU accession to the Convention strengthens accountability for Member States and external action of the EU in promoting women’s rights globally. It is about building a culture of respect for women and girls involving men and boys. The Convention not only provides for sanctions, training, support for victims, but also measures to combat stereotypes and sexism.  So together today, let’s call on the Presidency to put the Istanbul Convention on the agenda of the European Council for as long as it takes, and call on all countries – Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and Ukraine – to engage with civil society, with religious leaders, across political parties based on facts. Thank you, Vice-President for what you said. Let’s also call on the Commission to open a dialogue on the misleading interpretation of gender in the Convention. The Convention is not against family – Mr President, I’m finishing – it is against violence that is against families.

But this anniversary is by no means a celebration, because after a year of negotiations between the Commission and the Council, no significant progress has been made. You can feel that the negotiations are progressing and that some of the Member States are of good will, I sincerely thank them. But here we need unanimity. Poland or Hungary - to name a few - refuse any progress on the file. These governments have turned their backs on half of their populations, who risk becoming victims, denying our right to live free from violence. And what force of conviction of the Bulgarian presidency of the Council, which withdrew a bill for the ratification of its own country. No wonder the negotiations at European level are dragging on. The Council has already restricted the scope of the Union's accession to the Istanbul Convention. He chose to limit it to a few specific areas, while this Parliament called for the widest possible membership. The legal arguments to justify these regrettable restrictions were also rejected by our Legal Department.

I emphasize that these are the worst crimes against women, such as genital mutilation, forced abortion and forced sterilization, child marriage, rape and honor murder. People can and should have religious beliefs, but this should never stand in the way of protecting women. I cannot understand and accept that culture, customs, religion, tradition or so-called \"honor\" can be an excuse to oppress and abuse women. I ask all of you: What is honorable about violence against women? And how can fighting violence not be in line with traditional values? I deeply regret that it is proving so difficult in the EU to send a strong signal against violence together.

It has also been signed by all countries, including the European Union, and most of them have ratified the convention. Croatia has recently done so, which deserves great applause. The Istanbul Convention is recognized by the United Nations as the gold standard of anti-violence policy. It includes a chapter on prevention which says that promoting equality between women and men is the best way to prevent violence. The convention recognizes that nothing can justify violence: neither tradition, nor religion, nor culture. Some religious customs, such as circumcision of women, are considered to be violence and a punishable offense. This convention is a roadmap for national anti-violence policies.

Thank you, President Tajani, for your kind introduction, and thank you, the Members of the European Parliament, for giving me this opportunity to contribute to this series of debates with members of the European Council on the future of Europe. It is a pleasure and a privilege to be here. Winston Churchill once said: ‘Politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year. And to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn’t happen.’ Churchill was right, we can’t predict the future. Unexpected events will always occur. But as politicians, it’s our job to lead and to chart a course. It’s our job to set goals and make choices that help achieve those goals. And looking at Europe and the world today, it’s clear: the European Union needs to make choices. Choices about its course and its role in the years to come. I must say, my personal views on the importance of the EU have evolved over the years. Yes, there is a transactional, ‘bread and butter’ element. Member States all benefit from the Single Market, the monetary union and the free movement of people. But it’s just as important that the EU ensures security, stability and the rule of law. The mere fact that we work together, that we are embedded in this Union, makes us stronger, safer and more effective. More and more, I’ve come to view the EU in this light. It’s something we in the Netherlands felt in the aftermath of the downing of flight MH17 in 2014, and yet again after the decision to hold Russia accountable for its part in it. The EU united behind us, jointly calling for Russia to accept responsibility and cooperate with efforts to establish the truth and achieve justice and accountability. We are grateful for the support and unity shown by this Union.  Russia has continued in its denial; its baseless criticism of the investigation and its obstruction of the truth are a stark reminder of how much we depend on all parties uniting to achieve justice for the victims and their loved ones, and of the importance of upholding an international, rules-based system aimed at fostering peace and justice.  So today, I stand before you with a real sense of urgency. Because recent developments make it very clear that we cannot take our way of life, our way of doing business, or our way of conducting international relations for granted. The multilateral order is being challenged in a way that we haven’t seen in decades, and the geopolitical balance of power is shifting. This global dimension of Europe’s future is the first thing I’d like to highlight today. Because if we want to be able to act, if we want to determine our own future, Europe must stand united. Now, more than ever. We must deal with the fact that Russia has chosen to distance itself from its neighbours in the West. We must deal with the ongoing conflict in Syria, and the arc of instability around Europe. With countries like China and India, which are stepping up their presence on the world stage, projecting greater self-confidence and a clear agenda. And with all the challenges and opportunities this brings for the EU, as the world’s biggest trading bloc and as a leading force for peace, stability and development. Even the relationship with our most important ally is no longer self-evident. The USA has unilaterally pulled out of the Paris Climate Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal. It has imposed import duties on steel and aluminium, triggering a debate we thought was obsolete. But of course, we remain friends and allies. I personally have always been a strong believer in the transatlantic bond. We need to keep working as closely as possible with the USA. But we must also deal with the fact that the rules-based multilateral system is under severe pressure. Since 1945, that system has greatly benefited Europe as a whole and the world around us. Indeed, the EU is the most successful example in world history of how multilateralism and the willingness to compromise can bring about unprecedented security, stability and prosperity. The EU is the ultimate example of the power of international cooperation and free trade. We know from experience that progress requires give and take. We know the value of seeking common ground, shared interests and sensible compromise.  So let us broadcast a strong message to the world: that Europe’s belief in the power of multilateral cooperation and free trade is as firm as ever, and that the EU Member States stand united in this, however much pressure we face. I like to compare it to the wagon trains in those John Wayne westerns that I watched as a boy. The settlers made a conscious decision to jointly undertake the difficult journey westwards. Before setting off, they agreed to stick to certain rules. Rules on conduct, speed of progress and care of the sick. And when evening fell, or danger threatened, the settlers circled their wagons. Their unity gave them strength, stability and security. It’s the same with the EU. Unity is the bedrock of our strength. Unity defines our ability to act.  Sadly, Brexit will leave a big hole in our circle. The only positive effect is that it has made the other 27 Member States even more aware of the importance of unity and working together. As a founding member, the Netherlands is committed to ensuring that our circle stays strong; that the EU remains successful and effective, that it continues to improve the lives of hundreds of millions of people. For the Netherlands, EU membership is self-evident. Because the Single Market has brought greater prosperity for more people than the founders of the EU could ever have imagined. Thanks to our shared values, most Europeans and more Europeans than ever before, enjoy legal certainty and protection. But I must be frank. I firmly believe that a truly strong and unified Europe must embody that famous quote by Goethe: ‘In der Beschränkung zeigt sich der Meister.’ ‘Mastery is revealed in constraint.’ Or, to put it another way, ‘less is more.’ More and more Europe isn’t the answer to the many problems that people face in their daily lives. For some, ‘ever closer union’ is still a goal in itself. Not for me. ‘Unity’ and ‘ever closer union’ are not the same. You don’t achieve unity by simply doing more in more areas. You achieve it by doing things really well in a few important areas.  So I believe we should be working towards a more perfect Union, which safeguards our way of life and delivers practical results. The EU needs to under-promise and over-deliver. Because focusing on our core tasks will promote the Union’s effectiveness, strength and identity. And it will boost unity. I believe that the future of Europe should essentially be about the original promise of Europe: the promise of sovereign Member States working together to help each other achieve greater prosperity, security and stability. But we can only deliver on this promise if a deal is a deal, and if the difficult compromises we have to make apply to everyone, and in full. Europe isn’t a menu you can pick and choose from. That is – and always has been – the basic promise and the basic premise of our unity. So let me be very clear: the debate about the future of the European Union should not be about more or less Europe. It should be about where the EU can add value. Where can cooperation achieve more than the Member States can achieve in isolation? Where does it make sense for sovereign Member States to make a positive and conscious choice to work together?  Originally, it was the Single Market and international trade policy. Then came EMU and the euro. Then, more recently, we added the common migration policy, joint control of our external borders and our collective security. Of course, there’s climate policy – by definition a cross-border issue. These are the areas where the EU needs to focus, because here Europe can achieve more than the sum of its parts. The challenge is to ensure that we do confine ourselves to these areas. And that we actually deliver on them. A Europe that adds value, sticks to its core tasks and achieves visible results can count on public support. That is why, once again, we need to under-promise and over-deliver. So for me, the debate on the EU’s future starts with the questions: Is the EU still doing the right things? What new priorities are emerging? Where does the EU need to do things better, or differently? When it comes to new priorities, climate policy and climate policy is a case in point. The current EU target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40 % by 2030 predates the Paris Climate Agreement. But it isn’t enough. Not if we’re to play our part in keeping global warming below two degrees. Let alone aim at one-and-a-half degrees, as we agreed in Paris.  So for a Paris-compatible EU target. we need to raise the bar. I am proposing a 55 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. (Applause)  Not only to meet our obligations, but also because a competitive and forward-looking Europe is, by definition, a sustainable Europe. Can it be done? Absolutely! As long as we, the Member States, Commission and European Parliament, all make it our goal.  That’s what I’m asking you today. Together with countries like France, the Netherlands wants to lead the way on this new climate ambition, and to work with you to achieve it. Exactly as we’ve done before. I still have a very clear memory, dating from the Dutch Presidency in 2016, of how we tackled the refugee crisis in record time through a big, concerted effort. As co-legislator on border control measures, you played a major role. Let us show once again, in this other, more insidious crisis, that Europe can take responsibility, and that together we can achieve a great deal. And this brings me to what we need to do better. It’s an important question, because the EU has a tendency to make new agreements before existing agreements have been fully implemented. We all know the ultimate example: the Single Market. There is so much more we can achieve in the field of services and the Digital Single Market. According to this Parliament’s estimate of the cost of non-Europe, we’re missing out on over a trillion euros a year. So, with respect to the EU’s original promise and its future: this is what it’s all about. Here, too, I have something to ask of you, especially the representatives of the larger Member States that are at this moment in no hurry to open up the market for services. I hope you won’t hold it against me, as Prime Minister of a country with a smaller domestic market and a long history of international trade, for mentioning the elephant in the room. We need to team up to unleash the full potential of the Single Market. Because we can’t pass up an extra trillion euros a year. (Applause) Another area where we could do better is the eurozone. We’ve come a long way, and the EU has shown that it can take action when it has to. But we are not sufficiently prepared for another crisis. The basic promise of the euro was that it would bring us all greater prosperity – not a redistribution of prosperity. That together we would achieve greater affluence. The pleas now being made to establish a transfer union fly in the face of this promise. Yes, I know that a currency union needs stabilisation mechanisms at times of crisis. But if the 19 eurozone countries were to put their own budgets and national debts in order, this would probably be stabilisation enough. That, too, is simply an existing agreement under the Stability and Growth Pact. A deal is a deal.  Of course, if – after putting its house in order – a country suffers a financial crisis and there’s genuinely no alternative, we should help each other, as good neighbours. We created the ESM, our collective safety net, precisely for that purpose. But we need to do things in that order. Let’s not forget, we already have hundreds of billions of euros available in the EU budget to support structural reforms at national level. I strongly believe that we should use these resources, these existing resources, to fulfil the original promise of the euro, a higher level of convergence and competitiveness for all. Let’s use the tools we already have in place. Let’s make sure that the Commission and the Eurogroup work together to achieve this goal.  And yes, of course we must do better on migration. We must be prepared to tackle the next migration crisis. We must resist the unchecked influx of migrants and work harder on return. We really must take steps now to make the European asylum system fair and effective. If we fail to take these measures – collectively – we risk losing the advantages that Schengen has brought us. I applaud the work done by the Bulgarian Presidency on migration, and by the way, I congratulate Boyko Borisov on his birthday today! Mr President, Members of the European Parliament, the debate about the future of Europe, about old and new priorities, is also at the heart of the debate on the next multi-annual budget. To the Netherlands, it is only logical that the budget should shrink after Brexit. And within that smaller budget, it is only logical that wealthy states should pay more – but not disproportionately so. The Netherlands is willing to pay its share, but countries with a comparable level of prosperity must make a comparable net contribution per capita. Member States’ financial contributions need to be proportionate and reasonable: that’s how we see it. But figures aside, the Netherlands sees the next budget above all as a chance to show that the EU is serious about reform, by re-assigning funds to tomorrow’s priorities. We can’t solve today’s problems with yesterday’s solutions. We can’t face the twenty-first century with a budget that reflects the realities of decades ago.  At present, agriculture and structural funds swallow up 70 % of the budget. Spending less in these areas will make room for new priorities. We also need to reform the very substance of these policy areas, to make them fit for the future. That, too, is only logical; and it’s necessary. We must show the people of Europe that we practise what we preach. Because, as the old Dutch saying goes: trust arrives on foot and leaves on horseback.  In many countries, the EU’s democratic legitimacy, as well as public trust and support, are under pressure. For the future of Europe, perhaps our most important task is to regain that trust one step at a time. Of course, the democratic legitimacy of the EU has various dimensions. There’s the formal, institutional dimension. And that centres on the fine balance between the members of national parliaments and you. I’m not giving away any secrets when I say that the Netherlands attaches great importance to the role of national parliaments. Because that is where we must address the question of what Member States can do better themselves, and what should be a matter for the EU as a whole. In other words, how taxpayers’ money should be spent.  Here, in the European Parliament, proposals for European laws and rules are discussed, amended and adopted. Here, implementation is monitored. And here, plans and proposals by the Council and the Commission for the future of the EU are weighed and discussed. In this way, national parliaments and the European Parliament together provide the EU’s democratic legitimacy. But there’s also a less institutional dimension. Because legitimacy and realism are extensions of each other. So the EU needs to listen to what the citizens of the Member States want from it. And especially, what they don’t want. And it has to act on that. I believe that delivering on the EU’s basic promise is crucial if support for the EU and unity are to be preserved. Yes of course, there can be no democratic legitimacy without the rule of law. Let me be crystal clear on that point: ours is a union of laws and values. Membership of the EU is not a statement of intent. It means opting unconditionally for freedom of the press, an independent judiciary, legal certainty and all those other democratic achievements that bind us together as a community of values. (Applause) It’s literally part of the deal. When you’re in, you’re in all the way. This is a pressing issue for this Parliament too, I’m happy to say. Those who say that the rule of law is a purely national matter are wrong. The people of Europe can flourish only if the rule of law applies in all Member States.  (Applause)  Our citizens need to trust each other’s legal systems. And businesses need to know that their investments are safe, and that any disputes will be resolved by an independent judiciary. That’s why it’s vital that countries do what they agreed when they signed up as members of the EU, and that the Commission monitors this rigorously and independently. Ladies and gentlemen, friends, one of the founding fathers of the European Union was Johan Beyen, a post-war Dutch Minister of Foreign Affairs. In his memoirs, published in 1968, he refers to the story of the giraffe that Julius Caesar brought back to Rome from one of his campaigns. It’s said that the Romans weren’t sure what to call this strange animal. Eventually they settled on ‘camelopard’, because it had a neck like a camel and spots like a leopard. Beyen wrote: ‘Europe is like a giraffe: an animal difficult to define, but easy to recognise.’ And fifty years on, that’s still a good description. Because Europe’s wealth lies in the diversity of its Member States and the regions, the histories, and all the different languages and cultures. That can’t be summed up in a few words.  At the same time, Europe is easy to recognise as a community of values and as a united partnership. It’s a circle of covered wagons that gives strength and protection, and that’s my core message. We don’t have to agree on everything – and we probably won’t today – in order to recognise the value of unity in a fast—changing world. That unity, ladies and gentlemen, is the future of Europe: our future.

That’s always a good thing to do. Listening to Prime Minister Rutte, I was thinking about one of the most important contributions the Dutch nation has made to Europe, as it now stands. I have to take you back to 1581 when, after a long struggle with the Spanish King, the Dutch Parliament (if you could call it at the time the States General) declared that, since the King did not perform his duty vis-à-vis the Dutch population, he had in fact left the throne – vacated the throne. This ‘Act of Verlatinghe’ is the first document in European history where it said that sovereignty is in the hands of the people, and for them to give to the rulers. I think this has later also been the inspiration for the Declaration of Independence in the United States and for the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen in France, and therefore it constitutes, I believe, an essential element of today’s Europe and our values. I wanted to take you back briefly to the Dutch Republic because the Dutch Republic, once it had obtained its independence and freedom, flourished incredibly to become a world power. And the elements of that were openness; entrepreneurial attitudes; audacity (to try and sail all over the world), but also respect for diversity; curiosity about what is different; openness to other religions and other beliefs; putting an end to persecution of people who had different beliefs. It’s interesting, if you follow Dutch history, that in those times when we were open towards what is different, we did well. And in those times when we became introspective, we became afraid of what is different, we set our backs to the outside world, we declined and we became irrelevant in world politics. I think this applies to Europe today, and I really, on behalf of the European Commission, want to thank the Prime Minister for the sense of urgency he has expressed today before this Parliament. This sense of urgency should be guiding what we do right now, because the unthinkable has become possible. Who would have said five years ago that the European Union can break up and disintegrate? Nobody. It was gratuitous to attack the European Union and its institutions, because they were unbreakable anyway. And now we’ve seen, as a consequence of the fourth industrial revolution, as a consequence of all these crises we’ve had, that the European Union is not unbreakable – which means that it’s valuable. Something that is breakable and fragile can be extremely valuable, and that is the European Union. So this is the time for people who believe in the European Union to stand up and come together and show unity, and this is precisely what the Prime Minister has advocated today. And I warmly welcome that. What is creating this brittle element in our Union? I believe, to sum it up, it is, arguably, moral hazard. The Union functions because Member States trust each other that they will do what we agreed collectively. This trust has been eroded over the last ten years: between north and south, east and west, within the west, within the east. If we do not confront the issue of moral hazard, if we do not take that away, if we do not take that out of our Union, how could we ask our Member States and our people to share their destinies? I can only share a destiny with someone I trust and can rely on when I’m in trouble. If that is not the case, I will withdraw, because it is too risky for me. I believe that is where it starts, and that’s my own very urgent call upon the Prime Minister, as a Member of the European Council. If I look back over the last couple of years, what is the issue that has brought the European Union to the brink? It’s the issue of migration. The issue of migration has played a key role in all of our Member States, wherever we are, and only if we, as a European Union, can convince our citizens that we do have an answer to this – not denying migration, not pretending you can solve it by building fences and building walls, not pretending that you can solve it by just letting everybody in – if you understand that we need a comprehensive approach on the migration issue and that only at European level will this comprehensive approach be valuable and work – if we cannot convince our Member States and our citizens of that, then we will be in the same situation as the Dutch citizens were in 1581. You have vacated your seat because you are not capable to deliver to the citizens what they demand as your sovereign, namely security and management of a migration issue that will be with us for generations. And I would call on the Prime Minister to use everything he can during the upcoming European Council to try and help the Bulgarian Presidency bring the issue forward. I feel strongly supported by what President Tajani said yesterday when he called upon the European Council to see what Parliament has done in this line of work, to see what Parliament and Commission have proposed together. I think this is a good basis for a solution of this problem. We cannot leave our Member States alone with the issue. This is something Europe needs to solve. That is being big on big things. One of the challenges that is new to us, which comes from the outside, is the fact that, for the first time since 1945, we now have a President of the United States who apparently believes that a disunited Europe is more in the interest of the United States than a united Europe. This is completely new and a paradigm shift. Again, this calls for Europe to be united, and I, these days, remember very well John F. Kennedy going to Berlin and at Berlin’s worst hour, saying to people in Berlin: ‘I am one of you, I am one of you and I will make sure that you will continue to live in liberty’. That’s an American President I am inspired by. Also by Ronald Reagan, going to Berlin again and saying to Mr Gorbachev: ‘tear down that wall’. That is an American President I’m inspired by, and he helped the great European liberators Wojtyła and Wałęsa to do what was necessary to bring freedom to the whole of Europe. That is an American President one can be inspired by. (Applause) I would echo what the Prime Minister said: the foundations of our relations with the United States on the basis of our values are extremely strong and cannot be destroyed by one president and one administration. The more unity Europe has on the basis of international rules, on the basis of our values, the more chance we will have to help the Americans return to that same path. Because we are linked – our destinies are linked – with the Americans’ because we share so many values. In conclusion, I would also like to echo what the Prime Minister said on the nature of our unity. After 1945, our unity was built on a tripod of democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights. This tripod is indispensable if we want to maintain and strengthen our Union. You cannot use democracy against the rule of law, nor can you use the rule of law against democracy, nor can you use those against respect for human rights. This is, by the way, how it worked in times of dictatorship in Eastern Europe: when we would criticise democracy, they would say: ‘but our constitution describes it’. So they used their so-called rule of law (which was in fact rule by law) as justification for not having democracy. But you cannot do it the other way round either. You cannot say: ‘because I’ve got a majority, I can do with the rule of law whatever I like. I am the rule of law!’ (Applause) If that is your position, you return to the rule by law, which is at fundamental odds with the nature of our Union. I want warmly to thank the Prime Minister for now saying very clearly, on behalf of the Dutch Government, that, yes, the instruments of the Union are important: our common market (and we need to perfect it – a lot to do); our common currency (which is not perfect yet – a lot still to do); finding a budget for the European Union (which is not perfect yet; we made a proposal; I think it does comply with some of the criteria set out by the Prime Minister, but that’s all up for debate – we’ll get there). But all these things have no importance and no value if they are not founded on the basic values that brought Europeans together after such a long period of strife and dictatorship. Our freedom is founded on our values, not on our markets, not on our currency, but on the values we share.

It is good to have him here. After the G7 weekend – or should I call it the G6 weekend – I want to focus on External Affairs in my contribution today. Some would probably say that after Donald Trump, in three or seven years’ time, the old system of partnership with America will come back, but I don’t think so. I think we are at a historical moment, at a crossroads, and I think we have to decide in which direction we want to go as the European Union, as you also said in your contribution. The alternatives are clear: national egoism – that the European Union is a community of those who are dreamers of the past, of the empires of our history or whether we are a real global power as Europeans. The positive thing is that the decision is in our hands; we decide about our future. The need is obvious. You mentioned MH17. I want to underline that you have the full support of my group and I think of the whole House, that we have to find the persons responsible and that Russia has to contribute to an independent investigation. But having this concrete point in mind, Prime Minister, the key question is: how do we come to conclusions in external affairs in the European Union because today, foreign affairs policy is – frankly  speaking – horse—trading in the European Union. A continent of 27 Member States with 500 million people can be blocked by only one country in this European Union and we are obviously weak in this regard. We have a friendship group of China inside the Council, we have a friendship group of Russia inside the Council, a friendship group of Iran in the European Council. You can buy countries at the moment to get influence in this European Union and you can block everything. (Applause) That is why you have to answer one concrete question. The Commission will come up with a proposal to use the Lisbon Treaty and change the unanimous decision—making process on external affairs, to switch to majority decision—making. If we don’t do so, we will be weak. If we do so, we will be strong. We need your answer on this concrete question.  Another aspect is our priorities for our external affairs activities. I think the Middle East is key; the EU is the biggest donor but with the least impact in the region. Can we use our humanitarian power to create peace in Syria, yes or no? And on Africa, which is probably the biggest priority for all of us, we have to take an open market approach. Trade is key for creating development in Africa and a Marshall Plan is needed. There I want to reflect on the MFF discussion. You spoke about the MFF, and first let me underline that I do not think it is fair when you talk about the proportional burden—sharing in the European Union, because the mechanism of financing the European Union is clearly linked to GDP: so 1% is 1%, 1.1% is 1.1% and 1.3% – which is the idea of the European Parliament – is 1.3%. So it is proportional in every way, so don’t tell the people that this is not proportional what we are doing here; the key question is whether we are ready to finance the strength of the European Union when we make new investments in the defence fund, when we make new investments on a Marshall Plan for Africa and when we want to have strong border control, with additional Frontex officers, then we have to finance this and you have to finance this.  I want to add, on the subject of external affairs, also some general ideas. We need a clear understanding about what is our role as Europeans in this global development. Today’s world – and Frans mentioned this – is dominated by ‘America first’; egoism against partnership. Our history was the same, the history of Europe: national egoism against partnership. Then we had a game—changer; we had the creation of the European Union as a game—changer – a way, a mechanism, to find solutions in a civilised way. Having this in mind, dear friends, I think the European Union is probably a model for today’s world – being less than a nation and more than an international organisation, and a key to solving problems and avoiding conflicts, today’s European Union is probably the alternative to the Donald Trump approach. Ladies and gentlemen, if we have this in mind, I think we also have to talk about the hard power of the European Union. We are talking about the military activities of our continent. We have done a lot with PESCO now in creating a headquarters. Please allow me on this aspect only to pick out one detail, because, Prime Minister, you talked about respecting agreements on a European level, so I want to ask you about the implementation of the PNR Agreement because this is also an important security aspect but it is not fully implemented in the Netherlands. Coming back to military activities, I want to ask you what you think about creating common initiatives in this field. My group believes that in drones and in cyberwar, in new security challenges, we should from the beginning start with EU forces, with EU activities. In the long term, we have to work for a European army, but in the short term I think it would be much more cost efficient if we could do this together from the start.  Finally, if you allow, I want to say that the headline for our External Affairs Policy should be what Europe is all about. The European Union is a force for peace, is a power of peace. In Iran we showed that sanctions worked and the treaty works. It is better to have an agreement than to send troops. The same in North Korea. And even in Ukraine we told our friends that weapons will not create more peace. So Europe is a continent which stands on a global level for peace. That is a great image for the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 54, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Udo BULLMANN", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, a warm welcome to the Prime Minister from the Social Democrats in the House as well. We listened to your speech and I have to admit I like the general idea of talking about urgencies. I like the general idea of talking about leadership, and if I got it right – and I am one of those you will find on the site, I also liked your metaphors, go west, because this is very familiar to this House: we are permanently detecting new ‘territoires’, new areas of our work, we are building Europe each and any day from scratch, in a new mode towards a new direction – and if I got it right, you were also talking about John Wayne’s spirit, which I like as well. But what do you think about the organisers of a trek to the west where the organisers say to the farmers: ‘well, the ‘territoire’ in front of you is dangerous, you will have bad weather, there is a multiplication on criminal gangs which you have to face, and to make you more efficient I provide you with less water, less food and less horses, and at the end of the day that makes you quicker, and you will with less resources get to the other side in a better way’. What do you think at the end of the day, how many of these farmers would have then ended up in California, and what do you think John Wayne would have said to the organisers, once the organisers would have tried to get him on board as a possible scout? So I have questions to this narrative, and I don't think that this narrative is in itself convincing. So please explain your position on the European budget, because this is my metaphor on that. I would also join forces with you and hope that we can have a joint initiative in making clear to Mr Tusk that Dublin reform and that the situation of the refugees in the Mediterranean has to be the top priority at the next summit – the top priority. And I would like to echo the interest of the European Parliament that nothing is postponed any more. My question is: can you support this position in the best interests of those people who are in danger of drowning in the Mediterranean, in the best interests of the dignity of the European Union and, to make it very concrete – talking to the experts in the house, for instance to my colleague, Liberal colleague in 't Veld this morning – also in the concrete legislation? This moment we are discussing, the Coreper is discussing the Reception Directive – close to a compromise. The only potential deal-breaker I hear is the Council insisting on a by-principle detention of children. What would John Wayne have said to this question that you by principle have to organise the detention of children, to have a reception culture for foreigners and for migrants and for refugees? You could take the lead (talking about leadership immediately), ask one of your guys, of your colleagues, to phone up your ministers and your civil servants in the Coreper and clarify on that, so that we perhaps get a solution already today. (Applause) Again, talking about a joint spirit (John Wayne again, forgive me today but it was so close to my heart): what would he have said to the leaders of a country where he had to pay taxes for the coffee he buys, but those who sell the coffee do not need to pay taxes? It would have been potentially a dangerous conversation with him, because what would have been his position on tax havens and the defence of tax havens like you see in the Netherlands? (Applause) So it’s an interesting question. Mein Schlusswort auf Deutsch. Man sagt ja zu Recht, dass wir uns gar nicht so unähnlich sind – was wir beide nicht so gerne hören, weder die Niederländer noch die Deutschen. Wir haben euch immer bewundert für die vielen Dinge, die Frans Timmermans aufgezählt hat. Wir geben es kaum zu: sogar beim Fußball, Fußball total. Es ist ja kaum einzugestehen, dass wir euch eigentlich sogar dabei gelegentlich bewundern. Aber was ihr machen müsst – und das ist mein Appell als regionaler Nachbar –, Herr Premierminister: Bringen Sie die Niederländer, bringen Sie Ihren Staat, bringen Sie Ihre Gesellschaft in die erste Linie der Reform der Europäischen Union! Wir brauchen die Niederlande als einen Reformfaktor, einen aktiven Faktor, um die Zukunft Europas zu bauen gegen die Populisten, gegen diejenigen, die Europa kaputt machen wollen. Sind Sie in der ersten Linie, lassen Sie uns Klartext reden! Das entspricht beider Mentalitäten. Keine Ausreden mehr: Wir müssen es gemeinsam anpacken.

We can just speak Dutch here. We have excellent interpreters. They're having a hard time right now, but you can't find better interpreters. In the European Union, the United Kingdom has always acted as constructive opposition, as a counter-force to the too often dominant Germany-France axis. In Berlin, however, there is an old trauma: one never wants to become dominant again. So in the end, within that German-French axis, Paris determines what is going to happen. That means, especially now with Macron, even more Europe. The United Kingdom's exit means that the European Union is leaving the country that has a sober and constructive counterbalance. It's high time for Europe 2.0: enter Mark Rutte! As one of the longest-serving European heads of government, he is the right person to organise that counterbalance. The moment is also very important. We are on the way to 2019: European elections, a new Commission, negotiations on the multiannual budget, and of course Brexit. European politicians such as Macron, Juncker and Verhofstadt are eager to move on. So now is the time for Mark Rutte to counterbalance, take over the scepter of the English and organize that counter-power. Rutte's speech in Berlin this spring provides a very good basis for this counterbalance. This also applies to cooperation within the euro area, in which he is trying to build it up in a sober way with a number of northern countries and Austria. So no United States of Europe, but a sober approach. A modest and, above all, subservient Europe that honours and connects agreements. So also a modest budget, not a eurozone that becomes a transfer union, and a European Union that helps Italy and Greece with the migrant issue. It is now time for such a European Union. Mark Rutte has to go to jail.

Welkom in het Europees Parlement. I have to tell you – I agree with you. The new world order needs a new Europe and it’s completely useless and unproductive to continue a discussion now, 20 years on, about less and more and more and less. What we need is not more or less – it’s new, it’s something else, it’s something different to the Europe we got in the past. I liked the word you used: a ‘more perfect’ Union, because a more perfect Union is a sentence in the American constitution, and in the American constitution, they are not talking about a bigger union or a smaller union – they’re talking about a more efficient union, a more united union, a more perfect union. It’s good to look to the past of the Netherlands, as Frans Timmermans has done, to see where we have to go because the Netherlands in my opinion, were robbed a little bit avant la lettre. There were seven independent provinces who worked together and beat the Spanish Armada, with a little bit of help from the Brits, but we have forgotten that, naturally, for the moment. The bad weather also helped them a lot. Afterwards, in 1602, Mark, what did you do? What the Netherlands did was unite the fleets, in one fleet, in one confederation, in one nation, establishing the Dutch Golden Age. That is the example that you have given to Europe, and what we have to do is to copy that by creating a European golden age in a certain way, a European golden age in a time where we are surrounded, I should say, by a circle of evil, and by that, I mean Putin. I mean Erdogan. I also mean, on a bad day – and that’s nearly every day – Mr Trump for the moment, for example, on trade matters. We need a Europe that is also in solidarity with you, Mark, and with the Dutch people and the Dutch victims of MH17, and I ask the Commission, President Juncker and President Tusk to examine in what way in the international court case in The Hague we can be in full solidarity with the Dutch in that court case – because the Russians continuing to deny their responsibility is a scandal, and Europe has to be behind the Netherlands and far more outspoken on that issue.  (Applause) But as we all know, Putin gets away with everything: the shooting down of flight MH17, the cyber—attacks against Baltic states, murders in the streets of London, killing of political opponents in Moscow, the illegal occupation of Ukraine and some regions in other Soviet republics. I think it’s time to wake up, particularly at a time when we have an American president who is more comfortable with autocrats than with his old Western democratic allies. That’s a wake-up call. That’s the inconvenient truth. The inconvenient truth is that if there were to be an attack by somebody on European soil tomorrow, we could not be sure that the Americans would help us. We need to take responsibility, we need to build up our own European defence community, and I agreed with Manfred Weber when he said we need to get rid of the unanimity rule in all these matters as soon as possible. It doesn’t make any sense to continue like that. Our problem is not only that we maybe have a different point of view on this issue. We have another problem, and it is that we have inside the European Union, inside the European family, a fifth column in our ranks. Let’s be honest – I call them the cheerleaders of Putin: Farage, Le Pen, Wilders and others. Their friends are sitting here and they are, in fact, doing only one thing: they take the money from the Kremlin, they take the intelligence of the Kremlin, like Mr Arron Banks, the friend of Mr Farage, who colluded and even contributed, with the help of the Russians, to creating Brexit. These people work together, in fact, with Mr Orban, but Mr Weber said nothing about Mr Orban today. I’m a little bit disappointed. It’s time that we stop this cooperation with people like Orban, Kaczyński and Salvini who are working with all these nationalists and populists. (Applause) I’m pleased that you talked about a Europe of values at the end of your speech and your introduction, as Macron did, as Bettel did, as Charles Michel did. In fact, we as liberals can never accept the illiberal plot of these people, and we and you have to be at the forefront to fight against them. Thank you.

Thank you also for your very clear words on the rule of law, on the bad situation that we see in several countries in the European Union. My question directly on that would be what exactly are you – what exactly are the Netherlands – going to do in Council to support the Article 7 procedure on Poland but also, when it goes beyond Poland, what exactly are you going to do?  I really appreciated your words as well about how unity works and how we all depend on each other because I think this is really true. We do depend on each other. If we work together well then we can all benefit from that, but if we work apart, then we will all lose out. You mentioned climate change as the obvious example of that, and I very much agree with that and I can only applaud the proposal you made on further reducing CO2 emissions to 55% in the European Union. This is a really good way forward because climate change is a threat to humanity and we need to act. We need to get our act together and we have to move first because if we don’t, no one else will do so.  But of course in order to achieve that, you will also have to talk with your colleagues and your neighbours. You will have to make sure you get a majority in Council because we in Parliament are not actually the problem – the others are the problem! – and the problem is the Council, so please go ahead, put some pressure on your colleagues to make sure that we get to that aim. Talking about dependency, I would also like to mention the fact that we are very much dependent on each other in economic terms. The economy is, I understand, a very central point in how you view the European Union, and even how you view the world. You have said that everyone needs to put their house in order. I think that’s not the first time you have said that you; you have said that repeatedly. But putting your house in order doesn’t work if you say everyone puts their house in order and everyone does their thing and then all will be well. This is because we have a common market, we have a current common currency, we are all interlinked and our economies are interlinked, so if one wants to export, someone else needs to import. This is how it works. We are all interdependent on that, and if everyone has to save and save and save, then who’s going to drive demand? You’ve been very critical again here today of others not getting their budget in order, but I would say one of the reasons other countries are not managing to put their budget in order is because of you – it’s your government and previous Dutch Governments which, by being a tax haven, through a long history of blocking and frustrating and delaying European action against tax avoidance. (Applause from certain quarters) With that you are taking away other countries’ income. Tax dodging by companies leads to costs of EUR 15 to 17 billion a year in the European Union. That’s money missing from our taxpayers. You have just agreed in the Netherlands – to please, apparently, multinationals like Unilever and Shell – to give a tax break to companies that will cost the Dutch taxpayers 1.6 billion a year. Out of the 20 largest companies in Portugal, 19 used Dutch letterboxes to avoid paying taxes in the midst of the economic crisis. So while Portugal was attacked for not saving enough, while in Portugal there were severe austerity measures, it was actually your country that helped companies avoid pay the taxes that would have helped Portugal. (Applause) So how do you expect Portugal to get its house in order, and why do you not cooperate with your colleagues in the Council instead of competing with them? Less tax competition would actually be more in this case! Promoting the single market might sound very pro—European in the context that we are all getting used to, but just sticking to free trade, deregulation, liberalisation, that is the recipe for a status quo. We need to get to a social union – we should not forget that the European Union is not just a market, it is a place where people live, work, experience inequalities, have social insecurities – and that’s where we need to get. We need to get to a social union because if we’re not having more social union, if we’re not having more solidarity in the European Union, then we’re not getting anywhere. The European Union should be more social, should have more solidarity or it will have difficulties being.

Thank you, Mr President, and a warm welcome also from Left Europe, my own group, to the Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr Rutte. As Peter van Dalen said: you can speak Dutch very well here. That's because we have very good interpreters. They are not having a bit of a hard time because their working conditions are being stripped further and they are not even entitled to strike. Our group stands in solidarity with this, and I hope that more and more groups will speak out in favour of the rights of interpreters. Because this does stand for something broader. If, even in this Parliament – which should be the home of democracy in Europe – people's working conditions and employment rights are no longer respected, if competition and market thinking is all that matters, Then I end up with Mark Rutte. Because in your speech in Berlin and in your speech here, the market is also central. Even when it comes to security and the rule of law, you want to give companies space in the first place. I think that's the wrong way. Let's see what the market has been good for: in the Netherlands, 10% of the population has two thirds of the income. The remaining 90% must divide the rest. Globally, 1% own half of the capital. The remaining 99% must divide the rest. That is what the market does, in the Netherlands, in Europe and around the world. That's what we need to talk about. What do you do for the 90%? The Greens have already said so. Where's the social side? What about honesty? Taxes play a role in this. We see that children currently have fewer opportunities than their parents had, that the future for people is less good. Those are the things we need to address. Equal pay for equal work, you said in Berlin. You have not repeated that now, but that is a real problem. Although we have made progress with seconded people, they still have social contributions and pensions in their country of origin. So there's not really equal pay for equal work. This week and at the last Strasbourg meeting, lorry and bus drivers were at the door. International road transport does not have equal pay for equal work. What do you do for the 90%? What do you do for them? And then there's the cultural side of the matter. We have nothing against entrepreneurial spirit. That is good. But what we do have a thing for is playing people off against each other. What do we do to connect people? Are we going to a society (albeit a rule of law) where everyone is pitted against each other? Or do we come to a society that connects? Do we go beyond market thinking? There is regular reference here to Trump. But what does it owe its popularity to? He owes it to the steelworkers in Detroit, who feel left alone and feel that they are victims of globalisation. The Commission has also pointed this out. If you don't address that, you'll get the opposite of what you probably want. Then you get people standing up to each other. You'll get insecurity. And we're not going to get any further. One more comment on the 1%. You're in that one percent. So are the big investors. Those are the big multinationals. I would advise you to take a look at Investigate Europe. This is an NGO that has mapped out what BlackRock is proposing as an investment company. BlackRock manages 6.3 trillion US dollars. Blackrock is currently attacking collective pensions in Europe. We all need individual pensions. BlackRock can make a living on that. That's why it wants a pan-European pension product that you endorse per person. That's going in the wrong direction. I want a europe of solidarity. And I would like to hear your vision of a europe of solidarity. I'm making one proposal: what if we regulate that market? Let us attach a social and green protocol to the European Treaty. The trade union movement proposed this years ago for the social aspect. Since you are now green right, you probably want to agree to the attachment of a green protocol. So let us test everything about solidarity and sustainability and rein in the market. Wouldn't that lead to a Europe that really connects, that is really stable and that prevents us from sitting here with a Trump?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 60, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Gerard BATTEN", "mepid": "28497", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, Mr Rutte, you spoke about listening to the people, but in Holland, of course, in 2005 you had a referendum on the constitution. That was ignored. We got the Lisbon Treaty, which was the Constitution in another form, in 2016. The Dutch voted against the Ukrainian Association Agreement, and that has been ignored. The EU rule is to pay and obey, so if you can change that, then good luck to you. Now, Europe can have a great and prosperous future, but not if the European Union is planning it. The European Union is responsible for many of the problems that beset Europe, and your solution is always the same: to have more power. The European Union was always about creating an undemocratic state – a ‘united states of Europe’ – and it has always been about deconstructing nation states and transferring political power to Brussels. That would be bad enough in itself, but you have actually made a complete mess of governing the Member States. There are two areas in which this is obvious to the ordinary citizen: the economy and security. The creation of the euro was a political project, not an economic project, and was an entirely predictable disaster and has brought about financial austerity and unemployment. The dead hand of European bureaucracy impedes business and makes it increasingly harder for small businesses to operate, to create new jobs and to grow prosperities. Your policies have blighted the lives of millions of people. Meanwhile, our security is endangered because of the results of mass immigration. Under Mrs Merkel’s leadership you have brought in millions of people from Africa, the Middle East and beyond, and you intend to bring in millions more. You have turned many parts of Europe into foreign countries. You use the emotional blackmail argument of talking about helping defenceless refugee families, and yet the reality is that the vast majority of these migrants are young men from Islamic countries. This is not immigration, this is invasion. (Shouted comments from the floor) Traditionally, Europe resisted Islamic invasion. Heroic struggles in the Siege of Malta, at the Gates of Vienna, have now been replaced by abject surrender. Islam offers two options: submit or resist. (Interjection from the floor: ‘Rubbish’) You have decided to surrender and submit on behalf of your citizens. But some states are resisting. Rebellion is now stirring in Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and elsewhere. The tide is turning against the EU, and best of all, we have Brexit: a modern Peasants’ Revolt against their out-of-touch overlords.

I guess we will see him quite often in the future when he has accepted the position of Mr Tusk as President of the European Council. When we discuss the future of the EU, we most certainly must address the situation of the rule of law in the Member States. The majority of this Parliament has serious concerns about the rule of law in Hungary, Poland, Malta and Slovakia. Therefore it has started the monitoring group on the rule of law. Your party is a member of the ALDE Group, and a colleague of yours in this Parliament, Ms in’t Veld, presides over this monitoring group. I advise this monitoring group to take the Netherlands as a reference case. In the Netherlands, the prosecution doesn’t have the obligation to follow up on any reported offence. It is at the discretion of the Prosecutor’s Office whether to take action. Therefore, millions of citizens in the Netherlands see prosecution as a political tool. This was recently confirmed in a report by WODC, a scientific institution that advises the Dutch Government. The report stated that over the last decade there has been no prosecution of extreme—left violence. I will give you another example. Last month, a group of rejected asylum seekers looking for a place to stay broke into a house near Amsterdam, claimed the property as theirs and tried to chase away the inhabitants. Although this attempt failed, the state prosecution didn’t want to take legal action, and they allowed this behaviour. To me it’s absolutely clear that applying the law to one group and letting another off the hook creates legal inequality. It breaks the rule of law. These are the Netherlands of Mr Rutte and Ms in’t Veld of today. I have some serious advice for Mr Rutte with regard to his European ambitions. If you want an EU where the rule of law applies, start at home. And I quote: ‘get your house in order’, and have the prosecution take action against illegal activities in general, not just against so-called populists. A second issue I would like to address is illegal migration. The EU is in a complete deadlock on how to deal with illegal migrants. The EU has no solutions. It doesn’t close its borders; it doesn’t expel rejected asylum seekers; it doesn’t fight Islamisation and radicalisation. So I urge Mr Rutte to distance himself from Ms Merkel’s ‘refugees welcome’ policies and endorse the Visegrad approach. He could start by making it a criminal offence to help illegal migrants, rejecting asylum to migrants who enter via safe third countries, and making asylum seekers who go on holiday in their home country lose their right to stay. When you are President of the European Council, recommend the whole package that we proposed yesterday to the Member States.

I’ve got three for you, sir.  The first one concerns trade. You’ve made the point that the Dutch economy depends on trade with the United Kingdom as a result of the Rotterdam effect. I do appreciate the point you made about the Single Market and why, therefore, you would want the United Kingdom to remain part of that, but you’ve also effectively admitted the issue of punitive tariffs post-Brexit making no economic sense for your own country. Can we ask, therefore, that you champion not only support for a free—trade deal for the United Kingdom post-Brexit, but that you also champion free trade change within the remaining European Union Member States? My second question: you raise the issue of rule of law and electoral process. You, I hope, will be aware of billionaire George Soros, a fifth columnist, to use a phrase used this morning, interfering in a democratic referendum result on Brexit in the United Kingdom. Can I ask, how would you deal with that sort of political interference and how will you try and influence European Union policy to stop that degree of national affront to democracy and affront to national democratic process?

First of all, to the First Vice-President of the European Commission, thank you very much for your gracious remarks, dear Frans. You made this point regarding moral hazard. That was exactly right, since there is a lack of trust which crept into the European Union over the last ten years because of moral hazard. I was very happy that you made this point and we have to work on that. You also made a point regarding migration, and other speakers in this first round also made a point on migration. It is also crucial to come to an agreement at European Council level. We are very much pushing to make that happen at the European Council at the end of this month. But it is not easy, since, at the moment, there are still a lot of debates going on between the North and the South, as well as with the countries in the East. Regarding this whole notion of solidarity, of burden sharing, and of making sure that everyone is involved and that we find an acceptable compromise, I’m not very optimistic at the moment that we will reach conclusions at the end of June. We need your help there, and the European Parliament can push for this. Mr Bullmann also made this point in response to you on this issue.  On the situation with the United States, this was also a point made by Mr Weber, Guy Verhofstadt and others. I was always raised with the absolute conviction that the transatlantic bonds between Europe and the United States – anchored not only in a joint security imperative, in the fact that we share values across the Atlantic Ocean, and that we share the same type of history – make it crucial that together we keep working on the transatlantic bonds. It is not easy, but I cannot foresee us resolving any major crisis in the world without the United States. For our defence, it is crucial to keep the dialogue with the United States going, even if within that family relationship we have some serious quarrels at the moment. And, yes, Frans, you can count on the Netherlands where rule of law is concerned. I know that you personally, within the Commission, are working very hard on this.  Ms Keller you made a point about Article 7. Let me assure you that the Netherlands and my government are squarely behind Frans Timmermans and the entire European Commission on this issue. There can be no doubt, and I am happy that I know that the whole Commission is behind it.  Mr Weber, on the issue of the Multiannual Financial Framework: yes, I agree that we have new priorities which we need to address. But at the same time – and this is also a point I would like to make to Mr Bullmann – we have to acknowledge that 70 % of the European budget at the moment is spent on the priorities of yesterday. Why not think about what we can do in terms of making savings there to free money up for new priorities? Mr Bullmann, you made this analogy again with John Wayne. However, when John Wayne and his people were back in those days when that story played out, when the United States was working on pushing its frontiers westwards, there was no government to help them. There was no central system. It was the farmers themselves, making sure that, by putting their wagons in a circle, they could create safety. Luckily, at the moment we have governments and we have collective security. Absolutely, we need to work with our members, but considering this budget and what you need to do, we cannot just discuss new money; we also have to look at where we can find the money. I am simply against the 1.3 %. If you really want to make the parties at the extremes much bigger than they are today, keep on pushing for 1.3 %. It’s the best recipe. On PNR, I completely agree with Mr Weber. The legislation to implement PNR has been submitted to our Parliament and is being discussed in our House. We have already set up our national organisation and notified the Commission. It is not yet through Parliament, but we are working on that. At the moment, I believe that 14 countries have implemented this legislation. Half still have to come, and we are in the second half and working on that.  On the military side, military mobility is one of the things the Netherlands is pushing at the moment within NATO and within the EU. We are very much behind the initiatives President Macron is making to get a more effective basis to organise defence within the European Union. At the same time, I would argue that we should not now push for new symbols like a European Army. These are symbols. We have to make sure that we get things done in practice and that we get, in that sense, a satisfactory result for our citizens. I am not in favour of these symbols like the European army. I am very much in favour of working in the next five to ten years on practical things like, for example, military mobility. I know that I can count on your Group on this important priority.  On the issue of taxation, we acknowledge the importance of combating tax avoidance, both for the Netherlands and at the EU level. Taxation is an important issue in this House, but particularly in the parliaments of the Member States. Taxation is a key element of the political systems in our democracies, and in the Treaty they are therefore part – and I believe rightly so – of the Member States’ competencies. We are working at this moment on letterboxes and how to make sure that we take the necessary next steps in that regard. I was very happy to see that Commissioner Moscovici was very appreciative of the Dutch initiative in that regard. This is also in reaction to Ms Keller and Mr Bullmann.  It was Mr Peter van Dalen and Mr Udo Bullmann raising the issue of reform, and whether the Netherlands are pushing reform within the EU. Yes we are. We are pushing for radical reform. Yes, we are working on new alliances within the EU. The fact that the UK is leaving means that we in the Netherlands, which is the fifth—largest economy in the European Union, have to work on how we are going to organise our relationships with other countries. Of course, our relationships with Germany and France will always be crucial. When I listened to President Emmanuel Macron’s speech in the Sorbonne last September, I agreed with most of the points he made there. We have agreed to work together on issues like migration, the G5 Sahel, external borders, and in particular on climate change and pushing for this 55 % CO2 emissions target.  At the same time, we are working with other countries to find a balance within the EU to make sure – with the UK leaving and therefore the power balance shifting – that we in the Netherlands also try to work on new alliances. Yes, indeed we are working closely together not only with the Baltic States and the Scandinavian countries, but also with Austria, Ireland, and Spain, as well as with Portugal on other issues; it can be bilateral, it can be multilateral. Within the EU, that helps to achieve sensible decision—making.  Therefore, it is much more nuanced, in response to Mr van Dalen, than saying it is a counterbalance to France and Germany. The moments they agree on a policy are very scarce. Sometimes it is good that they can agree on issues, because they are the two biggest Member States, but there is no automaticity that when they agree, things are pushed forward, and it is not an automaticity that they agree. In many cases, as we all know, they very much disagree, and that also helps the debate in those areas.  Ms Keller, you also have to do something. Yes, I have to work; I agree. The Dutch Government, together with France, has to work on this support for the 55%. But please don’t leave it to me. You have this big House here. We had the applause, so please help. We have to do this collectively. That’s exactly the plea I was making in my speech. I need the European Parliament, because without your pressure – including in your Member States – to push for that emissions target, we will never get there.  Mr de Jong, of course we disagree on many issues, not on the Dutch language, but on many other issues. But still, I would argue that you were bashing the free market. Thanks to the free market, hundreds of millions of people in the last ten to fifteen years have been lifted out of poverty worldwide. Thanks to the free market, let’s not forget that. (Applause) On one thing we fully agree. I did not mention it in my speech, but the same pay for the same work in the same type of circumstances is at the core of the belief of the Dutch Government, and we will push for that. I know that collectively we are working to make that happen, including in the transportation sector.  Mr Batten, you addressed Brexit. I would like to remind you that the Governor of the Bank of England has calculated that the cost of the United Kingdom leaving the European Union is already GBP 900 per average British family. That is the cost that British families are already paying, and that will rise.  (Mixed heckling and applause from the floor) Maybe not for you personally, but this is happening at the moment. What I found in the Netherlands is that this fact, as well as the fact that it is hurting our collective security, is the best argument why the others need to work more closely together. So in that sense, thank you for that, but I am still very sombre and pessimistic about the fact that you are leaving the European Union.  Finally, Ms James, on Brexit: let me assure you that the Dutch Government is squarely behind Michel Barnier and what he is doing as our negotiator in this process. Can you help to make sure that we get more clarity from the British side as soon as possible, particularly on the issue of the Irish border? I believe that it is crucial to move and push that subject, which is important for all of us, forward.

Prime Minister, you have said that the EU must promise less and deliver more. I agree with that. But let's make it concrete. A large number of parliament's proposals have been considered by the Commission but are still stuck in the Council. I would like to return to the area of migration. You said, it's hard, I'm not optimistic. But think along. Angela Merkel has talked about flexible solidarity as a solution to this problem. Surely you have to come up with a migration policy with all countries, which starts in the countries of origin, which means stronger border protection and that a country does not leave alone when many refugees come. In my office there is a spell in Frisian, yet our other national language. I will spare you the Frisian, but in Dutch it comes down to this: if it can not be done as it should, then it should be done as it can. I think that is what is at play in the debate on migration. Angela Merkel calls this flexible solidarity. Think along. What might it look like? I would like to make two other points. As far as national parliaments are concerned, I agree with your plea. We can come up with very complicated constructions to get them more involved. But let us start with the documents in the Council, which are often unnecessarily classified, which prevent national parliaments from doing their job and we are less so. This parliament is open and transparent. Please help us to make the Council open and transparent. Finally, I come to my final plea. You were right to talk about a fair internal market, or about the complete ing of the internal market, including in the digital field. How do we make this digital single market fair?

Yes, I am leaving for the Luxembourgish Government. When Guy Verhofstadt says that we need a new golden age, I think he is right, but I think the golden age for a lot of Europeans was before Margaret Thatcher and neoliberalism. It was also before ten years of – I think for a lot of Europeans – brutal austerity politics. It was surely also before this kind of tax competition. So when I go back to Luxembourg next week, Mr Rutte, I think I have the same job to do in my government as you. I do not think we can leave taxation policy in unanimity. We need at least to take energy and environment taxation out of unanimity, as well as corporate taxation and probably also taxation for the very wealthy, because otherwise we are undermining solidarity in Europe. Colleagues, if you want to give me a big gift, we can build on your 55% climate. Today and next week we will be finalising, hopefully, the efficiency legislation, the renewables legislation and the energy and climate framework legislation. So what should be the target for 2030? 33, 33, 55: isn’t that a good rhetoric? So that’s where we have to get today and then, in addition, we need a vision.

I am in the back of this in the angel box of this Parliament, right in front of you. Yes, you'll see me. We had a debate here yesterday on the future of economic and monetary union.

We knew that, but we still looked the other way for years, actually up to and including the financial crisis of 2008. Recovery works on this EMU are now really needed. But there are still very different opinions on this. I would like to return briefly to the creation of EMU. Many economists and academics agreed at the outset that a monetary union cannot work without fiscal capacity. Nor is there any other monetary union in the world without such a budgetary and political link attached to it. Yet we have started this shaky construction. Political interests prevailed, economic laws had to be undermined. Therefore, this question: What do you think went wrong in the creation of EMU?

Thank you all for participating in this debate. I believe it is an excellent opportunity to discuss the big issues of the European Union and how we can work together. There were so many questions, I cannot answer all of them but I have tried to bring them back to basically four key issues. The first of them, of course, is the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). Ms Schreijer-Pierik, I am of course in favour of the common agricultural policy. It has to stay, but it also has to modernise and the whole budget has to modernise. We, as politicians, have to make choices in scarcity. We have to make choices about what we are going to spend our money on. I am absolutely convinced that we cannot just say there are new tasks which have to be funded and, at the same time, we cannot find savings in the existing budget. That is the plea I am making here. That is exactly what all the Member States have to do. I believe that simply saying we have to go to 1.3% again will only fuel the extremists who are saying that Europe is not making the necessary choices.  Secondly, on migration: here today I reach out my hand to Italy because I know that they have to deal with an extremely difficult situation. But I also eagerly await the Italian Government’s national measures because they have to do a lot in order to manage the inflow of illegal migrants better, and then they know that we stand ready to show solidarity and, as the European Union, to work collectively to address this issue, which no doubt will be with us for years to come. Ms de Lange rightly alluded to the Common European Asylum System, and we need, as part of that, to take out the root causes of migration. This is also my answer to Mr Bashir on this issue: better guarding of our borders and working on better return mechanisms for rejected asylum seekers. Again, I hope that I will be successful, with my colleagues at the European Council in June, in taking the necessary decisions although, looking at where the debate is now, it is not an absolute given that we will be successful on this. Many of you alluded to or discussed Schengen and the accession of Bulgaria and Romania. Let me be very clear on this: I welcome the fact that both Bulgaria and Romania have the aspiration fully to join the Schengen acquis. We acknowledge the work which has been done in Bulgaria and Romania on this issue, but we also know the work is not yet finished. Romania and Bulgaria need to meet several conditions that stem from joining the EU, as defined in the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism, one of the benchmarks of which concerns corruption – and, here too, a deal is a deal. We cannot have countries entering the Schengen area if they do not fulfil all the criteria. Another issue is that of which tasks the European Union should be working on. For example, one of the tasks raised by the S&amp;D Group is the issue of a social Europe. I believe that social affairs have to stay at a national level, but when social affairs have a cross-border impact then Europe also needs to get involved. Therefore, for example, this issue of making sure that people get paid the same amount of money in the same circumstances for the same type of work is an issue where Europe has a role to play, as it does in the area of transportation. I know that one of the speakers was the chair of the biggest Dutch union and I am absolutely convinced that, in those days, she would have fully agreed with what I have just stated. As I said in my speech, the European Union has to concentrate on its core tasks: those being, of course, the internal market, economic and monetary union (EMU), external borders, the issue of migration and, yes, the big issue of climate change. Finally, regarding the eurozone and EMU: as you know, a particular subject on the agenda for the European Council meeting at the end of June is the banking union. I believe that we need to take the necessary next steps on the banking union. But let me also go back to what was the basic promise of the euro, namely that it was not a redistribution of wealth but that our cooperation makes the cake bigger for everyone. That was the basis of EMU. I believe that EMU can deliver on this only if all the Member States get their house in order, which means aiming for sound and sustainable budgets and competitive economies through the implementation of structural reforms. When you do this, you will have not one big European mechanism to absorb macroeconomic shocks, but rather mechanisms at national level – 19 shock-absorption funds – and then you will not need additional stabilisation funds at European level. We also have to remain focused – and this is crucial – on structural reforms. They are essential for competitive and shock-resistant economies, and here, as I said in my speech, already at the moment in the MMF, we are spending hundreds of billions of euros within the eurozone on cohesion funds, on a common agricultural policy and on structural funds. My plea would be that the eurozone countries, together with the Commission, would give much clearer guidance on how to make better use of that already existing money in order to ensure that it fuels and supports structural changes in our national economies, because that would mean we were making better use of the existing money. The idea of the Commission proposals is to put some extra money in for the eurozone, but here I would say that we already have hundreds of billions of euros on the table and we can make better use of them. So, in terms of EMU reform, the main issue on the agenda at the end of June will be the banking union but also we will no doubt discuss some wider themes, and this will be part of my input to that debate. Thank you again for hosting me and giving me this opportunity. I thank the whole Parliament for this wonderful initiative and I will tell all my colleagues – six have already been here, I was number seven – that they should all come because it is useful, it is invigorating and it is also great fun.

You said that states must work with each other, that you understand the value of compromises and shared interests, but at the same time you support tax havens in your country and do not support interests for all European citizens! An eloquent example is the systematic opposition of Romania and Bulgaria's entry into Schengen, although for seven years they have met all the technical conditions! You said that the EU must take into account the position of national parliaments, but in the Council you take this into account, even though you said that the EU must listen to its citizens! All citizens, Prime Minister! Then listen to the millions of Romanians and Bulgarians, but also the citizens of other countries who are demanding the admission of Romania and Bulgaria to Schengen! You talked about unity, but add solidarity!

This is the u u u u,000th time we have come together to discuss the future of Europe together with one of the Prime Ministers of the Union.

From above, we are trying to tell European citizens what their future will look like and what is important in their lives. I think that is contrary to our mandate. We're sitting here representing people, not controlling their thinking. In April this year, the Eurobarometer conducted an EU-wide survey in which, among other things, they asked what the issues that are most important for the future of the Union should be, what the forthcoming European Parliament election campaign should be about. The survey clearly shows that the three most important themes are migration, terrorism and unemployment. I believe that these issues are far from being dealt with according to their weight, and when we do talk about them, we offer the rarest real solution. I find it difficult to imagine that the European citizens who are following this debate would sit back contentedly in their seats, because once again they feel a little safer about their future.

The EU was launched as a solution to strengthen Europe through peace, trade and cooperation. Instead, this has now developed into a machinery that, among other things, tries to persuade Member States to take in huge numbers of illegal migrants, especially economic migrants, often from the world's most dysfunctional and violent states and cultures. This happening fundamentally transforms many of Europe's countries at such a rapid pace that we have lost control. There is no room, time or incentive for the assimilation of these groups and soon no room for indigenous European cultures. The EU must now stop all migration in addition to a limited proportion of quota refugees, and stop any expansion of the EU.

So might it take a bit longer, and I do apologise for that. The last time we discussed the issue was on 12 February, and I thank the Parliament for the wide support for the Commission’s actions expressed in the resolution adopted on 1 March. Let me now give you an update on the current situation and developments which took place during the last months. First, a number of exchanges between the Commission and the Polish authorities took place at different levels. In particular, I travelled to Warsaw on 9 April, where I met the Polish authorities and members of the judiciary. On 3 May, I met with Foreign Minister Czaputowicz in Brussels. This meeting was followed by further technical exchanges on the new amendments by the Polish Parliament. On 16 May, President Juncker met with Prime Minister Morawiecki at the informal Leader’s meeting in Sofia. Now what about the concrete measures taken by the Polish authorities? Three laws were adopted in April amending the law on the Supreme Court, the law on ordinary courts organisation and the law on the National Council for the Judiciary. A fourth law was adopted by the same on 10 May. I welcome the change of the law, which provides now for a uniform retirement age for female and male judges, now fixed at 65. Also, the amendment on the assistant judges goes in the right direction. I also welcome the fact that there has been a willingness on the side of the Polish authorities to amend the laws on a number of other issues. However, I regret to inform you that, overall, and despite all of these legislative changes, key concerns which the Commission identified in the Reasoned Proposal remain unaddressed. I can summarise the situation as follows. First, despite the new amendments, the discretionary power given to the authorities in charge of deciding on the prolongation of the judicial mandates of Supreme Court judges and of ordinary court judges remains a key concern from the point of view of upholding the principles of the separation of powers and judicial independence. The current judges still have no right to serve their full term as originally established. Judges affected by the lowered retirement age cannot simply notify their intention to continue to adjudicate, together with a health certificate, and continue to work. The President of the Republic has wide discretion to decide on the prolongation of Supreme Court judges’ mandates. There are no specific criteria and there is no judicial review of his decision. Whilst the transfer of the power to decide on the prolongation of ordinary courts judges to the National Council for the Judiciary is a step in the right direction, this is undermined by the politicisation of the National Council for the judiciary. In addition, there is a very wide discretion, and again – sadly – no judicial review. Second, the risk of creating irreparable damage fully remains. On 3 July, 27 out of 72 Supreme Court judges will face the risk of being forced to retire. As you may know, the current Supreme Court judges were asked to declare their intention to remain in the court by 4 May. 13 judges reacted in one way or another to the new prolongation regime. Some judges submitted a formal declaration requesting prolongation of their mandate, whilst other judges made a general statement that they are fit and ready to continue to occupy their posts without making a formal declaration requesting prolongation, due to the unconstitutionality of such a procedure and its humiliating character. In its opinion, the Supreme Court explicitly stated that the lack of declarations of the other 14 judges cannot be identified with the lack of their will to further adjudicate. The situation of the First President of the Supreme Court is also very worrying. She is affected by the new lowered retirement age, and her mandate of a six-year term of office would be prematurely terminated two years early, despite the fact that it is the Polish Constitution itself which sets the period of her term of office. A forced retirement of these Supreme Court judges would constitute an irreversible violation of the rule of law. The Commission is at present examining this issue. Third, the reforms brought forward have only served to underline the crucial role of the new National Council for the Judiciary, yet there has been no corresponding increase in the judicial influence over the election regime of the judges’ members of the Council, so it still does not comply with European standards. Also, no remedy is foreseen to address the premature termination of the mandates of the former judges’ members established in the Constitution. The politicisation of this body that has occurred undermines its role as an effective safeguard of judicial independence. Fourth, I would like to recall that the new legislation offers no solution for those judges who have already been concretely affected by the reform measures contested by the Commission. I am referring to the Court Presidents dismissed by the Minister of Justice. I am referring to ordinary court judges already forced to retire by the lowering of the retirement age, including female judges subject to the provisions that are in violation of EU anti-discrimination law – and by the way, now they have announced they will change that: no misunderstanding on that. I am also referring to judges’ members of the former National Council for the Judiciary whose constitutional mandate was prematurely terminated. Fifth, recent changes do not eliminate the broadness of the criteria governing extraordinary appeal. They remain almost the same. In particular, they still refer to social justice, albeit in a different wording. The Venice Commission explicitly criticised such references. Also, the 20-year reach of the extraordinary appeal has not been eliminated, which means that the extraordinary appeal could result in the repeal of final judgments dating back to October 1997. A new condition was introduced, which aims at avoiding the extraordinary appeal resulting in the repeal of judgments infringing international obligations. This condition lacks real impact, as such repeal is nevertheless possible if justified by principles or rights established in the Polish Constitution. This could even justify, for example, the repeal of final judgments by Polish courts applying EU law as interpreted by the case law of the Court of Justice of the EU. Sixth, also other key issues underlined in the recent proposal and the fourth rule-of-law recommendation have not been addressed. As to the disciplinary regime, new provisions render it in practice highly possible for current Supreme Court judges to participate from the start as judges in the Disciplinary Chamber. The three Constitutional Tribunal judgments of 2016 remained to be published as such, without any additional qualifications about their legality from the legislative or executive powers. They have been published now, but with a disclaimer that they are, and I quote: ‘findings delivered in breach of law’. No legislative changes were made to address the concerns expressed in the recent proposal in order to restore the independence and legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal. Sadly, the Commission can only conclude that the four new laws adopted in April and May are not by themselves sufficient to remove the existing concerns and are not sufficient to eliminate the clear risk of a serious breach of the rule of law. The measures the Polish authorities have continued to implement over the past six months have already created damage and are continuing to do so. After the Constitutional Tribunal and the National Council for the Judiciary, it is now the Polish Supreme Court which is at risk of coming under political control. Last week, the Commission therefore asked the Council to organise a formal hearing of Poland in the context of the Article 7(1) TEU procedure. Finding a solution urgently is a matter of common interest for all Member States and all EU institutions. It is the Commission’s sincere hope that Poland will now urgently address the key concerns identified by us. In particular, it is indispensable that urgent action be taken by the Polish Government to address the situation of the Supreme Court judges before 3 July, because that is when the decisions about the retirements become final. I will travel to Moscow on Monday to continue the dialogue with the Polish Government in an attempt to find solutions for the issues I’ve just outlined. (Interjection from the floor, off mic: ‘You said Moscow’ and other comments off mic, to which Timmermans reacts by saying: ‘That is an incredible mistake – that has never happened to me before. I do apologise. Sir, if you knew anything of my personal history, you would not have made that remark.) As I said, I will travel to Warsaw on Monday to talk to the Polish government. You know the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties. That is our role. But we do this in a cooperative sphere. I continue to believe that it is through dialogue that we need to solve these problems. But I also continue to believe that dialogue needs to lead to concrete results so that we can remove the threat to the rule of law and restore the independence of the judiciary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 181, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Janusz LEWANDOWSKI", "mepid": "23781", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Today, the European Parliament, standing up for an independent judiciary and a constitution, is on the side of Polish citizens, and my vote should be a warning about the fate of Poles and Poles if the dismantling of the rule of law is brought to an end. Because these are institutions that guarantee freedom, which protect against abuses of power, and if they are lacking, you are vulnerable to the machine of the state. Poles know this, whose personal data was written down by a police officer only because they asked awkward questions to one of the ministers. This is known by a young man who unhappily appeared on the route of a column of government cars, and now is blamed for the crash of a government limousine. Anyone who enters into a court dispute with a neighbour will find out if the neighbour belongs to the ruling party. We also know what a misfortune political interference in the judicial system can be. The case of Thomas Command. The then Minister of Justice, today at the monuments, found him guilty in advance, as a criminal. Fast process. Annuity. After eighteen years in prison, it turned out that he was a completely innocent person. Fortunately, he is in the wild. The protection of independent courts is the protection of ordinary people. But there is more, because it is also the credibility of the Polish judicial system in the European legal area, also in the common market, where it is necessary to be sure of investing and obtaining investments. And the truth is known. It is contained in the documents of the Venetian Commission, the UN Human Rights Committee, in all the bodies and expertise that Western democracy has set up to establish the rule of law in a country. Unfortunately, the Constitutional Court is a façade incapable of assessing the constitutionality of laws. Unfortunately, there are more and more presidents in the courts who are more and less independent and less independent. Unfortunately, the National Council for the Judiciary was formed from a party key. But there is the last bastion – the Supreme Court. Only it is already wooing, because in fact already on 3 and 4 July 4 can be replaced 40% of the composition of this court as a result of forced retirement. And this is the body that evaluates the validity of the elections, so this is an existential problem of Polish democracy. Hence the dramatic calls for an action to be made to the European Court of Justice or even the suspension of this law, which, for example, saved the only Białowieża Forest in Europe from devastation. We talk about this in the centenary of Polish independence. Then, after an extraordinary victory that stopped the Bolshevik storm on the outskirts of Warsaw (we call it the \"miracle on the Vistula River\", 1920), Marshal Piłsudski, addressing the Polish youth, said: \"We have fought for the independence of your homeland, and you will live, work and rule in it. Remember. If you turn to the East, you will go back to culture and economics by a minimum of one century. If you turn to the West, poland will grow at least one age faster.\" So he left us in his will a definition of betrayal of the Polish ration of the state. He betrays the Polish right of state, as Targowica once did, he who wants to withdraw Poland back to the East again, who wants to weaken ties with the West, who wants to weaken the European Union. Telling the truth cannot be a betrayal. I expect a wave of hejtu, which will only confirm that I am telling uncomfortable truths. Defending the Constitution is a duty. Poland today needs constitutional patriotism, which is why, today, standing up for the Constitution, defending the independence of the courts, we stand up and insist on the rights of Poles and Poles.

Let me be clear. Our political Group appreciates the substantial contribution of the Polish people to restoring democracy in the east of Europe. We see the enormous progress the country has made since. We are also aware that not all aspirations have been met and that many people feel left behind. We understand that some people are angry. We have to be concerned. And if we don’t deliver, more and more people will turns their backs against democracy. The current discussion on and in Poland is about the state of democracy. It is worrying to see the signs from your country. Democracy, which your nation was so admirably fighting for, is in danger. All of us have the right to insist that a Member State is adherent to its constitution. We have to know that our partners are predictable. In Poland, the Constitution is at stake. We are concerned about the independence of the judiciary – a key element of every democracy. We share this concern with relevant authorities such as the Human Rights Committee or the Venice Commission, renowned scholars and friends of Poland around the world. Our Group was satisfied that the Commission has activated Article 7, and in March, Parliament explicitly welcomed this decision and urged the Council to take swift action. They acknowledged that this action put the Polish government in negotiation mode. But the results are poor and more or less cosmetic. The recommendations of the Commission have not been fulfilled. The Polish government continued its so-called reform of the judiciary. Almost 40 per cent of the judges will be forced into early retirement, and procedural rules are fundamentally changed. In less than three weeks there could be no independent judiciary in Poland any more. If the measures enter into force as planned, a large number of sitting judges of the Supreme Court will see their tenure unconstitutionally extinguished, including the First President of the Court. In combination with an increase in the number of seats, this means that the government-controlled National Council of the Judiciary will be in a position to appoint a majority of the judges. This could mean the end of checks and balances in your country. We must not accept this. It is against the Polish Constitution and against the Treaties, and it is against the people of Poland, who gave their approval in referendums for this. The situation is serious and urgent and we are obliged to act now – and not later, when democracy could be already severely damaged. This is not the moment for short-sighted political manoeuvres. After all the experiences with the Council (sorry), we must not expect that the summit at the end of June will deliver any clear results. Therefore, we appeal to the Members of the Commission to fully stand behind its Vice-President Timmermans. The Commission has to take strong action before July. It must refer this case to the Court of Justice.

Well, it is not as you say – these are not uncomfortable truths, and no one will persecute you for these uncomfortable truths. Unfortunately, we do not control the hejt, hejt happens, meets each of us. These are not uncomfortable truths. The Lord, simply, from exaggerated and isolated facts builds a certain narrative that has nothing to do with the country in which we both live. As for Mr Weidenholzer, one thing I wanted to say. I have recently visited your beautiful country and I can only say one thing: I can assure you that the rule of law in Poland, the separation of powers and everything we are talking about are no worse than in your country. So, although I appreciate your concern, I assure you that Poland is not very different from Austria in this respect. However, I now turn to the President. In your speeches at the end of that year (I myself listened to you in the LIBE Committee), you repeatedly regretted that the Polish Government was refusing to dialogue with the European Commission, suggesting a lack of goodwill and arrogance on the Polish side. This was not, in my opinion, a fair assessment. But, as we all know, the Polish government, after its reconstruction and change of prime minister, has since the beginning of the year made another attempt at intensive dialogue, seeking to reach an agreement with the Commission and, in our opinion, an unfortunate and unnecessary procedure for verifying the rule of law in Poland. But not only – and the President has said this – because the Polish government has come out in front of many of the Commission's demands, even if it considered them not very well-being, for example, there have been such demands on the age gap between men and women. The Polish has made significant changes and adjustments to the adopted regulations in recent times, among other things, weakening the possibility of influencing the organisation of the judiciary, strengthening the role of the National Council for the Judiciary and the President and not the Minister, publishing outstanding, but only archival, constitutional court verdicts, amending the rules on assessors, imposing additional conditions on the possibility of an extraordinary action, equaling, as the Commission wanted, the retirement age of judges of both sexes, etc. We could have constructed your speech quite differently so that you can talk about these compromises, not the differences. Poland has therefore done a great deal to reach an agreement and to take account of the Commission's reservations. Unfortunately, goodwill and a willingness to understand from both sides are needed to reach an agreement. It is regretable that the Commission represented by you does not want to show this goodwill and understanding. You probably think that, when you contact some of the legal circles and the opposition in Poland, you also have the support of Polish society in your actions. Mr Weidenholzer also seems to think that he is speaking on behalf of Polish and not only on behalf of extremely ideologised forces in Poland and beyond, for example in this Parliament, as is heard in the speeches. Nothing more wrong. All the data shows that the reforms undertaken by Law and Justice have great public support. In August 2007, 81% of Poles said they supported judicial reform. So that please do not rely here on Polish society, on Poles, as you are criticising here. The details can be criticised, but the need for reforms cannot be rejected. Poles know that this is not a violation of the rule of law, but a restoration of the rule of law, they know how the courts have worked so far, what their efficiency has been and what the quality and independence of their judgments has been. And now I will quote a non-Pole. Günter Verheugen, once the Eu Commissioner for Enlargement, recently said in an interview on one of the Polish portals: \"In my opinion, the European Commission does not have the appropriate powers to deal with this issue. (...) Of course, he has the tools to do this and can use them. However, I believe', sorry, Mr President, that is Mr Verheugen's sentence, 'that he is doing it ineptly. Commissioners do not know what to do. They also have no idea what will happen\", and that is also what we should take into account: the consequences of our actions. \"I have,\" says Verheugen, \"for all the parties to the dispute, one simple piece of advice – settle this dispute ... I am not an expert on these matters,\" he continues, \"but I know it's not just me\" and Polish colleagues obviously didn't know that \"the justice system needs Polish be reformed because it doesn't meet modern standards. The question is different – are we based on double standards or on the same rules? In Europe,\" says Verheugen, \"there are double standards, because Polish government is not out of these so-called mainstream.\" End quote. And finally, he added, very characteristically, \"Europe lives in an age of hypocrisy.\" Very aptly, in my opinion. Indeed, it is the secret of polystyrene that that there are many countries in the Union that deserve much more, Mr President, your concern and attention. I can tell you once privately about which countries would be. The solutions adopted in Poland are used in other countries, as you know. And as far as the political impact on judges or the tripartite power is concerned, I encourage my Colleagues in the European Parliament to look more closely at their countries, such as colleagues in Germany, I see that they are here, I would ask you to pay attention to that. Then maybe hypocrisy will be a little less. A little less hypocrisy in this House and a little less hypocrisy in this debate. Another prominent European politician, Bundestag President Wolfgang Schäuble, recently said: \"Looking at some of the discussions between Brussels and countries such as Poland and Hungary, but also the Czech Republic and Slovakia, I would like to advise you: let us not give the impression of arrogance. I understand that eastern European countries may sometimes feel that their arguments do not count.\" Now, to conclude: we, for our part, have done everything possible to put an end to this dispute, which is damaging to the Union. And now the Poles, for the most part, believe that the time for our concessions is over. We are therefore waiting with all peace and firmness for the commission and the European Council to move, and are, of course, ready to continue to inform and explain our position.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 186, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Sophia IN 'T VELD", "mepid": "28266", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, let me make three general remarks before I go into the issue of the complaint before the European Court of Justice.  First of all – and this has been said here before – we have no fight with the Polish people, because they are Europeans like us. We are all one, and we are just standing up for the principles that we have all signed up to. The interesting thing is that you just said that the eastern countries may have a view. Countries don’t have a view. In a democracy, within a country there is pluralism, something that you have difficulty recognising. My second general remark is that my group fully supports Commissioner Timmermans’ efforts to redress the situation in Poland and bring it back into the fold.  My third general remark: you were all shouting when Commissioner Timmermans by accident or by mistake referred to Moscow rather than Warsaw. But isn’t there a degree of hypocrisy there? Aren’t you also working very closely, for example, with Mr Steve Bannon? This is all on the internet. It’s all public knowledge. Mr Steve Bannon is clearly out to undermine the European Union and is also working with Mr Orban, who is one of the biggest supporters of Mr Putin. So this is all one big network. You all have the same agenda. So stop the hypocrisy because this is not about, let’s say, the retirement age of judges. What this is about is your party creating an authoritarian regime in Poland, and the Polish people deserve better than that.  (Applause) Maybe you could have the decency to hear me out just for once. It would be nice. The Treaties allow the Commission to bring a complaint against the reform law before the European Court of Justice – it has already been raised – and we would really urge the Commission to do that soon, before the deadline of 3 July. You have the power and the means to act, and you have the support of the majority of this House. This is urgent. The new law on the Supreme Court will enter into force on 3 July, in less than three weeks’ time. Everybody has already mentioned what the consequences will be. We have to avoid that, because otherwise we get what we saw in Hungary: the situation may have been redressed by Luxembourg, but by then a lot of judges had already been dismissed, and they never came back. That means that, in the end, there is still undue political influence on the judiciary. Since there are only a few weeks left, we would also urge the Commission to ask the Court of Justice for an interim measure to suspend the law until the case is resolved. So time is almost up, and we would ask the Commission to act now. We would therefore join all the people in Poland – NGOs, political parties, civil society –who have been calling for the Commission to take this step before the European Court of Justice. Why is this important? I am going to quote the President of the European Court of Justice, who in a speech said, ‘Judicial independence is the bedrock of our democracies, be it at national or European level. I would go as far as to say that judicial independence is part of both our common heritage and of our very identity as Europeans’. The effective protection of EU rights requires that the competent national court is isolated from any political pressure, and if it’s not, it means that the whole European judicial fabric no longer works and that there are big holes in there. We have already seen the Celmer case, in which an Irish judge refused to extradite a Polish citizen and did not respond to a European arrest warrant, but this will go further. We are talking about more and more connection, for example, of databases; we are talking about e—evidence; and we are talking about the European evidence warrant. All those instruments will not work – not just in Poland, but in the whole European Union – because, if you remove one part of the chain, then the whole chain will fall. So this is essential. But I would still like to urge the Commission not to focus only on the judiciary, but also to look at the rights of women and freedom of the media. I am also very concerned about the attempts of the government to exert control over the media. The integrity and independence of the advertising and measurement markets are crucial in this context. Poland has actually dropped from number 18 to number 58 in the world press index out of 180 countries. That should tell you something. So, all in all – and to finally also respond to your accusation that we are applying double standards, that may or may not be the case – I think it is an argument, Commissioner Timmermans, to quickly come forward with this general mechanism for the rule of law that applies equally in all the Member States so that we can easily rebut the accusation that was just made.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 187, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is first and foremost a union of values, a community of values centred on the equal dignity of every human person. To best protect these values, we have chosen a political regime, democracy. A democracy that is now being called into question at the very heart of the Union. Democracy is not just about universal suffrage. However, the electoral system must allow a fair representation of society in all its diversity. Citizens must be freely informed by an independent press. However, the bulwark of the separation of powers must be held against all abuses. It is precisely on this front that the Polish government that came out of the 2015 elections openly defies our common values. He took political control of the judiciary and is now attacking the Supreme Court, the last of which remained independent. We welcome the action taken by the Commission, which has not hesitated to trigger the procedure to protect the rule of law against Poland. But we must recognize that, to date, the results are meagre and that most of the measures in question remain in place. The Polish government also knows that it can count on its allies in the Council, in particular Mr Orbon's Hungary. And Mrs Panayotova, Bulgaria's absolute timidity raises the question: is it an embarrassment or a tacit complicity? Still, time is running out. If nothing is done, on July 3, many of the Supreme Court's justices will be dismissed, paving the way for the government to appoint a majority of judges in its hand. Together with our Polish friends, Mr Timmermans, we have written to you asking you to use all means in your possession to prevent this fait accompli. On behalf of all Poles committed to our common values, on behalf of all democrats, I reiterate this call to you today: urgently refer the matter to the Court of Justice of the Union. Beyond the Polish case, the judiciary is threatened in its essence in several EU states. It is not only in Poland that it is the subject of attempts to submit to the executive, and a submissive justice opens the way to all abuses of power.  Elsewhere, budget cuts, brutal or lashed, paralyze the judiciary in its primary mission, to deliver justice. Is it still a question of justice when years elapse between a crime or a misdemeanour and its punishment? Is it still a question of justice when citizens no longer turn to justice for financial reasons? Finally, in the name of counter-terrorism, Mr Timmermans, it has become common to put the judiciary out of the way. While no attack has ever been committed because a judge would not have issued a warrant in time, again, the door is open to all abuses. I invite you, Mr President, to exercise your mission as guardian of the treaties and our fundamental values without weakness or favouritism. No government, and I stress this, is no government, which is suspect, and I conclude Mr President, but none can be spared from your surveillance.

According to opinion polls, half of Poles misjudged the actions of the justice system. These were the days when judges at tusk's services tracked down internet users criticizing the then power. Then, Mr Timmermans, you remained silent when Poland was governed by a pro-EU agreement under the dictatorship of Brussels, which turned the leading role of Soviet Russia into the leading role of the European Union. You are worried about democracy and the rule of law, and it was in this House that a Member who pursued his right to freedom of expression was wrongfully punished.

The Union remains focused on taking away further attributes of sovereignty from national states. Poles, like all other nations, do not have to have the best governments and the best courts at all.

And there is no Constitutional Court at all, and the United Kingdom can function to its liking, and Poles do not grant this right! Moreover, The United Kingdom does not have a constitution at all, and somehow the European Union does not mind it, and allows the British to function to their liking. And poles do not grant this right! Poles want to have the right to decide on the functioning of their homeland without external interference. And I defend this right of my own people. Criticising Polish in such a way that one party is supported against others is an unacceptable and scandalous interference in the internal affairs of Polish. That is why the Union is increasingly seen as an 'Anti-European Union'. Lessons have to be learned from this, because it is really a misfortune.

So the agreement is that every time a country deviates from the predetermined rate, the others will shake it until it returns to that course. Because those who are now demanding intervention in Poland are also afraid that they will lose the elections at home, and expect that then grateful colleagues from the Platform with them will destabilize the situation until they return to power.

The Polish people decided to join the European Union. The Polish Government signed the Treaty on European Union, it was ratified by the Polish Parliament, elected by the Polish people, and that Treaty comes with rights and obligations. (Applause)  One of the obligations in the Treaty on European Union, described in Article 2, is to respect the values of the European Union and fundamental rights. One of these elements is the rule of law, and the rule of law cannot exist if you do not have a separation of powers and an independent judiciary. (Applause) This is not an obligation that has been thrust from the outside on the Polish people and Polish nation. This is an obligation that the Polish nation went into with their eyes open after a popular vote – I think there was a referendum, if I’m not mistaken – and this obligation was taken upon the shoulders of the Polish people and Government and they execute that obligation. The fact of the matter is that the Commission is the guardian of the Treaties, and if we believe that there is a problem with Member States executing their obligations, we have to speak up. The world championships will start tomorrow – you cannot play a game of football without a referee to make sure that the rules are applied. If the referee is ignored or doesn’t apply the rules, you can no longer play football – the game will not happen – and that is the same with the European Union. We are a rule of law— and treaty-based organisation and we demand respect for the rule of law by all members of that organisation. That is not imposing – that is doing what was agreed and what was voted for, etc. (Applause)  In that context, the European Commission absolutely does not dispute the right of the Polish Government to reform the judiciary, and there might be very good arguments to reform the judiciary if it is slow, for instance, or if it is not delivering the results people expect from it. But in reforming the judiciary, you still need to respect the independence of the judiciary. If you believe that through putting the judiciary under political control, you can make it a better judiciary, you are wrong and you are violating your own obligations under the EU Treaties, and that is the core element of our discussion with the Polish Government.  Let me be clear: we do not dispute the right of the Polish Government to reform its judiciary, but in doing so, it should not infringe upon the independence of the courts, upon the independence of the judiciary. I put before you today our very concrete concerns. I’ve been very specific – that is why it took me some time, and that is probably also why I made that mistake. But when we do this, we do this in good faith. We want to have this dialogue – that is why I am travelling on Monday to Warsaw. That is, in my opinion, very important because I hope we can find a solution. It is true what you have said, sir, that with the new prime minister, a new era started – because this prime minister is willing to at least talk to us and discuss with us and look for ways out. But where I do not agree with you, sir – this is not horse trading. We are not talking about ‘you give a bit here’ and then ‘you give a bit there’ – we’re talking about the independence of the judiciary and the rule of law, and the Commission is just trying to maintain standards and wants to help Poland avoid a systemic risk to the rule of law. That is our duty, I am bound to that duty, I will do my utmost, and – frankly – I have been trying for two and half years. You can’t fault the Commission for not trying to find a way out through dialogue. I’ve listened very carefully to Parliament today, I’ve taken careful note of your remarks, I will also inform the Prime Minister when I seen him on Monday of your remarks, and I hope we can then find a solution together, but if we cannot find a solution, the Commission will have to stand firm on these issues.  Once again, it is not an imposition from the outside – it’s just holding a Member State to the agreement they entered into in freedom and ratified in freedom in their Parliament.

In the early days of the Civic Platform government in 2007, there was a turn in policy towards Russia, the lifting of a legitimate Polish veto against the EU-Russia agreement, the conclusion of an unfavourable agreement with Gazprom, a further deepening of relations after the Smolensk disaster leading to the conclusion of an interstate agreement with the FSB, and a visit by the Polish State Electoral Commission to Moscow in May 2013 for consultations with the Russian electoral commission.  Mr Verhofstadt has a separate history of cooperation with the Kremlin, to which I will fully report at a different time. However, I would like to make it clear to both of you: My views on the Kremlin's actions are known, they do not meander, as in the case of both Lords. I am blacklisted by Putin.

This is reflected not only in the abusive use of power and in undemocratic reforms, but also at the level of communication. In Poland, the populist Law and Justice Party took over the Constitutional Court by legal administrative means when it came to power. They did so even without a constitutional majority. This was the key to the success of their further reforms. Then they began to systematically take over the media. And in 2017, with the retirement of judges and other legal means, they began to take over the judiciary. Let us not forget that in Hungary, it is yp'an example of how András Baka was removed from the head of the Supreme Court, without consequence. The initiation of the first EU Article 7 procedure has put a little stall on the Polish government, but it has not fundamentally deterred them: following Orban's pattern, they are trying to stall with communication tricks and a few false modifications. However, this is all a sham. While the EU digests and negotiates amendments with the government, a series of new judges are elected and fired.

Ladies and gentlemen, this debate comes at a particularly complicated time. The immigration emergency requires an immediate reaction from the European Union. The problem cannot be solved at national level, nor can it be solved by disputes between Member States. Polemics, contrasts and confrontations only risk alienating the solution to the problem. If we look at what will happen in the next few years, we cannot fail to decide very quickly what to do. In 2050 there will be two and a half billion Africans. If we do not act on climate change, against terrorism, against poverty, against drought, against famine and against poverty in favour of peace, we will have biblical migrations. There will not be thousands of people moving from Africa, there will be millions of people moving from Africa. And we continue to waste time, the Member States continue to discuss with each other without finding a solution. The European Parliament, which represents half a billion European citizens, has approved a reform of the Dublin rules which can be an excellent basis for comparison between the Member States, because we have not made a weak choice, but we have combined firmness and solidarity. So it's a positive choice. We are prepared to compromise and to reach agreements, but the next European Council cannot be left without decisions, because the whole structure of the European Union is at the end of it. What is at stake here is not the question of 'immigration yes, immigration no, what kind of immigration', what is at stake is the survival of the entire European Union. Let us be very clear: the Member States alone cannot solve the problem. So we need a short-, medium- and long-term strategy. I believe that in the short term it is to stop migratory flows, in the medium term to create a Libyan state that can be a partner of Europe and, in the long term, a strategy that must also be an important part of the next multiannual budget of the European Union for more investment on the African continent. The European Parliament will not give up on playing a leading role. We have worked hard – I thank all the political groups – there are concrete proposals and we demand that these proposals be examined by the Member States.  On Monday of next week we will be in Vienna to meet the next Austrian Presidency. I intend to make the positions of the European Parliament stand up to Prime Minister Kurz and I will reiterate this position to the Council when I take the floor. It is my intention to go to Niger to send a positive message to that part of Africa about Europe's intentions. If I am authorised, I will also go to Libya to follow up the European Parliament's mission and the document approved by the European Parliament. No one can say that this Parliament has not been at the forefront of trying to solve the problem of immigration, but we cannot give up on solving the problem. That is why I strongly urge the Commission and the Council to act. The polemics between states – those who are tougher, those who are most responsible – are of no use. It is only small slats that do not help to solve a historical problem, which creates great social alarm and which really risks causing harmful effects on the whole of the European Union.

From a humanitarian point of view, it is extremely disconcerting to see the same scene repeated again and again in which hundreds of persons risk their lives in flimsy rubber boats setting out from the Libyan shores. For many years Italy has received all migrants, regardless of where they were rescued, whether on the high seas or in the search-and-rescue zone of any neighbouring state. We should recognise the significant contribution by Italy, but Italy was not left alone. The EU has assisted Italy in terms of setting up the Frontex Joint Operation Triton, now Operation Themis, as well as Operation Sophia and a long list of measures to address the flow of migrants coming through North Africa. I refer here notably to the Malta Declaration of 3 February 2017, the implementation of which is ongoing and which was supplemented by the Commission Action Plan of 4 July last year. Italy has been very active in implementation on the ground, whilst Member State have contributed with funding for projects under the EU Trust Fund for Africa and by seconding experts to the EU agencies engaged in the maritime operational ‘hotspots’ and other migration-related activities in Italy. Our intensive efforts are reflected in the number of arrivals, which has decreased significantly. By 8 June this year the number of arrivals in Italy had gone down by 77% compared to the same period last year. However, the number of fatalities has not decreased to the same extent. This fact is a stark reminder of the desperation of migrants and the lack of opportunities they face in their countries of origin. Our strategy aims to address the root causes of migration by providing economic and social opportunities in the countries of transit and origin. I believe this is the right strategy. Apart from existing instruments to that effect – namely the European Union Trust Fund, the Partnership Framework, the Valletta Action Plan and EU Member States’ development assistance – more facilities have been developed such as the recently launched European Fund for Sustainable Development, which supports investment in Africa and in neighbourhood countries. The implementation of the European Investment Bank Economic Resilience Initiative is also very welcome. In the short to medium term, we should continue and intensify all the measures we have already undertaken in Libya and neighbouring countries. I can name some here but there is a whole range of initiatives: equipment and capacity building to enhance border management; the establishment of platforms to combat human smuggling networks; and support for international organisations to improve the horrific conditions in detention centres in Libya and promote voluntary return. We should also keep sustained pressure on the Libyan authorities and partners in the African Union to take a stance against the criminal activities that thrive in Libya and in the region, human smuggling and human trafficking of which migrants are so often victims. Our cooperation with the UN and the African Union has been very fruitful. Voluntary return of migrants from Libya was accelerated because of political engagement by African leaders and efficient groundwork by UN organisations. We need more of this kind of engagement from the region itself. The European Union cannot and should not do this alone. The fate of migrants in the Mediterranean Sea, even though we are fully engaged at our level, is not solely an EU responsibility. Coming back to the actual situation in the Mediterranean Sea, I believe that the different positions expressed by some Member States will need to be addressed in the Council. We need to find a solution that matches our common European values. We in the Council, in collaboration with all our partners, in particular Italy and the Commission, are pursuing this objective with vigilance.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 203, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   Membro della Commissione. – Signor Presidente, onorevoli deputati, volevo prima di tutto segnalare che sono d'accordo con Lei. Voglio anche ringraziare Lei e anche i gruppi politici di questo Parlamento per il loro sostegno. Il lavoro di questo Parlamento è importante per finire la riforma di Dublino in modo giusto ed efficiente per tutti gli Stati membri. La Commissione e il Parlamento lavorano insieme mano nella mano come sempre.   – Mr President, the events of the last few days concerning the Aquarius boat remind us of the gravity of the migratory challenge in the central Mediterranean and of its humanitarian implications.  We cannot turn our eyes away from what is happening, even after three years of progress in managing flows. We cannot afford to become complacent. What matters most is that people in a desperate situation were saved and helped. That is what counts – ultimately and always. I want to be clear on that. I will not enter into any blame game today. Everybody needs to take up their responsibilities and play their role in solidarity. In the case of the Aquarius boat, I welcome that a solution was found and I commend the decision of the Government of Spain. I would also like to commend Italy and many other Member States that are upholding our values and taking up their share of European responsibility for many years now. Just remember where we were three years ago and where are we today.  We should not lose sight of the efforts these Member States have made in the past and continue to make. Indeed, while the Aquarius will disembark in Spain, more than 900 people were embarked this morning in Catania, Italy. So Italy is continuing to take up its responsibilities. Our central objective is – and I think we all agree on this – to avoid people fleeing from poverty, persecution or violence in the first place, putting their lives at risk by embarking on perilous journeys. It puts people’s lives at risk. It creates tensions within our societies, as shown by the strong reactions on social media.  To this end, our action is much more effective if it starts before they embark on these journeys on the other side of the Mediterranean. On this we have already achieved results, and we have to continue strengthening our cooperation with countries of origin and transit in order to address root causes of migration and avoid people falling into the hands of smugglers’ networks.  Let me give you a few examples. Thanks to our good cooperation with the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), we have helped more than 25 000 migrants to leave Libya and voluntarily return to their countries of origin, and we have supported the evacuation of 1 474 migrants in need of international protection from Libya to other countries, including Niger, in view of their resettlement as refugees. Resettlement should be the normal way to Europe for those who need protection.  Finally, we continue to train the staff of the Libyan coast guard in order to enhance its capacity to carry out search—and—rescue operations at sea, which has so far resulted in 16 000 migrants rescued. We are strengthening our monitoring after training in order to ensure full respect of human rights. We also financially support Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia so that they can better control their borders and fight smugglers’ networks. Protecting the external borders is essential on both sides of the Mediterranean. Protecting our European external borders is and will remain among our top priorities. We have made significant progress since the establishment of the European Borders and Coast Guard, but we need to continue. We proposed yesterday to almost triple funding for migration and border management to EUR 34.9 billion for the period between 2021 and 2027, compared with EUR 13 billion in the previous period. This comprehensive approach delivers results.  The peak of arrivals over the past few days should not overshadow the progress that we have achieved in significantly reducing the migratory pressures in Italy. This year, arrivals to Italy have dropped by 78% compared with last year. So far, 13 000 have arrived this year, compared with 90 000 last year. But when migrants engage in dangerous, perilous journeys in the Mediterranean, our humanitarian imperative to help people in distress should come first. To truly prevent that situations such as what happened with the Aquarius, we cannot be satisfied with ad hoc solidarity. We need a comprehensive approach and rules to ensure that the responsibility of assisting migrants does not fall on the shoulders of just a few Member States. The Commission has used – and will continue to facilitate – an open and frank dialogue and it will continue to find durable solutions based on solidarity and responsibility. Migration is definitely not a challenge for one or a handful of Member States, but for the European Union as a whole and all its Member States. Our migration policy can only succeed if we work together in a spirit of solidarity and sincere cooperation and, most importantly, with trust. It will not succeed if each country proceeds with unilateral and uncoordinated initiatives or feels authorised to only look at its own national situation and interests. We are therefore looking forward to continuing to work closely with Italy and the new Italian Government so that we can continue to manage migration flows on the central Mediterranean route. But as I said before, this is not just an Italian issue – we expect all the Member States to join forces in sharing the solidarity and responsibility and addressing this truly common challenge. This is the essence of all our efforts, whether it is saving lives in the Mediterranean or better protecting our shared external borders or coming to an agreement on any formal common European asylum system as part of the comprehensive approach on managing migration better. Only united will we stand. It is very important for us to understand that it is part of the legacy of this Parliament and of this Commission for the years to come because migration will be with us for many, many decades ahead. We have to be better prepared, more united and resolved to provide solutions, always having as a priority how to save lives and protect those who are in genuine need of protection.

It is difficult not to be angry when we know that we can introduce laws on plastics and on litter, we can end roaming, we can even reform agriculture, but when it comes to migration, prime ministers remain stuck. Our message to the Council must be clear: leave no space for more raised fists and banging on tables, no more victorious hashtags, no more children born on the high seas, no more lives used to prop up the wannabe strongmen of Europe. Things must change. Now, in the immediate term, we must reform our Dublin system to one that balances responsibility with solidarity. We need to ensure that our borders are secure and our coast guards have all the resources they need. We must break – as has just been said – traffickers’ models. We must draw distinctions between those in need of protection and those seeking work. Those who need protection must be given it, but equally, those who do not must be returned quickly. On migration and borders, the budget has been tripled. This is welcome, but in the medium term, we need to think outside the box and look seriously into having EU-run disembarkation locations in safe third countries, with EU standards, where anyone saved from the dark sea can be disembarked immediately, rescued, vetted, processed in full recognition of their rights – by  EASO, for example – and either returned or resettled. We have the money to do it and we must find the will to do it. In the longer term, we must move from aid for Africa to investment which creates jobs and creates hope and allows for education and entrepreneurship to flourish.

The first is the issue of the great inability to tackle this problem definitively and structurally. We have heard a list of many measures, we have also listened to the multiplication of resources, but we have not listened to and we still do not listen to a single word about the desire to redistribute the large mass of migratory flows that arrives in a few countries.  This is the crux of the matter before us and until the European countries come into the perspective of ideas that need to be addressed in this area and give a clear answer, the risk is that linked to the great hypocrisy, the polemic of these hours, which is frankly embarrassing. Listening to soldiers on their borders to prevent women and children from entering into a polemic against other countries is genuinely inappropriate and totally wrong. This brings us to the third consideration, which is a paradox. I listen to so many speeches against anti-system parties in this House and we do not realise that the European institutions have had and are having the capacity to create the conditions for the growth of anti-system parties in all countries, even though they have positions of total opposition to them. In fact, those who ask for and have a tough attitude towards immigrants are growing, in order to be able to have the solidarity of redistribution, and those who, paradoxically, at the same time close their borders, having the same similar attitude, are growing.  I believe that Europe is facing a clear risk today. The desirability of one state or another is no longer in question, there is a question of whether Europe will have a future. And the immigration game is worth much more than economic, social and institutional matches.

The tragedy of the Aquarius is not an Italian problem, neither a French critic nor a Spanish solution: it is a comprehensive problem of the European Union. Nor is it a false solution that has been established with Libya, and I would like us to think of something: our relationship with the ghostly Fayez al-Sarrach government results in all migrants leaving Libya leaving the shores dominated by Fayez al-Sarrach. Crete is much closer to Libya than Pantelleria. No one leaves the territory of the Tobruk government, led by Jalifa Haftar. It's worth thinking and going from ideality to reality. An African solution needs to be established with local, national, tribal, African religious authorities, because what happens in the Mediterranean is not a rescue problem either, it is the last link in a tragedy that begins in Africa. And, therefore, if we are not able to establish a solution at source — originally – in Africa, all we will do is a humanitarian task, I would say to alleviating our consciences— of our aesthetic consciences — when we are eating and meeting, at lunchtime, some dead on the beaches of Greece or in the waters of the western or central Mediterranean.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, nothing, nothing can justify a country closing its ports to a ship full of humans in distress. Mr. Salvini used human lives to engage in political blackmail and, incidentally, electoral gesticulation. This is unspeakable.  Yet we understand and share the anger of the citizens of Italy, Malta and Greece, these countries on the front line of welcoming migrants, too often left to their own devices by other Member States.  From Salvini's Italy to Kurz's Austria, De Wever's Belgium, Macron's France, Orban's Hungary and Kaczynski's Poland, fortress Europe seems to have become the alpha and omega of a majority of European leaders. Under the guise of firmness and humanity, it is a matter of pushing back and containing from a distance, even if it means paying dictators or armed gangs to turn their country into an open-air prison. But let us face reality, the challenge of migration - as you said, Commissioner - will not go away. Between wars and persecution, hunger, climate change and economic exploitation, the causes that drive human beings on the path to exile remain burning.  If the heads of state and government, who often scoff at being leaders, bow to costly, inhumane and doomed answers, the European Parliament has taken a different direction, and like you, Mr President, I am proud to belong to an assembly that has managed to find a large majority to end Dublin's iniquitous system and replace it with a collective, responsible and united approach.  However, the politicians who sit here come from the same countries and belong to the same parties as the heads of state and government and their ministers. So tell me why what is possible for us here is impossible for them behind the closed doors of the Council? If Mr Salvini really seeks the solidarity of Europeans, he knows what he has to do: support Parliament's position in the Council. One thing is certain: by dehumanizing migrants to justify fortress Europe, it is our fundamental values that we are treading on. No one, no one is asking the European Union to take in the 65 million people displaced inside or outside their country! But Europe is far from taking its fair share in hospitality today.

I would like to address the representative of the European Council, who says that the European Union has supported Italy with Operation Triton. We are talking about Operation Triton, which provided that Italy was the only host country of all landings. So you understand that, if we are talking about Dublin, which still imposes the principle that responsibility remains with the countries of first arrival, if we take another step backwards and see the search and rescue operations that have to be carried out with landings only in Italy, then let us ask ourselves a question, which I have not heard from anyone so far. : because those who have the right to international protection, because those fleeing war and persecution, because those who are forced to leave their country of origin must arrive in Italy or Europe illegally?  The greatest contradiction and hypocrisy that reigns in the European Union is the fact that we want, on the one hand, to combat illegal immigration and, on the other, not to offer a legal alternative. The fact that those forced to leave their country for war and persecution have to pay the traffickers and have to pay the smugglers. So if we really want to talk about reforming the common European asylum system, if we really want to talk about cooperation, if we really want to respect the provisions of the Treaties and Article 80 on the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, then let us start talking about a genuine European right of asylum, let us start talking about legal ways of accessing the European Union, let us begin to give the opportunity for those fleeing war and persecution to arrive legally and safely. , without being forced to embark and cross the Mediterranean in inhumane conditions, without necessarily being forced to pass through Italy as a transit country.

It is a simple equation. You can run away from the problem all you want – some of the arrivals will go down and they are going down, not up – and people will make a political football of migrants and people will play a game between Member States. But remember: migration will not stop. At the forefront of our minds, we must retain the understanding that, here in this Chamber, we must show leadership. That requires us, in this window of opportunity, to go for Dublin IV, for all of those asylum files, and then to implement them and make them happen.

I do not want Commissioner Avramopoulos to do that, but your speech seems to be exactly recycled in the same words as he said three to four years ago, and absolutely nothing has changed. Indeed, today there is the novelty that, to the same things that are always said, is added the trend topic of the moment that is to say \"Italian populist government, xenophobic Italian government\", as someone said in a really disrespectful way.  But what has the Italian Government done? The Italian Government has done much less than all the other governments in the European Union, and I am not aware that the French government, Macron's pro-European government, was referred to by yourselves as a Nazi, xenophobic government for what it did in Bardonecchia with blitzes on Italian territory, where there were pregnant women and children. I am not aware that Macron was considered xenophobic for closing his ports or for what he does in Ventimiglia. And I am not aware that the Spanish Government, which was hot-refoulement, which is not what Italy did, has been referred to as fascist, Nazi, xenophobic, contrary to human rights and genocidal!  It did not happen, and then we begin to adopt the same yardstick and the same measure. What has happened in recent years is that Italy has been left alone by all the other States of the European Union. She was left alone to deal with an epochal phenomenon, a global phenomenon of a moving continent. It was logical that sooner or later someone, who may not be doing business on the skin of migrants, should have said: just cannot go on like this! So let us be serious and demand that all European states take their responsibilities, starting with France, which was the first to cause what happened in Libya...

I take from this debate that we all share finally – or almost all of us – the same objectives, and that is very important for us. There cannot be one and only one answer. There is no single solution and we all know that. No Member State can do this alone. It is impossible. The only way is to adopt all the missing elements and to implement a comprehensive migration policy. This policy starts with cooperation with third countries. It continues with the protection of our common European borders – our external borders. It is in line with a future-proof European asylum system based on solidarity and responsibility. It is very much relying on effective return of people that have no right to stay in Europe. It is completed by the creation of legal pathways to come to Europe and by effective integration policies for those legally living among us. We need to continue our common work and our joint efforts in all aspects in parallel.  As regards some of the points you raised – Mr Corrao and many of his colleagues here referred to the support given to Italy – we have worked continuously and relentlessly over the past three years to ensure that much greater solidarity is shown to all Member States facing disproportionate migration pressures due to their geographical situation. I want to commend the Herculean efforts made by Italy over these past years. The Commission – and you all know that it has stood and continues to stand by Italy politically, operationally and financially – has granted more than EUR 653 million to Italy under the EU migration and home affairs funds to date. On top of that, we have offered EUR 193 million in emergency assistance. The European Borders and the Coastguard Agency Deployment is currently deploying 260 experts for Joint Operation Themis. Eighty asylum experts from Member States and interim staff have been deployed to support the operational activities. Europol guest officers are present in several hotspots and 12 963 persons in need of international protection have been relocated. We are also working closely with Italy to prevent departures from northern Africa. We have invested EUR 200 million in Libya to assist migrants, and EUR 46 million for border management. We will also grant Tunisia EUR 25 million for a border management project. As I said, this approach has brought results. Arrivals in Italy have decreased significantly. I look forward to working with the new Italian Government to ensure that arrivals decrease even further.  As I said during my introductory remarks, I am not here to play any blame games, and anyway it doesn’t help. The Aquarius incident shows that we need structural solutions and that solidarity cannot be an ad hoc or one-off thing. This is the essence of our discussions on Dublin, on stronger external borders, on cooperation with third countries and on our proposals today for more migration and borders funding.  These are European challenges which require genuine European solutions. This is not the responsibility of Italy alone or of Malta alone or of Spain alone. This is the responsibility of the European Union and its Member States as a whole.  Under these very pressing circumstances, and given the experience and the lessons we have learned over the last few years, we should reiterate our determination to safeguard the principles and unity of Europe in a spirit of responsibility. We should stand as one, guaranteeing a future-proof, balanced and fair European migration policy. All of us here have a great responsibility to show leadership and to ensure the unity and cohesion of our societies, avoiding divisive rhetoric. Migration has become a challenge for our unity. It is up to us to turn this into an opportunity, into a strong bond among EU institutions, among Member States and among our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 265, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, honourable Members, Commissioner, I have listened carefully to your views on the humanitarian situation in the Mediterranean Sea. The topic is of crucial importance, and it is my hope that we will be able to find a common solution quickly. The migrants certainly deserve that but so do our constituencies. We shouldn’t forget that most of the refugees and asylum seekers, particularly children and women, were affected by war and terror in their home countries. Migration is one of the major humanitarian challenges that the European Union is currently still facing and, as we discussed together yesterday and today, we need a holistic approach to migration management. The European Union response to this challenge has two main dimensions: strengthening the instruments for limiting irregular migration and addressing the root causes of migration. Many of you referred today to the reform of the Dublin Regulation system and – sharing the common understanding that the European Union needs a properly functioning common asylum system – the Council has not stopped working to enhance the security of our citizens, to strengthen border control and to manage the migratory process more efficiently. The Council has listened to you carefully and we welcome Parliament’s input in this debate. The Bulgarian Presidency fully shares your concerns and the sense of urgency around the need for asylum system reform which is both effective and protective. So we are doing our best to advance. We have proposed a qualitatively new approach to the Dublin Regulation. We are working not just on general principles but on the legal text of the regulation, article by article, and on concrete solutions. So we have built into the Dublin Regulation a new crisis mechanism for managing the migration and asylum systems in the Union when under pressure. The Presidency proposal provides clear criteria defining levels of pressure, and lays down measures aimed at establishing a proportionate response in each phase, allowing for timely mitigation, based on common action, of the challenges faced in addressing the root causes of the pressure at the very beginning, thus preventing escalation of the situation.  The Presidency is trying to strike a balance between responsibility and solidarity. As I have already mentioned in relation to the preparation for the European Council meeting yesterday, the process of seeking consensus is now being led by the President of the European Council. It is up to him and the leaders to look for compromises and propose a way ahead. Any solution that will be found should take account of the interests of all Member States – the frontline Member States and also the Member States that have been destination countries for asylum seekers.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Fifty million people, or 22% of the workforce in Europe, work in regulated professions which are linked to the possession of certain qualifications or in which the holding of a particular title is protected, such as the profession of pharmacist or the profession of architect. For a whole range of professions, for example in the areas of health or safety, special regulation of occupational entry conditions is often justified. However, there are repeated cases at European level in the 28 Member States of the European Union in which excessive, cumbersome and outdated rules make it disproportionately difficult for qualified applicants to access professions. The Member States of the European Union have taken part in the regular legislative procedure to ensure that the principle of proportionality is recognised as a general legal principle in the European Union – not only in primary law, but also in the Professional Recognition Directive. The European Court of Justice has also repeatedly upheld the principle of proportionality in the area of the exercise of professional rights, which may be restricted by the Member States. Currently, Directive 2005/36, last amended in 2013, requires Member States to examine the proportionality of their own requirements restricting access to or exercise of regulated professions and to submit the results of that examination to the Commission. In that regard, Member States may still decide on these rules and provisions themselves, provided that they comply with the principles of primary law and the principle of proportionality. On the basis of this, however, the Commission has established that the exercise of the principle of proportionality by the Member States in recent years has unfortunately not been as successful as the Member States themselves and the Commission had actually promised, and has therefore put forward a new proposal on how the principle of proportionality from the Professional Qualifications Directive can be grasped even more precisely and even better in the future. And even if the European legislator had doubts as to whether the repetition of this principle and the clarification of this principle would really make sense in the end, the many examples presented by the Commission have convinced us. That is why, in the internal market committee, we in the Committee on the Internal Market finally persuaded ourselves by a large majority to work very hard and quickly to draft this legislative proposal. I am grateful to all my fellow Members, especially the shadow rapporteurs, for the fact that a very consensual solution has been reached here. The new directive therefore sets a Europe-wide benchmark for the criteria to be analysed and respected by the authorities of the Member States in the context of the proportionality test, and this will in future clearly regulate what proportionality means in terms of professional regulations and what effects, rules and opportunities will have to be adapted to the principle of proportionality in the future. In my view, the main progress that we have been able to make possible in this report in the end lies in the fact that, on the one hand, we have been able to create clarification for the health professions, but at the same time they must also be subject to the general principle of proportionality, because in the end it is necessary to decide by the courts what the requirements of the principle of proportionality must be. Secondly, it is important to me that this directive should also provide for the provision of cross-border services beyond the Professional Qualifications Recognition Directive only to include proportionate requirements, so that the practice of the profession is not in fact disproportionately restricted in the European internal market. Thirdly, it was clear to us from the outset that this directive does not serve deregulation, but rather a clarification of the principle of proportionality, and that in many places we have not obeyed the somewhat presumed impetus of deregulation, but have ensured that sensible regulation based on the legislation of the Member States will remain as possible in the future as before. Finally, it is important to me that we can also account for the craftsmanship, which in many places is an important achievement for our economy and society, not only by recognising compulsory membership in the Chamber, but also in other places, that we regard master-letter training as a particularly important contribution to the training of young people. And finally, it is, of course, important, including in the context of this legislative project, that subsidiarity, that is to say ensuring the legislative mandate on the basis of the Member States, is maintained and that we have all promised each other that we will not call into question the competence of the Member States at any point, provided they respect the principle of proportionality. I believe that, in the context of the proposal for notification to be discussed at a later date, which then leads the Member States to submit appropriate measures of professional regulation first to the European Commission for consideration, we will be able to improve the exercise framework of regulated professions in the European Union, in the European internal market, through this proposal. That is why I hope that, in the end, all the Member States will also take account of it. Finally, i would like to thank all the Members who have worked on it. I hope that this will enable us to take a small but hopefully effective step towards the European internal market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 279, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Andreas SCHWAB", "mepid": "28223", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I’m really happy to be here today for this debate on the Proportionality Test Directive ahead of tomorrow’s final vote. With this proposal, we have jointly delivered on the first part of our services package of January 2017. I really welcome your cooperation and your support. What do we want to achieve with this directive? You know that negotiations were thorough, they were intense, but we reached an agreement in just over a year, so relatively shortly. Let me briefly recall the goal of the directive. We want to improve the quality of the future regulation of professional services. As your rapporteur said, they are of utmost importance for our economies. Business services, including professional services such as accountants, lawyers, engineers and architects account for almost 13% of EU value added. Regulated professions all together make up nearly 22% of the European labour force, so almost 47 million people. And research shows that services inputs, including professional services, account for about 40% of the value added in manufacturing industries. So it’s extremely important for our economies. We also note that poorly-designed regulation creates obstacles, especially for young graduates trying to access these professions and for professionals when carrying out their professions. So we need to ensure that across the EU, the new regulation is really proportionate in order to protect public interests and that it does not create needless obstacles. This directive will help Member States with devising their regulations. It will mean that we can minimise any negative effects on the single market, on competitiveness or on the mobility of professionals. It does not prevent Member States from adopting new requirements, but it does prevent unjustified ones. We are not losing sight of existing requirements either. We adopted reform recommendations on the existing regulation of professional services as part of the services package. You discussed these recommendations recently – I’m really grateful for that, and I want to thank Mr Danti for a report that really encourages us to pursue this important work together with the Member States, and we are doing exactly that. The Proportionality Test Directive complements this by helping Member State authorities to fulfil their obligations under existing legislation, and of course, court judgments. It sets out very clear rules on how to determine whether planned legislation is really fit for purpose and makes sure that this is determined in advance of legislation being adopted. We have insisted many times that the Commission should make enforcement of existing rules a priority, and we are doing exactly that. But we have to recognise that ex-post enforcement actions are definitely not enough. The new directive will help us provide clarity on the general obligation of the principle of proportionality. As I said, I’m really grateful for the way that we have worked together on this proposal. The compromise, I think, strikes the right balance. The outcome of the negotiations maintains the overall objective of the proposed directive. It maintains legal certainty and coherence, while at the same time making sure that important public interests such as patient safety – which was raised many times – and our human health are really clearly acknowledged. There were many moments where some doubted that this directive should cover all of the professions, but clearly, the principle of proportionality applies to all professions, so I am grateful that this House – you, honourable Members – has managed to find a good compromise. I also welcome the enhanced transparency and additional focus on the principle of non-discrimination. Transparency has to be ensured before and after a new regulation is adopted in the Member States. Relevant stakeholders shall now be involved before Member States adopt the new regulation on professional services. The reason why the regulation was found to be necessary will be available to all after its adoption. You also have drawn attention to the obstacles that may hit professionals when they want to provide temporary or occasional services, so I welcome the addition that proportionality of requirements related specifically to this temporary or occasional provision of services must be assessed. The Qualifications Directive already says that professionals must be able to provide their services in other Member States without unnecessary administrative hurdles. But of course, too often Member States demand plenty of information from professionals instead of just using direct cooperation with other Member States via our well-established internal market information tool, IMI. Let me be clear that this does not affect the posting of workers or the application of local working conditions. I think that the adoption of this directive will not be the end of our work in this field; rather, it is the beginning. We will look closely into the implementation of this directive and will assist Member States. We will place special emphasis on the transparency that you introduced for the regulation and its rationale via our regulated professions database. This database has really become a reference tool for professional regulations in the EU. I would especially like to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs, the competent ministers and, of course, the Presidency for your cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 280, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Pascal ARIMONT", "mepid": "24922", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. More than 5500 professions are currently regulated in the EU. And there are still significant problems with the mutual recognition of professional qualifications between Member States. We continue to receive a great many complaints when, for example, in one Member State, nonsensical conditions are required to carry out its profession in another Member State. That must not be allowed to happen. That is why this proportionality test, as it is now being adopted here via this law, is an important step. It will help to simplify professional recognition across borders. This is particularly important for people who live on a border, as I represent them. Many people rightly do not understand why they should not be allowed to pursue their profession in another country, which they do well and in a qualified manner. Another part of the so-called service package was the so-called electronic service card, and I will come back to it very briefly. I was very clear in my opposition in committee and even contributed to their rejection with my vote. Why was that important? This service card would have re-emerged all the problems that we actually wanted to combat with the Posting of Workers Directive. It would have made effective controls more difficult and provided a new gateway for social dumping. However, we must combat social dumping more effectively, rather than simplifying it. Of course, it remains important for companies to be able to offer their services across borders. This is what our internal market thrives on.

The goal we set ourselves was an ambitious goal. It was a question of changing the text that the Commission had given us in large parts. So finding balance and convergence on new formulations was no small feat, we succeeded and that is very important. Our aim was this and, at the same time, to seek solutions that would not restrict the autonomy of the Member States. It was supposed to be our work of supporting the Member States, maintaining their autonomy in regulating professional activities and in pursuing, through this regulation, objectives of public interest, as has already been said in the debate.  We have now amended that proposal and we are at a conclusion, some aspects of which I would like to highlight. We have ensured that the modalities of the test are flexible and proportionate to the changes under consideration. That wasn't the case at first. We have explicitly stressed the competence of the Member States to regulate the professions. The different approaches are not to be considered as wrong or negative, even before they are proposed, but they must come into synergy with the overall solution that we are evaluating here.  We rejected – yes, because there are not only the positive things that we have added, there are also those that we have deleted – the Commission's proposal to create independent supervisory bodies that could disrupt future work, ensuring that the list of criteria to be assessed is proportionate and less burdensome for the Member States, including through the elimination of the economic impact assessment that was in the initial text. We have strengthened the measures of transparency and consultation of stakeholders, starting with the social partners, and we have finally maintained the explicit recognition in the text of the directive of the specificity of the regulation of the health professions, which has caused so much debate but which has created so much sensitivity in all the countries of the Union.  We therefore have the autonomy of the Member States, which avoids deregulation, and at the same time we have increased the transparency and involvement of the social partners.

Today, those who want to offer professional services or take up a job in another Member State face a significant number of regulatory obstacles. The situation is all the worse in professions where professional qualifications need to be demonstrated, and the 28 Member States have their own rules on what that qualification should look like. Those interested in these professions are then facing a slow and bureaucratic process of so-called mutual recognition of qualifications. For this reason, I consider the proportionality test to be correct, because it aims to prevent excessive professional regulations before they are adopted by the States. Proportionality has long been a well-known and sadly unbalanted principle, otherwise today we would not have states with more than 500 regulated professions, while another state is enough for the 1970s. The proportionality test should discourage unnecessary regulations for states, and the benefit of our negotiations with the Council has also been to maintain the principle of greater transparency in the adoption of national rules. I am pleased that we are trying to remove obstacles and not create them, and this directive is one of the few that really has the potential to reduce the number of regulations. However, the question arises as to why we cannot be consistent in this approach. Today, we are removing barriers, but two weeks ago we voted for a new regulation of the Posting of Workers Directive, which deliberately restricts service providers from other Member States.

One of the fundamental freedoms in the European Union is the freedom to work and to do business. To make this possible, we should consistently remove all barriers to mobility and, above all, administrative barriers. Their existence is evidenced, for example, by the fact that only a small percentage of citizens still work outside their country of origin in the European Union. One of the barriers to mobility, not only between Member States, but also internal mobility, is the over-regulated rules on access to different professions. Very often they are a manifestation of protectionism, which in fact kills healthy competition and inhibits development. Such overregulation of professions, such as legal professions, also has negative effects on consumers, which is reflected in the high prices of legal or notarial services.  The assessment of regulated professions in European countries has shown that often national regulations are not based on sound and objective analysis. For this reason, the introduction of a mandatory proportionality analysis is extremely necessary. From here, I would like to express my deep support for this legislative initiative. The establishment of a common framework, the conduct of a proportionality test or the introduction of new rules governing professions will make greater use of the opportunities in the single market and facilitate access to professions. Unfortunately, this proposal has been criticised by many colleagues, including the Committee on Employment, which is why I would like to dispel a few myths about it. Member States will continue to decide for themselves how to regulate access to professions.

However, data shows that this is not always the case. According to Business Europe, many activities are regulated in only a few Member States and more than 25% of them are regulated in just one Member State.

Intra-European mobility is already made difficult by factors such as language, access to information, bureaucracy and social security provisions.

The Cotonou Agreement with the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific concerns the Union’s cooperation with 78 countries. One in five of the world’s population lives in those countries, and the proportion is set to rise. No other EU partnership agreement has a similar geographic scope. The Cotonou Agreement covers trade, development, cooperation and the political dimension. It provides a detailed list of human rights and democratic principles that the parties must comply with. The agreement expires in February 2020 and negotiation must be launched by August this year. Many stakeholders have been consulted over the past two years and the partnership has been completely evaluated. Also, in the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly we have discussed the future of the cooperation beyond 2020. Also, our Parliament contributed to the reflection by a resolution prepared by my colleague Norbert Neuser, which was adopted in October 2016. This resolution stressed that the next agreement should maintain the acquis of the Cotonou Agreement, notably the legally-binding nature of the agreement, the political dialogue and the essential elements of respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance. Ahead of the adoption of the mandate, our Committee on Development thought it would be useful to present the EP priorities for the upcoming negotiations, taking into account the fact that Parliament needs to give its consent to the final agreement and that it should also be fully and regularly informed about the negotiations whilst they are ongoing. We understand that agreeing on the mandate within the Council is taking longer than expected and is proving difficult.

The question of the balance between the three regional components is also important in view of the enhanced partnership with Africa. Political dialogue is a fundamental part of the Cotonou Agreement and must remain a central and legal pillar of the overarching framework and at regional level. We believe that the effectiveness of the political dialogue should be improved, notably through better monitoring of the human rights situation in the partner countries. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular Sustainable Development Goal (STG) 17, stresses the need for true multi-stakeholder partnerships. There is a need for a reinforced role for parliaments, civil society and regional and local authorities, starting right from the phase of negotiating the new agreement. The new partnership is perceived as one going beyond aid, and going further than a recipient-donor relationship. This is very welcome. We insist on the need to put the 2030 Agenda, the SDGs and the European Consensus on Development at the heart of the future ACP-EU partnership. The eradication of poverty should remain a central element of this future agreement, and we should live up to the 2030 Agenda commitment ‘to leave no one behind’. With this debate, we would like to receive more information on the future institutional design and the future interplay between the Joint Council and the Joint Parliamentary Assembly (JPA). Let me take the opportunity to repeat the importance of strengthening the parliamentary dimension of the future agreement, guaranteeing real consultative power for the future overarching JPA and ensuring that it provides for open, democratic and comprehensive parliamentary dialogue. The ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly is an innovative institution, and we should take the opportunity of the future agreement to consolidate its legitimacy. The European Parliament believes that the Assembly should be closely associated with the implementation of the agreement and that it should be regularly consulted on all matters of importance for the partnership. Last but not least, the ACP side has decided to widely disseminate the negotiating mandate of the ACP Group of States. Can the Presidency promise that the Council will publish the negotiating directives? Also, will the Commission publish textual proposals during the negotiations? I look forward to your answers, and thank you very much for your attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 308, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I am grateful for the question, which gives us the opportunity to discuss this very important topic. ACP-EU relations after 2020 have been high on the agenda of all the Presidencies in the past four years and the Bulgarian Presidency has had the privilege of taking the lead at this crucial moment. The Cotonou Agreement set a clear deadline for the start of the negotiations between the two parties and the Presidency spared no efforts to finalise the EU preparation process so that negotiations can open before the summer break. Our relations with the ACP countries are at an important juncture. We have all witnessed the significant changes since the signing of the Cotonou Agreement. The world, the European Union and the ACP themselves are no longer the same. Our own reality has become much more complex. The European Union has 13 Member States more than in 2000 and the ACP countries have also developed in various ways. Cooperation and interdependence at global level have gained even more importance in recent years, and relying on alliances is a key element of the European Union vision of multilateral values and principles on the international stage. The Council took the upcoming negotiations with the ACP as a clear opportunity to strive for a new framework that responds most effectively to these new challenges. I am happy to note that the European Parliament has shared this approach since the beginning. There was also a convergence of views from early on with the ACP side that the new framework needs to be adapted to the new reality so that we can address global challenges more efficiently. The 2030 sustainable development agenda will be the backbone of the new ACP-EU relationship. The EU position is therefore embedded in the European Consensus on Development and the new EU global strategy. The Council is in the very final stage of an extremely intense discussion process to agree the negotiating mandate. Its slant is commensurate with the importance we give to our future relations with the ACP states. With only one outstanding issue, by far the major part of the negotiating mandate is agreed. The Presidency is confident that the last outstanding issue can be resolved in the coming days so that the negotiations with the ACP side can be opened shortly. The vision of the European Union Member States is clear. We want to bring about a major change. Our aim is to leave behind the limitations of the donor-recipient relationship for good, and to open a new chapter with a bond between equal partners. Development, while an important part of our relations, should become one of the many areas of the complex, more political architecture. The ACP group has great aspirations and we are convinced that the two parties together can become a driving force on important global issues. Let me give you an example: in the area of climate change, our joint efforts have been exceptionally fruitful. The ACP-EU Council of Ministers adopted the ACP-EU Joint Declaration on Climate Change on 1 June, ahead of the upcoming conference in December. With Poland taking over the chairmanship of the Pre-COP from Fiji, this allows us to maintain joint ACP-EU efforts over two terms of office and to steer our common agenda further ahead. This successful example needs to be replicated in other areas of global importance. On the EU side, we are convinced that we can do it, and are putting all our energy into achieving this. The ACP-EU architecture is very complex and the different levels need to be readjusted to our new reality. The situation on the ground differs between the regions and countries, and regional and local players are gaining more and more importance. The EU intends to respond to this by shifting the centre of gravity and proposing tailor-made, action-orientated regional partnerships. We need to act at the most appropriate level, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, and to enhance the efficiency of the ACP-EU partnership. Our ambition is to agree on a more political framework with the ACP side. The new framework is intended to encompass all relevant matters of joint interest, such as human rights, fundamental freedoms, democracy, the rule of law and good governance, human development, sustainable and inclusive growth, peace, security and justice, as well as mobility and migration. It includes a strong commitment to the principle of leaving no one behind, which is not at all in contradiction with the objective of a modernised political partnership that goes beyond the traditional development-aid approach. It’s quite the opposite. Only a comprehensive political partnership will put us in a position to build peaceful, well-governed and prosperous states and societies by accelerating progress towards the attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals and thus to eradicate poverty and tackle discrimination and inequality.

I welcome your resolution and the question on the upcoming negotiations of the partnership agreement between the European Union and the countries of the African, Caribbean and Pacific group of states. Your position on the way forward and that of the Commission are broadly aligned. We share the conviction that we need a legally binding agreement that is based on the essential elements of our existing partnership, namely respect for human rights, democratic principles, the rule of law and good governance. They are all part of the acquis and must be strengthened in the new agreement. I also agree with your call to preserve a strong ACP identity. Together, the European Union and ACP countries represent more than half of the UN membership. Such an alliance should be further exploited. Keeping the framework with 79 countries is fully compatible with having a tailored and strengthened approach to cooperation with the main regions. Africa will remain very much in focus in the years to come. The future EU-Africa pillar should build on the existing joint Africa-European strategy and use its institutional set-up. At the same time, the importance of our Caribbean and Pacific partners will also be confirmed. The institutional and political architecture of the new EU-ACP partnership agreement will be key to this. Each region should have a distinct governance and a focus on regionally relevant priorities for dialogue and cooperation. Political dialogue must be an integral part of the new partnership at all levels, including the ACP-wide level, the continental, regional and national levels, through the format most appropriate to the issues discussed. I also agree with your insistence that a core principle of the new partnership agreement should be a multi-stakeholder approach to dialogue and cooperation. Let me also reassure you that the new partnership will fully confirm the commitment to implement the UN 2030 agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals. Eradicating poverty and leaving no one behind will remain core aspects of our relationship with the ACP countries, which will cover all topics on which there are mutual interests. I also agree with you that the role of parliaments should be reinforced. Regional parliaments, in particular, should be stronger, matching the increased prominence of EU-Africa, EU-Caribbean and EU-Pacific regional councils in the future ACP-EU agreement. As regards the rhythm of meetings, the Commission has proposed that the ACP-EU Council should be convened on an ad hoc basis. The Joint Parliamentary Assembly should work closely with the ACP Council of Ministers, according to those same principles. Lastly, concerning publication of the negotiating directives, the Commission has suggested that the Council publish the final EU negotiating directive. It is ultimately up to Council itself to decide what it considers the most appropriate course to follow. Our counterparts in the ACP group adopted their negotiating mandate a few days ago at the ACP Ministerial Council in Lomé. Now it’s up to the Council of the European Union to adopt ours.

Madam President, Commissioner, since time is running out, I would like to say essentially three things. First of all, if there is a reason to maintain the EU/ACP framework that we are currently experiencing, it would be for strategic reasons, because between the two blocs, if I dare say so, we represent a majority of The Member States of the United Nations, and I find that at present and in view of the other factors involved, particularly in the countries benefiting from development cooperation, it might be worth reminding those countries which are our partners that the attitude towards Europe would logically be a privileged attitude. Secondly, I would like us not to get totally lost in the frills. The involvement of civil society and all that is fine, but at the end of the day, what is important is that, particularly in the African part of the partnership, we are in the presence of stable, functioning states with which a partnership for development makes sense. I cannot develop anything, for example, in the Central African Republic until the state exists, and it is not civil society alone that will help me; unfortunately, I would need troops, troops that we refused, weapons that we refused to the Central African government. Finally, as far as Africa is concerned, there is a dichotomy that we will have to resolve. The Pan-African Parliament covers the entire continent and we will need to determine how to integrate our special relationship with Africa into the overall relationship with the ACP region. The north of Africa is not necessarily a problem, but a hitherto absent element and must be somehow integrated, which leads me to believe that the focus in the future will have to be on a strategic relationship with the whole of Africa in any case.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 311, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Enrique GUERRERO SALOM", "mepid": "96768", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Madam President, Commissioner, since the cotonou Agreement was adopted in 2000, and even since its revisions in 2005 and 2010, the world has changed quite a bit. New players have appeared in a certain global mess and I am sure that now, in reviewing our next stage, we must take into account three fundamental objectives. First, strengthen political dialogue. Many of the actors in the ACP group are now relevant in the multipolar world, and the European Union shares strategic objectives in this world management with them. Second, contributing to the economic development of many of these countries, most of which are in poverty and in need of investment, need the capacity to provide opportunities for their citizens.  Third, cooperate with them to meet sustainable development goals. Together we are more than half of the United Nations and together we can move forward, reducing poverty and, if we do, we will have made great progress in the whole world. Of course, we call for a greater presence of parliamentary scrtrolling in the implementation of the new Cotonou Agreement; we want to maintain the structure of the GPA, but at the same time highlight regional integration within its field; we want to increase accountability and there are two fundamental points I want to refer to.

Both the EU and the ACP countries should benefit from this exchange of experience between them. The negotiating mandate for the future agreement between the EU and the ACP countries was adopted two weeks ago in Togo. In this context, the fundamental principles of the Cotton Partnership Agreement must be maintained and form part of our future treaty.  Supporting and promoting human rights and democratic principles, developing policies to build peace and enhance security in vulnerable areas, promote democracy, tackle migration and climate change, combat terrorism and, finally, address food insecurity are fundamental issues that need to be addressed. Political dialogue must remain a central pillar in the overall context of the new agreement, while the principles of effective development cooperation must be fully integrated into the new ACP-EU Partnership Agreement. Finally, on a practical level, I firmly believe that the EU must play a central role in educating and cultivating skills for the peoples of the ACP countries, while supporting them to stay in and work for their countries.

Madam President, Commissioner, Cotonou has had the immense merit of combining development aid, trade and the political character of our relations. These elements of the spirit of this historic agreement must, of course, not only be preserved, but from my point of view, ambitiously amplified in a legally binding agreement. We have no right to miss this unique opportunity that should allow us to finally be genuine political partners. Partners whose destinies would be irretrievably and for the better linked economically, environmentally, industrially, ethically and politically. I am thinking of real gender equality policies, a human and legal migration policy, the consolidation of regal states whose authority and legitimacy could no longer be arbitrarily questioned. So Commissioner, I can of course understand the proposal for a pillar structure headed by a coordination dome. Basically, it is a little bit like continuing what exists today. But I cannot help but see the risk of maintaining our relations with Africa, especially in too narrow a straitjacket. We could very well ensure that the Pacific and the Caribbean are integrated into their natural geographical, cultural and historical reality. I am one of those who believe that the creation of a vast free trade area covering both continents and in accordance with the current bilateral association agreements would be an effective response to the uncertainties that disfigure the morale of Africans and Europeans. The resulting prosperity, Commissioner, would offer African and European youth an unprecedented prospect of economic and democratic development. In my view, this would be the real and only solution to the difficulties we have in managing migration phenomena. I see no better way to support the immigration pact initiated by UN Secretary-General Antonio Gutierrez. Beyond that, I totally agree with Mr Engel's argument that such an alliance would, of course, offer the world a much greater positive influence.

We must promote small industry and family farming, which feeds the world, and we must not condition our aid on our own interests.

There has been total failure on trade policy. Some EU countries have set up neo-colonialist agreements, in which only sustainable measures on human rights, new social standards and environmental protection were put into words, but in fact trade liberalisation has been fuelled by imposing our products, such as new medicines, such as processed products or advanced technology products such as mobile phones, at great cost. While this was happening, these countries, particularly France, raided raw materials, from rare materials in congo to fishery products in Senegal, fuels in Nigeria, uranium in Niger, blood diamonds in Serra Leone and cocoa in Côte d'Ivoire. Political cooperation should have been one of the cornerstones of the Cotonou Agreement, but until now it has not led even remotely to the stability that we were all looking for. On the contrary, it seems to us that insecurity is being nurtured and even encouraged in such a way as to finance the business of arms sales and also that of migrants. In the negotiations, it must be stressed that political dialogue is a fundamental aspect of the Cotonou Agreement and that it must remain a central pillar in the general legal framework. If we want to do only trade policies without thinking about the situation of rights and without significant involvement of civil society in dialogue at all levels, the new agreement will also fail like the previous one. As far as cooperation and development are concerned, I am not afraid to say that they are in fact limited to the intergovernmental dimension alone, which is beyond the control of parliaments and civil society. The meetings of the ACP-EU joint institutions, and in particular of the Joint Council of Ministers, have produced very little concrete results and experienced unfortunately minimal and low-level participation. Development cooperation should have had the primary objective of erasing poverty. Unfortunately, none of this has happened.

Firstly, we are calling for a genuine multi-actor partnership in the future, but this time we are not referring to the different religious communities, even though without them there is clearly no social stability and fight against poverty in most ACP countries. Think specifically of the great mediation role of the Catholic Episcopal Conference in Congo, which is helping to create one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. I would also like to send a message to the Council and the Commission: in the new agreement, we cannot leave churches out of the structure of EU-ACP cooperation. Secondly, the human rights situation needs to be improved. Yes, that's right, I can only agree. We must have zero tolerance for systems that trample on individual or collective freedom. In the future, it is out of the question to make business dealings with such regimes. Finally, I would like to argue with point 19 of the EP decision, which is very problematic for me. The ideological approach to migration, the planned immigration, simply deceiving people, instead of the absolute primacy of helping people in trouble locally, they send false messages. They are deceived by the promise of inclusion, employment opportunities, integration. It is a slap in the face to the extreme confusion between the situation of refugees and migrants. Why?

The European Union must seize the opportunity offered to it in these negotiations on a new partnership agreement after Cotonou and put development assistance as a major instrument of public diplomacy.  The development assistance provided by the European Union must have greater visibility and serve as a tool for a more effective foreign policy.

Almost twenty years of operation of the Agreement, about forty years of operation of the ACP Group, and what achievements do we have there? Room? No , these are very often places of bloody wars. Democracy? It would rarely be possible to sign the thesis that it reigns there. Human rights? They are often only on paper. Economic development? It is difficult to comment on this at all.  I may stress this too emphaticly, but it is precisely to make all those involved in this agreement aware that the mistakes of these almost twenty years cannot be duplicated. A new contract cannot be implemented in the same philosophy. In my opinion, one of the reasons for the failure of our policy towards the ACP countries is that it was, as some have argued here, based on the objective of aid. So as only aid is used, it is very often – I do not want to say only, but very often – only funds, capital, and therefore not only money, but also energy, time, etc. are squandered. In my opinion, the new agreement should be created on the basis of building partnerships to achieve certain objectives, it should not just be aid. Please note that, after all, the actions of the United States or, more recently, China are more effective, although in a shorter period of time.

Many Roma still face deep poverty, social exclusion and racial discrimination. We have a common duty to ensure decent life chances for all our citizens and we must pay special heed to those who find themselves in the most vulnerable situations.  This is a topic that goes to the heart of our common European values. Equal treatment and equal opportunities should be enjoyed by all of us. Sadly, in Europe, in the 21st century, this is not yet the case. It has already been seven years since the Council, the Commission and Parliament joined their voices to call for action to improve the situation of the Roma. Back in 2011, we launched the EU Framework for National Roma Integration Strategies. Parliament and the Commission took the first steps and I’m glad to recall that the Council swiftly endorsed the framework and the European Council called for its rapid implementation. The Member States duly prepared their national strategies and began putting the framework into practice.  I’m also happy to note that, in its mid-term report published last year, the Commission was able to confirm the added value of the framework. It is particularly encouraging to read that the participation of Roma children in early childhood education is on the rise and that poverty is falling. There are definite signs that the implementation of the framework is bearing fruit.  But let us be honest, we have not yet managed to end the discrimination, the deep poverty and the long-term disadvantages that have weighed on Roma communities. There is no room for complacency. If anything, we must redouble the efforts to put things right and to offer the same life chances to all citizens, regardless of their ethnic origin.  This is why the Bulgarian Presidency has put an important emphasis on issues at the heart of advancing the agenda in this area. The Council is expected to adopt a set of conclusions on the early childhood development later this month. The focus has been put on promoting and protecting children’s rights, combating child poverty and social exclusion and providing all children with equal opportunities, irrespective of their social, cultural, ethnic or other backgrounds.  Member States should continue to provide multi-disciplinary support to children and families from disadvantaged backgrounds, such as Roma children. Investing in early childhood education and care is of high importance, not only for reducing inequalities at a young age, but also for preventing the risk of poverty and exclusion in adulthood by laying the foundations for successful lifelong learning, social integration and employability.  The European Parliament has worked tirelessly to keep this topic on the agenda. In matters where our common values are clearly spelt out in the Treaty yet Union competences are limited, strong political voices are needed to motivate us and to move us forward, so I thank you for helping us to keep the momentum.  The framework focuses on four main areas: education, housing, health and jobs. These are the matters we must address. No one in Europe should be denied the basic prerequisites for a decent life. The Council has also made the point that racial discrimination is unacceptable because it is also a root cause of the social exclusion of the Roma.  May I also highlight just three other key issues. The Council has repeatedly stressed the importance of the gender dimension in this context and the need for gender-sensitive approaches. The Council also strongly believes that the Roma themselves should be allowed to participate in planning and implementing policies that concern them. Finally, we need an emphasis on the local level. It is the people on the ground who can make the greatest differences.  None of this is controversial. I believe there is a broad agreement between our institutions on the approach we should take. The tools and the strategic insights are already here. A strong and sustained political commitment is needed, along with more forceful implementation. The EU institutions have been playing a leading role in the campaign for Roma inclusion for some years now. This is most welcome. It’s making a difference. Cooperation and funding at EU level can contribute significantly.  The framework we established in 2011 is due to expire in 2020. It is painful to admit that ten years have not been enough to significantly improve the situation of Europe’s Roma. To make greater strides, we need both a sense of urgency and a long-term vision. For this reason, in 2016, the Council called on the Commission to propose a post-2020 strategy on Roma integration and the Council stands ready to work further on these vital subjects. I know Parliament will be a faithful ally in this process.

We will publish the evaluation by the end of this year. It will analyse the achievements and challenges of the framework. These could then be the basis for reflections about possible policy suggestions for the post-2020 period. Without prejudging the outcome of this process, it is already clear that we have not undone centuries of discrimination in the few years since the launch of the framework in 2011. However, we can see the first signs of progress in some areas, like education. Fewer Roma youths leave school early, dropping from 87% in 2011 to 68% in 2016. More Roma children participate in early childhood education, rising from 47% in 2011 to 53% in 2016. Another important achievement is the development of necessary coordination and cooperation structures, such as national Roma contact points in all Member States and the annual European platform for Roma inclusion. The most important overarching challenge is the limited impact on improving the present situation of Roma. In several areas, there is still much to do. Less, although still way too many Roma are at risk of poverty: 86% in 2011 and 80% in 2016. Extreme forms of poverty such as hunger decreased slightly, but remain alarmingly high. Less, but still too many Roma have experienced discrimination when looking for work in the past five years. In some aspects, the situation of Roma even worsened in past years. Segregation in education has persisted and even deteriorated. The Roma employment stagnates at low levels – 25% – and the rate of Roma youths not in education or in employment or training grew from 56% to 63%. The housing situation of the Roma remains deplorable. Sadly, strong external factors such as the economic crisis, competing political priorities and the rise of anti-Gypsyism and nationalistic populist political movements have contributed to limit the progress. However, the Commission will strive to make the situation of Roma in Europe better, in concert with the Member States, which maintain the key competences in this area.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 346, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, I would like to thank the European The current Roma strategy in Europe may not have delivered on its expectations. The main reason for this is that a very strong document has passed through the European Parliament, while the Commission has not been fully committed to taking forward to the Council the very important points without which this strategy cannot be successful: targets, legal basis, penalty opportunities, and the main problem is that, in fact, the Roma are not able to participate in these programmes. , neither in their design nor in their construction. That's why they're so inefficient. I feel that there is a great lack of financial control, financial control, because we are facing a much more complex situation than in 2011. Roma employment is still below the majority national average, while we see that 30 million people will be missing in the labour market by 2060. It is an impermissible luxury for Europe to leave europe's poor untapped. Active job creation is perhaps the most important thing right now. We have achieved a lot of results, and I thank Mrs Panayotova for reporting on it in such detail. I agree, both in early child development and on other issues. Thank you for the Commission's attitude, but we still need to move on. One of the big problems, I see, is that the lying news about the Roma or the Roma policy of the Member States is increasingly ingenable in the parliamentary material itself.

Due to this, the Member States now have their national strategies and there are programmes and funds aimed at fighting anti-Gypsyism in its various forms. Although we are far from seeing the much-needed improvement in the lives of Roma in Europe, there has been some progress. Now we need to up-scale the efforts following the clear and strong position of the European Parliament. This position was based on the concrete demands and proposals in the report entitled ‘Fundamental rights aspects in Roma integration in the EU: fighting anti-Gypsyism’ adopted by a threefold majority last year. In addition to addressing social inclusion, we need to situate anti-Gypsyism in the focus of the post-2020 EU framework and to introduce anti-discrimination indicators in all fields. We need to set specific deadlines for measurable goals. There should be consultations with Roma representatives to avoid the creation of discriminatory programmes, or programmes that do not reach out to the Roma. We need close monitoring in order to identify quickly which actions can improve the situation on the ground and which do not. I therefore ask the Commission and the upcoming Presidencies to keep the fight against anti-Gypsyism on their agenda and support the continuation of the EU framework. The 10 million Roma in Europe must be equally entitled to enjoy the rights and opportunities established by our Treaties. Their situation depends on the continuation of the framework.

Persecuted for centuries, Roma citizens continue to be victims of prejudice and discrimination in Europe today in education, employment, access to housing and social benefits, thus making them especially vulnerable to poverty, social exclusion and trafficking in human beings. They are also often victims of forced evictions, racist attacks and police mistreatment and, in some Member States, prevented from obtaining the citizenship and documents necessary for health and social security services. This shows that, despite some improvements in the field of education, Member States are lacking in their fight against discrimination and makes it urgent to ensure that the Union framework for national roma integration strategies in the post-2020 period is more ambitious and more integrated, in a logic of empowerment and fostering the participation of roma communities themselves - i close , Mr President - so that they finally cease to exist in the Union romai stateless or treated as second-rate citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 368, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Sirpa PIETIKÄINEN", "mepid": "40599", "text": "   – Mr President, with this strategy, the position of the Roma has not improved much in the Member States.

In my Committee, we have received a number of petitions asking to improve language learning and the mutual recognition of language competences in the European Union. The petitioners claim that the existing differences in the teaching, evaluation and recognition of language skills in different Member States undermine the freedom of movement, which is very serious. They also claim that it discriminates against children in school whose mother tongue is one of the smaller languages of the 24 official languages of the European Union. My Committee decided therefore to table this oral question to both the Council and the Commission on this issue, and both these questions were unanimously – and I underline, unanimously – adopted by the Committee on Petitions. According to Article 165 of the Treaty, Member States are exclusively competent for the content and the organisation of education and training systems. So in this sense, the offer of languages for secondary school exams is the decision of the Member State’s Ministry of Education on the organisation of their educational system. However, proficiency in very much more than only one language is considered essential to strengthen employability within the European Union. It is also a critical key competence for active citizenship. The EU therefore supports and supplements the actions of the Member States, with the aim to improve the efficiency of language teaching and learning. The oral questions to the institutions therefore tabled by my Committee are in line with the Commission’s initiative on the creation of the European education agenda. I’m proud of that. We are completely (inaudible) within that scope, and in particular the concerned package of measures presented by the Commission in May this year suggesting, among other things, a Council recommendation for improving language learning. The Committee on Petitions wanted to have a debate on these oral questions in this plenary, taking into account the adoption by plenary of the own initiative report by the Cultural Committee on modernisation of education in the European Union. The EU has long promoted language learning with an aim to increase mutual understanding and mobility, this by supporting supplementing actions and cooperation between national educational systems. Parliament is taking serious note of these petitions that we have received, in which EU citizens do raise their severe concerns about the lack of teaching and recognition of language skills in their mother tongue. Every EU citizen should be able to take advantage of their freedom to live in a Member State other than his or her own, and unfortunately this problem is today making it difficult to do so. Therefore, we ask and call upon the Council and the Commission to elaborate on the following issues – and I have them, there are four: Firstly, what actions have you taken to support Member States in order to improve the mutual recognition of language competences in all the official EU languages, based on the levels existing under the common European framework of reference for languages? Secondly, how does the Council and the Commission assess the added value of teaching official EU languages and particularly the recommendation for ‘mother tongue plus two’ in the context of modernisation of education in the EU, and more particularly for stimulating entrepreneurship, job opportunities and preservation of cultural diversities within the European Union? Thirdly, does the Council and the Commission have recent and accurate data available concerning language assessment opportunities and the recognition of language exams, diplomas or certificates in the official EU languages other than English, French, German, Spanish and Italian – the big five? How can the European Union further support educational institutions that do provide classes in the official EU languages for EU citizens living in a Member State other than their own? And lastly, what measures does the Council and the Commission intend to put in place in the European education area to develop an online system for the cross-border recognition and validation of EU language certificates for the purposes of school-leaving diplomas in order to facilitate accessibility to higher education across the EU? Those are our four questions. They conclude my Committee’s oral question to the two institutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 376, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, at the Gothenburg summit in November 2017 the EU Heads of State and Government chose education and culture as the first subject to be addressed under the new Leaders’ Agenda, underlining their willingness to do more in these areas. The results of the Gothenburg discussions were formalised in the conclusions of the European Council meeting on 14 December last year, which emphasised that education and culture are key to building inclusive and cohesive societies. But the European Council didn’t limit itself to such general statements: it also set out a number of specific areas for work to be taken forward. I would like to mention two such areas, which are specifically relevant to the question posed today. The first is language learning, where the Heads of State and Government called for action so that more young people will speak at least two European languages in addition to their mother tongue. The second area is the mutual recognition of higher education and school leaving diplomas, and here Member States’ cooperation is key. The benefits of multilingual competences impact upon all aspects of life. They contribute to mutual understanding and mobility within the Union. They increase our productivity, competitiveness and economic resilience. The lack of multilingual competences hampers the mobility of our citizens within the European Union and beyond and limits access to education, training and the labour market. At a time when Europe is looking to the future and seeking to re—engage, especially with young people, around an agenda of shared values, we believe multilingual and multicultural competences are crucial to creating a sense of belonging among Europeans.  Here, I would like to remind you that multilingualism was one of the core elements of the modernised Key Competence Framework adopted by the Council in May and the Council recommendation on promoting common values. The Council recommendation on key competences for lifelong learning is particularly relevant because multilingual competence is identified as one of the eight key competences which should be developed by the Member States’ education systems. This update was not just a single act by the Council to address the common challenge in the European Union of the modernisation of educational institutions, but also part of the Member States’ overall ambition to keep working on the New Skills Agenda for Europe. The Council’s recent extensive work on that matter, including the provision of a quality framework for language learning and recognition, started with the revision of the European Qualifications Framework. The revised European Qualifications Framework recommendation provided better understanding of qualifications and enabled better use of the skills available on the European labour market. The new Europass Framework, agreed recently, builds on the successful formula with easy—to—use tools to help people identify and communicate their skills and qualifications in all EU languages, which is a major boost for the recognition of all EU languages. In addition, many other initiatives in Europe have supported the definition and development of language competences. The Council supports in a sustainable manner the use of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages and recognises the impact of the European Language Label Award for excellence and innovation in language teaching. Allow me to remind you that the Council held an education ministerial debate in February this year, when it called for a stronger Erasmus+ programme building on current successful instruments and further boosting participation. The call for an inclusive Erasmus+ programme, providing more and new participants with mobility opportunities, will increase the opportunities for young people both to learn more languages and to promote their own mother tongue with the European Union and beyond. In May the Council adopted important strategic conclusions on moving towards the vision a European Education Area, which recognised multilingual competence as an important building block of such an area. In the meantime, the Commission has issued a package of three further proposals for Council recommendations, including a proposal on the mutual recognition of higher education and school leaving diplomas and the proposal on improving language learning. The two proposed recommendations are particularly relevant to today’s discussion. The recommendation on improving language learning focuses on language teaching and learning in compulsory education, covering both general and vocational schools, as well as multilingual competences in a lifelong perspective. Both recommendations will be examined in detail by the Council. This process has only just begun and it is therefore too early at this point to comment on the substance. However, there is already broad consensus that these are the key areas to be addressed in seeking to build a European education area and it is my understanding that the ambition of the forthcoming Austrian Presidency is to seek agreement at least on the first proposal, on mutual recognition of diplomas, before the end of this year. Therefore, on the issue of language learning, as well as mutual recognition of diplomas, it is clear that the work is progressing quite quickly. These issues are a priority for the Council, and Parliament can expect quality results during the upcoming Presidencies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 377, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   I would like to thank the Minister and welcome Commissioner Navracsics, who will be remembering this evening because today is her birthday, and I wish him a happy birthday.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 378, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, thank you for this oral question which reflects Parliament’s strong commitment to multilingualism. Just three weeks ago, the Commission adopted a proposal for a Council recommendation on the teaching and learning of languages. In fact, this proposal’s recommendation is a response to the European Council which last December called on us, I quote, ‘to enhance the learning of languages so that more young people will speak at least two European languages in addition to their mother tongue’. Language learning and multilingualism have never been higher on the political agenda. We should use this momentum. Let me now answer your questions. First, the mutual recognition of language competence is based on the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages. The Commission supports and encourages Member States to use this Council of Europe framework. It facilitates the assessment of language competences and helps to create mutual understanding and transparency for the recognition of such competences. In recent years, the Commission has reinforced its cooperation with the Council of Europe and its European Centre for Modern Languages, situated in Graz, Austria. We have supported several joint projects, including on the assessment of language competences. Two practical tools have also been developed. First, the European language Portfolio, a document that helps language learners, at and beyond school, to record and reflect on their language learning and cultural experiences. The second instrument is the Europass Language Passport, which is part of the Europass online tool. These two instruments help validate language competences in a transparent and comparable manner. Countries can use them to move towards the recognition of different language competences. On your second question, on teaching languages in the context of the modernisation of education in the EU: language competences are at the heart of our ambitious vision to create a European Education Area. Being able to speak foreign languages is a key condition for studying and working abroad. It provides valuable and much-demanded skills on the labour market, strengthens a sense of European identity and enable learners fully to discover Europe’s cultural diversity. The Commission proposal for a Council recommendation on a comprehensive approach to the teaching and learning of languages stresses that young people need to be able to express themselves in three languages. First is the language of schooling, which is generally the national language; second is a language of international communication; and also a third language, which is most often relevant to their personal context. It is a priority for the Commission to support Member States in making language teaching and learning more effective. Now, on your third question on language assessment and the recognition of language certificates, as well as support to educational institutions: in the 2014 Council conclusions on multilingualism the Commission was invited to explore the feasibility of assessing language competences across all Member States by using existing national language tests. In 2015, two studies were launched. The aim was to map national tests and compare the tests used across Europe to assess the language competences of secondary school pupils. However, these studies concluded that the data available at national level were not comparable. The Erasmus+ programme supports language learning. In fact, this is one of its specific objectives. Opportunities for pupils to learn abroad, which we intend to boost in the future Erasmus programme, will also support the learning of languages. Moreover, teachers will benefit from continuous professional development and mobility schemes. We want to ensure that by 2025 every newly graduated language teacher will have spent at least six months learning or teaching abroad. Online training projects are also valuable for developing language competences. Finally, to your fourth question on the recognition of language competencies in school-leaving diplomas: in May the Commission proposed the Council recommendation on a comprehensive approach to the teaching and learning of languages. It stresses the importance of acquiring and developing adequate language competences in one’s mother tongue plus two additional languages. To help people reach adequate competence levels, the recommendation promotes the concept of language-aware schools that embed language learning – the learning of both of foreign languages and the language of schooling – across curricula. This enables a focus on pupils’ respective needs, circumstances, abilities and interests. Language-aware schools value linguistic diversity and enable students to maintain their entire linguistic repertoire, including their home language or mother tongue when this is not the language of schooling. As a consequence, the prior learning and knowledge of languages which are not part of the curriculum can be formally recognised and can be added to school-leaving certificates. Currently it is not possible to acquire recognised qualifications in all European languages. Therefore, the Commission encourages Member States to step up their efforts to make language certificates more widely available.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 379, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Svetoslav Hristov MALINOV", "mepid": "111027", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – I would like to see today's debate as a wonderful victory for the cause of the small official languages.

This debate, started by the Committee on Petitions, shows that when you have a cause, when you have arguments, your voice will be heard by the European Parliament, and as evidenced by Commissioner Evracsics' response, it will be heard even by the European Commission.

I know that the European Commission in such cases says: \"The question is within the competence of the Member States.\" Specific language policies are implemented in the Member States. In this case, however, it is not just about education, it is about mobility. For mobility and free movement of our most valuable capital – knowledge. Indeed, what more valuable capital does it have than the skills and knowledge of adolescent generations? Language competence is part of that capital. Its acquisition is promoted as a key competence.  It turns out that mobility can devalue and lose language competence already. I'm setting an example for you. A student from Bulgaria with two foreign languages, English and French, arrives in France and remains with only one foreign language. His Bulgarian no longer counts, does not fit anywhere, is not recognized, is not appreciated. This devaluation leads to its non-maintenance and loss. The local system actually says, \"This language is superfluous to you.\" Don't they need Member States with this rare knowledge to make it more closely integrating markets and cultures? We are not talking about harmonisation here, we are not talking about education systems, we are not talking about exam systems, we are not talking about language policies. A mechanism is needed to convey the value of the language knowledge acquired, regardless of which language, how and where they were acquired. It is not harmonisation, but a mechanism of choice of countries – whether with national examinations, whether with recognition of certificates or otherwise. Such a mechanism will appear as an administrative measure, not an educational one. In conclusion, I would say that the issue is not just in front of Bulgarian students and parents, but in front of hundreds of thousands of European citizens.

This is why it is important to receive strong EU support for as many initiatives as possible to strengthen linguistic diversity. The European Union can help learners a lot, for example by adopting language exams and certificates from other Member States more quickly and flexibly, or by better supporting institutions specialising in teaching other languages in other Member States.

I think it is in the EU's interest for people to come to an agreement with each other. To do this, they undoubtedly need a lingua franca, that is English today, and if they are well-off, they will certainly be able to master another foreign language. The EU must also promote mother tongue education. Of course, it is in the interest of the Member States to be active, to promote the linguistic literacy of their citizens, but, given mobility, it is also up to the EU to help them coordinate language education, which is why we are proposing a mechanism for regular transparent evaluation of language competences across Member States. The EU should support educational institutions that provide teaching in official EU languages for citizens living outside their own Member State.

As Vice-President of the European Parliament's Committee on Culture and Education, I think it is very important to talk about languages, language learning and the recognition of languages and diplomas at European Union level. Language is the basis of the child's cognitive and social development, so learning in the mother tongue is important in the first right. In addition, the competence of multilingualism has advantages in all areas of life. Minority and majority languages and cultures alike contribute to Europe's diversity, and there is a consensus on this. The protection of minorities contributes to europe's ethnic, cultural and linguistic diversity. In democratic societies, the teaching of the mother tongue and the learning in the mother tongue are the fundamental rights of all people, including indigenous national minorities. This right must be granted by the State. All the more so that the mother tongue is the best tool for education, since students are best able to meet school requirements in their own language. Unfortunately, minority and regional languages have not received sufficient attention in the recent proposal on an approach to language teaching and language learning published by the European Commission. In line with the principle of subsidiarity, I call on the European Commission and the Council to come up with proposals for the mutual recognition of language examinations and diplomas, thereby supporting not only the spread of major European languages, but also languages spoken by smaller, regional or indigenous minorities in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 402, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Krystyna ŁYBACKA", "mepid": "124883", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. – In the context of the debate on improving language teaching and mutual recognition of language competences in the European Union, I stress the importance of language skills for increased mobility in the EU.

It is a very timely debate, given the developments in relevant international forums, in particular the CITES Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, and also in some of the EU Member States and, of course, at EU level. A number of measures have been taken since we learned about the latest increase in elephant poaching in several African countries. We have seen some encouraging signs since then, but many elephant populations are still at risk. The greatest danger certainly comes from the trafficking of ivory from source countries in Africa to consumer markets in East Asia. Some EU Member States are unfortunately used as transit hubs by the traffickers. Of all the ivory that is being seized by national customs authorities, by far the biggest share concerns such transit shipments from Africa to Asia. Under the EU Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking, we have worked with Member States since 2016 towards the tightening of controls and increasing of relevant capacities. We are also working with third countries at both ends of the trade flow: to help them fight poaching on the ground in Africa and to reduce demand for ivory in Asia. In addition, we have increased the development cooperation budget to fight elephant poaching and with contributions to the African Elephant Fund. The current discussion about domestic ivory markets in the EU and elsewhere must be set against this broader global background. The Conference of the Parties to the CITES Convention adopted a resolution on this at its last meeting in 2016. The resolution calls on countries to close their domestic markets for commercial ivory trade if there is a legal market that is contributing to poaching or illegal trade. Already we have in place strict rules on ivory trade in the European Union: imports of ivory into the EU and exports from the EU have been banned since 1975 in respect of Asian elephants, and since 1990 in respect of African elephants. For ivory items that have been in Europe for a long time, domestic trade is strictly regulated with a system of certificates and demonstration of legal origin by traders. The rules were tightened further in May 2017 with the adoption of a specific Commission guidance document. Since then, the export of old raw ivory from the EU has no longer been possible. EU Member States have unanimously supported this additional tightening of the rules and are following the guidance very closely, thereby ensuring uniform application of the rules. With this measure, the risk that ivory exported from Europe could fuel the demand in destination markets, and indirectly also the poaching in Africa, has been significantly reduced. But we did not stop there. Towards the end of last year the Commission organised a public consultation to gather relevant data and to consult widely on possible additional measures regarding exports and sales of ‘Old World’ ivory items. The consultation attracted many responses and a clear majority of respondents called for far-reaching measures against domestic ivory trade. Those calls are often based on the precautionary principle, rather than on any specific evidence for systematic links between the legal ivory trade in the EU and elephant poaching in Africa. On the other hand, EU stakeholders, such as makers of musical instruments or antique dealers, used the consultation to highlight the impact of any additional restrictive measures on their sources of livelihood. The Commission is currently reflecting on the way forward and it will report to Parliament and the Council in the context of its progress report on the Wildlife Trafficking Action Plan.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 405, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Sirpa PIETIKÄINEN", "mepid": "40599", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, Africa’s elephant population is drastically declining and, at the same time, globally the legal ivory trade is – and remains – at the same level that it was at six years ago, even though different kinds of attempts have been made globally.

I would like to thank the EU Member States and the Commission for taking these steps forward, but this is not yet adequate. Illegal poaching and the illegal ivory trade will not stop as long as legal trade in any form is open. We need to close the domestic markets. The EU is still the largest domestic market for ivory in the world and, by the way, we are also a major transit point for illegal trading in wildlife goods.  China has banned the ivory trade domestically, the UK has one of the most stringent bans and the same goes for the USA and Hong Kong. What is actually needed now is for the EU to close its domestic markets totally. Exclusion through special permits would be allowed for some antique instruments or issues like that, but normal domestic trade should not continue anymore.

In April 2015, I sponsored an exhibition in the Brussels Parliament for the Born Free Foundation.

Prince William’s speech in China endorsed our position, and last week in the British House of Commons, they voted for what will soon be one of the toughest bans on the trade of ivory in the world. This UK ban will be tougher than America’s and China’s, but nations acting alone cannot succeed in closing the market. Only global action can stamp out the trade in ivory and turn back the tide towards elephant extinction, and not forgetting the rhinoceros. We in the UK have consistently taken the lead; we were the first country to ban cosmetics testing on animals in 1998, but it took the European Union six years. With 20 000 animals slaughtered annually, waiting six years is not an option, Commissioner. As long as Europe has a large market for ivory, the poaching of elephants will continue. I want future generations to be able to enjoy our world’s diverse wildlife, not just read about it in history books. So if we act together now and close down this European ivory market, we can make a huge contribution towards saving these magnificent animals and stop the criminals who currently profit from the trade.

We all know that, the public knows it, and it has to stop. But the EU is sitting still while others are taking real action. China and Hong Kong have closed their ivory markets, and even the UK, as we have just heard, is now coming forward with a total ban on all ivory.

We assume that if an ivory carving, a knife handle or a snooker ball has paperwork saying it is pre-1947, it is legal and can be sold as antique – but that’s not always the case. An Oxford University study to be released later this month shows that over two thirds of ivory sold legally on the EU market is in fact not pre-1947. It’s clear that illegally-poached ivory is getting into the legal markets, and it’s the marketplace that’s driving demand, and that is driving the killing. Criminal gangs control this profitable trade. They forge paperwork and they get their new or reworked ivory onto the market. The only place where ivory belongs or should have any value is on the front of a live elephant. So Commissioner, no half measures. All ivory trade is driving slaughter. Thousands of tonnes of ivory representing thousands of elephants – for what? Trinkets and criminality. We need a full and comprehensive EU-wide ban on ivory, with appropriate exemptions, now.

At the time, I was calling for a European ban on the ivory trade, without loopholes. Because illegal ivory always finds its way to the legal circuit. I repeat my plea today. Ivory trade is deadly to biodiversity and threatens to turn elephants and rhinos into 'living dinosaurs'. But the ivory trade has other disastrous and often deadly consequences. Every year, the trade puts billions of euros in the hands of criminals, militias and terrorist organisations, creating insecurity and instability.

The title of the report itself may be somewhat confused, as research leading up to this document shows that the biggest barrier is not infrastructure shortages or the price of accessibility, but educational shortages. Of course, for the world of culture, the possibilities for creating new goods are the most important: talent, work, but also, of course, financial opportunities. Nevertheless, many educational neglects are a key barrier to cultural acceptance.  Of course, responsibility for the development of culture falls on state governments and local governments at all levels. It should include three elements at the same time: the training of artists, the education of the public and the construction of infrastructure for the first and second meetings. What is particularly worth highlighting in the report? Firstly, the catalogue of human rights to culture (we have 47 existing legal bases in this document), recognising culture as a key area of activity, recognising the importance of creative industries, also for Europe's economic prosperity, recognising the role of cultural dialogue, rejecting cultural exclusions, recognising the importance of cultural heritage, the need to protect and promote, and the need to take into account technological and civilisational changes for cultural participation. It is worth mentioning here Article 27 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on the right of every person to participate freely in culture. What does culture give us? A chance to better understand the world. It helps build a knowledge-based society. It is the most important source of inclusive processes, a source of wealth, creates an area of special values, including positive emotions.  Which provisions of the report should be considered as key? There are 70 of them, not counting the preamble and the points of justification. Rather, I will cite those that are illustrative in order to show the scale of the references. Firstly, the need to build cultural strategies for children and young people. This is also a recommendation to the Member States. Recognising access to culture as one of the priorities of the European Union's political agenda. The need to simplify rules, rigours and tax systems that primarily include artists. Linking participation more closely to culture with accessibility – it is all about the richness of infrastructure. The need to provide financial guarantees, public funds for culture (here we have a call for financial protection even in times of crisis). To draw attention to the fact that financing cultural activities is not only an expense is also an investment. The quality of access to culture is a source of strengthening the creative economy. The need to reduce the tax burden across borders. Making tax policy more difficult in the Area of the European Union, especially with regard to VAT. In addition to exclusions due to age, health, lack of infrastructure, especially in the place of residence, there is a new exclusion – digital exclusion.  I would like to thank the data-acquisition staff (Eurostat and Eurobarometer) very warmly. These are the main key years 2011-2016. Let me remind you: the cultural sector is more than 8 million employees, that is, 3.7% of those working. As many as 36% of Europeans did not attend any cultural event in 2015, but as many as 83% of young people in turn took part in such an artistic event, which I would also like to draw attention to.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 422, "date": "2018-06-13.json", "name": "Bogdan Andrzej ZDROJEWSKI", "mepid": "124893", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Committee on Culture and Education (CULT) and in particular the rapporteur, Bogdan Zdrojewski, for his work on this report. It raises the crucial issue of structural and financial barriers preventing access to culture. Culture is not a side issue or an added extra. On the contrary, it is at the heart of the European project. This was confirmed by the Heads of State and Government in their conclusions last December. Culture is part of our identity. It gives meaning to historical events and feelings, and it helps us to communicate across languages and nationalities. Culture and creativity are also important engines for economic growth, yet figures show that more than one third of Europeans do not participate in cultural activities at all. I share your analysis regarding the obstacles preventing wider cultural participation, both on the demand and supply sides. More efforts are needed to promote interest in culture, starting with children at a young age. At the same time, we need to ensure a market for cultural and creative professionals that is less fragmented, and where they have sufficient access to finance and enjoy viable contractual conditions. Your valuable recommendations fed into the preparation of the proposal for a new European Agenda for Culture that the Commission presented in May. The new agenda intends to exploit synergies between culture and education, to strengthen links with other policy areas, and to help the cultural and creative sectors to grasp the opportunities of the digital shift. The Commission will play its part to help Member States achieve these goals. Let me give you a few concrete examples. First, under the Creative Europe programme, the Commission will launch a project on cultural and creative spaces and cities to promote cultural participation and social and urban regeneration. Second, we will support regions in focusing their smart specialisation and macro—regional strategies on culture. Here the Commission is already promoting sustainable cultural tourism through a dedicated European initiative as part of the European Year of Cultural Heritage. Third, we will organise regular dialogue with the cultural and creative sectors in the context of the renewed industrial policy strategy. This will identify policy needs and support a comprehensive policy framework at EU level. Finally, the Commission will propose a mobility scheme for professionals in the cultural and creative sectors under Creative Europe. We cannot have this discussion without mentioning the important role of the European Year of Cultural Heritage. One of the objectives of the year is to make cultural heritage accessible to all by removing social, cultural and physical barriers. I am grateful for the continued enthusiasm of the Parliament for the European Year, and I would like to use this opportunity to warmly thank President Antonio Tajani for organising a high-level event dedicated to the year in the European Parliament on 26 June. I hope that many of you will be able to take part. Let us keep up the momentum of the year and work together to ensure its legacy. Turning again to Mr Zdrojewski’s report: you stress the importance of proper financing and public support. This is indeed critical. The current Creative Europe programme already helps by promoting the circulation of cultural and creative works and of artists across borders – but we have to do more. This is why, in our proposal for the future Creative Europe programme published two weeks ago, we propose a funding increase of around 34%. This will enable us to reinforce support across the board, to add specific sectoral activities, to support the mobility of cultural and creative people and to encourage the activities of the European cultural and creative sectors on the world scene. I would ask you to support our proposal for the future Creative Europe in the tough negotiations ahead. We have a great opportunity to create an ambitious framework for culture: a framework that will enable more Europeans from all backgrounds to take part in cultural activities, and a framework that will boost the circulation of European artworks and help cultural professionals and artists perform or work in other countries.

I, too, congratulate Colleague Zdrojewski on a very good report on the issue of access to culture. This is the underlying theme of cultural policy, considered from both a national and a Community perspective, but above all crucial from a citizens' perspective. I draw attention to the use of new technologies for cultural purposes, which is particularly important because it allows us to reach new, hard-to-reach or non-traditional audiences. We are talking about digital tools. Properly applied and implemented and supported by digital skills at an appropriate level, they can overcome barriers to access to culture conditioned by factors such as geographical disadvantage, disability, social origin, language, lack of time or financial resources. I believe that digital tools can be a means of overcoming social barriers and, in this context, digital education should be part of the learning process from an early age in order to develop the right competences and knowledge. Public support remains the main means of financing cultural activities. I, too, point out that fiscal policy can play an important role in financing the cultural and creative sectors by introducing reduced VAT rates. In this context, better coordination of national cultural and fiscal policies as a tool to stimulate cultural participation is important.

The first commitment, to ensure greater investment and differentiated cultural mobility for the outermost, mountainous and remote regions. We also ask for funding so that schools can visit cultural institutions, as well as we ask for internship scholarships in cultural institutions. In this report, we also advocate the generalisation of the European Student Card and free access to the cultural institutions of the European Union, precisely through that card.

European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said artists and creators were the jewels of the crown. More recently, the President of this Parliament has said, and I quote, \"that culture more than the economy unites us\". Now, if culture has to be a gamble, then why do we have only 0.15% of the current European Union budget for the Creative Europe programme? Why don't we see a greater focus in funding for culture in the future, too?

I would like to see what this other Europe would look like that would choose to invest more in culture. Investing in culture is investing in democracy, investing in human dignity and memory, our memory.  This implies, I insist, the political courage to geographically decentralise the investment made in culture and to invest in cultural mobility.

Cultural participation should be cross-cutting and be embedded within multiple policy areas if it is to truly have an impact.  Digital innovations have opened up new ways for people to access, produce and disseminate cultural content, but we need to do more to ensure that people have the digital skills and infrastructure in order to participate. Many rural areas, including those in my constituency in North West England, are still left behind without adequate broadband coverage. In the United Kingdom, the Conservative Party has chosen to place austerity at the centre of its ideologically-driven political agenda. Civic spaces such as libraries, museums, galleries and swimming pools have closed down at an alarming rate, preventing citizens from accessing information, activities and opportunities to develop skills. For minority groups and those with multiple barriers, the effects have been profound.  So as this report eloquently outlines, access to culture in school is vitally important to encourage lifelong cultural participation. But despite this, the UK Government has introduced policies which actively prevent large numbers of secondary school children from studying any creative and cultural subjects.

I also accept it as a thank you to the work of all those who prepared the data for this report, because it lasted the longest. On the other hand, as regards the conclusions, I would like to remind you that it is education that can today be regarded as the most important element in determining the quality of participation in culture. Yes, the size of this participation is also determined by other elements, including material, infrastructure, etc., while education, shortcomings, shortcomings, errors in educational processes are absolutely crucial and decisive for the quality of life and participation in culture. The second conclusion, which is very important, is a little surprising: today demand is more important than supply in the cultural area. It has happened that, as a result of the various barriers that I am talking about in this report, supply is very, very attractive and, it can be said, interesting also from the point of view of diversity, quantity and size, etc., etc., but we have problems with demand. As many as 40% of Europeans do not consider participation in culture to be important, crucial, in some cases even necessary. The third element: the rudimentary role in adopting participation in culture belongs to the family and the school. These two elements, these two addresses are especially important. I draw attention to this in my report. Another thing: the need to remove fiscal obstacles to the mobility of artists and cultural professionals.

This is, brushed with a touch of lyricism, the fate of so many rural French municipalities, where the destitution of the cultural offer is a reflection of a dramatic desertification, which sees the key under the door 7,000 cafes per year and the commercial vacancy rate peak at 10%.  Far from being incidental, access to culture conditions the prospects of these cities, because why would a company invest in it tomorrow if it cannot offer its employees the living environment they take?

Mr President, access to culture is not self-evident. Neither is participating in culture. In the Netherlands, a year of cuts in the cultural sector was implemented in 2011. Eur 200 million was cut in the cultural sector. Subsidies were cancelled, because Secretary of State Halbe Zijlstra felt that individuals could also pay for art and culture themselves. Art and Culture thus became a matter for the elite. In fact, tax regulations in the Netherlands make it possible for the elite to invest in art and culture. This is despite the fact that both are enriching society as a whole.  These cuts have still not been completely reversed. As far as I am concerned, this must be changed: access to culture from schools, community centres and libraries must be restored. That is why I am calling for a European approach to making culture accessible to all. The structural and financial barriers to culture must be removed.  Europe calls on the Member States not to go bald in times of tightness. Public access to art and culture increases people's involvement in (European) society.

It is necessary to facilitate investment and diversify the funding of the cultural and creative sectors in order to unlock the potential of these sectors to generate growth and jobs. They have an impact on artistic activities, skills development, digitalisation, innovation and the formulation of new business models, as well as strengthening the competitiveness of the European cultural and creative sectors. The report cites useful solutions, calling for the inclusion of access to culture and participation in culture in other policy areas.

Participation in cultural activities is one of the ways in which a sense of belonging to society is created. As we discuss the accessibility of culture, let us remember that cultural activities can help to strengthen self-confidence and improve quality of life, especially for those who suffer from some marginalisation as a result of unemployment, illness or other causes. Taking this opportunity, it is worth considering the rapporteur's proposal for supporting the inclusive cultural sector, in which everyone can have equal opportunities to participate and develop their creative skills, regardless of their socio-economic, cultural or religious context or disability. As far as culture is concerned, we must take into account the fact that Europe's cultural heritage is unique in the world with its diversity and the richness of Christian culture. It is worth using the opportunity to expand cultural and religious tourism, which can be one of the key factors determining economic development, as well as to promote social cohesion and inclusion. Unfortunately, financial aspects are always one of the main obstacles to cultural accessibility and the participation of cultural activities.
