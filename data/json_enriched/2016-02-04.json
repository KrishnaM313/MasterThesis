Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EUROPEAN Union explicitly recognises that island regions as a whole are characterised by permanently unfavourable conditions. As outlined in the Sixth Report on Economic, Social and Territorial Cohesion, the impact of the crisis has seriously affected the development opportunities of many disadvantaged regions, including island regions.  The islands in the European Union are also peripheral regions located at the external borders of the Union. This makes them particularly vulnerable to the challenges that Europe currently faces, such as globalisation, demographic trends, climate change, energy supply, and in particular in southern regions, exposure to increasing migratory flows.  The connectivity of island regions with the continent is a major factor in the development of their full potential. Therefore, particular emphasis should be placed on transport links, intermodal transport and sustainable mobility, as well as on the development of digital capacity, which is vital to compensate for connectivity disadvantages.  Due to these and other factors, the EU should adopt specific measures to improve the social, economic and territorial cohesion of island regions. However, in the preparation of the 2014-2020 programming period, eu island regions received no specific funding, only the possibility of modulating co-financing rates for certain types of islands. In this context, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to ask the European Commission: Can the European Commission provide a clear definition of the type of permanent natural or demographic handicaps under Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EUROPEAN Union that island regions at NUTS 2 and NUTS 3 are expected to face? What specific cohesion policy instruments and resources are available to address the adverse conditions arising from the island nature of these territories? What action will the Commission take in the future to comply with Article 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union with regard to the recognition of the permanent disadvantages faced by nuts 2 and NUTS 3 island regions as permanent obstacles that may affect the achievement of cohesion policy objectives?  Does the European Commission consider that other indicators other than GDP could be taken into account, which are not limited to measuring economic production and take into account the specificities of islands, such as the Regional Competitiveness Index, in order to better reflect the economic and social vulnerability caused by the permanent natural handicaps faced by these regions? I look forward to the Commission's response.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, Madam President Mihaylova, dear colleagues, I would like to begin by thanking the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development for this oral question on support for islands, restricted regions within the European Structural and Investment Funds.  I would like to say from the outset that I am particularly concerned about this subject. Last year we had two meetings: the annual meeting in Guadeloupe and another meeting in Réunion, and in the last session in Strasbourg we had a meeting, together with my colleague, Commissioner Karmenu Vella, with all nine Members of the European Parliament coming from the outermost regions, precisely with the idea of seeing to what extent we can, at the beginning of the 2014-2020 programming period , to help these regions, which, as you said, in addition to being very far from Europe, have a number of specific problems.  As you know, our funds, European funds have a long-standing and successful tradition in supporting regions with specific geographical characteristics, including here also island regions that face various social, economic and environmental challenges and that require a specific approach on a case-by-case basis. These issues are, in my opinion, in the new regulation, the one concerning the 2014-2020 programming period, which calls on the Member States, where appropriate, to establish an integrated approach within the framework of the Partnership Agreements in order to address the specific needs of regions experiencing severe and sometimes permanent handicaps.  This is why a number of islands already benefit from a derogation in terms of the thematic concentration of investments from the European Regional Development Fund. Other islands have greater flexibility in taking into account their specific needs. In addition, the outermost regions that are all islands also benefit from a number of exceptions and specific conditions, thus seeking to make up for the serious and permanent constraints they face.  But, of course, as you pointed out, I also believe that we can do more. The Commission shall monitor the situation in the NUTS-2 and NUTS-3 regions. The Commission has created a number of synthetic indicators that take into account, for example, the regional competitiveness index or the human development index. Unfortunately, the data that we have and have at our disposal are not precise enough at the moment to reflect the specific characteristics of all island regions, but we continue to invest in data collection and forecasts, which will allow us to present a more detailed analysis of the situation in these regions in the next Cohesion Report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Salvatore CICU", "mepid": "124854", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, we must not Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today is an important day for me, because my initiative – thanks, of course, to the procedure laid down by Parliament and which provides for the Commission – comes to this House. This is a central issue. I would, however, like to turn to the Commissioner to give her some concrete examples and to make it clear better and more how, in some way, her reflection, although appreciable, is also a little distant from reality.  The islands do not have access to the market. The islands today find themselves with the handicap and disadvantage of speaking only one language, the language that the Union must decide whether the support given to them is called State aid and is legitimate. Low-cost companies run away from the islands, multinationals run away from the islands. This means a lack of territorial continuity, it means a lack of competition with regard to the price of energy. The islands cannot, through their small and medium-sized enterprises, achieve the process of internationalisation because they are strategically abandoned. I think it is essential to understand that, when we talk about freight and people transport, we have a monopoly of companies and when it comes to the tourist system, the tourist system cannot be supported because there is no deseasonalisation. All this is related to the fact that the islands do not have dedicated funding. Therefore, Commissioner, these regulations you mentioned are weak and are certainly to be reviewed, evaluated and strengthened. We have important strategic objectives to define for territories that are abandoned. I would therefore ask you to reconsider this position with regard to the strategic framework of future programming.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Michela GIUFFRIDA", "mepid": "124864", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank my fellow Members for the work they have done on this resolution that we have promoted and I thank the Commissioner for being present at this debate and for the attention she is giving to the condition of the islands.

The islands are among the territories with the greatest weaknesses; structural and natural characteristics represent their extraordinary wealth but also their enormous weakness. Today we are asking the Commission strongly to define these weaknesses and to define the shortcomings that prevent and hinder the growth and economic development of our islands. It is a bitter reality: mobility on the islands is reduced, fuel costs more, producers have more difficulty exporting and tourists also find it difficult to get there. However, these disadvantages can become resources. We need dedicated programming that takes account of the specific characteristics of the islands. That is why it is essential for the Commission to set up an island window made up of experts to coordinate and evaluate policies for island regions.

As a resident of the Croatian island of Korcula, I often feel it on my own skin. Traffic isolation and unavailability of various products and services, notable in the field of health and education, are just some of the challenges facing the island population. The lack of jobs due to the drastic decline in production capacity and the outflow of young people further contribute to the difficult image of the island. But the challenges facing the islands must not be a cause of desperation but an incentive to exploit all potentials. To achieve this, we need to attract investors and the workforce to the islands, and this is only possible through incentive tax policies, deregulation and infrastructure investments in cooperation with the private sector.

We agree with the majority of what is expressed in the motion for a resolution, such as the desirability of using other indicators in addition to GDP. Let's take an example, Sardinia. According to the European Union, it is in good health and has a GDP of 77%, so it is excluded from the funds for disadvantaged areas, but at the same time has very high unemployment. We can very well say that the Union will also be vigilant, but it seems to me that it is also suffering from strabrism. The time for words is over, we have to face reality and give solutions, the citizens call us to do so. One of the problems of the islands is transport and energy. Well, Sicily has a very low rate of absorption of funds, due to the administrative inability of regional governments, and a transport system that is not up to the standards of the governments of the developed countries. But all the governments, from Berlusconi to Renzi, we must say, are vague on a bridge over the Straits, which is useless, harmful and, what is more, in a seismic zone. Instead, we could start the transition to a third industrial revolution, which would achieve a model of development based on renewable sources, sustainable transport, the Internet of Things.

Concrete examples show that not only are they not being helped but they are being damaged. European fisheries regulations are a total disaster as they have put thousands of workers in port. European agricultural regulations are demented because they have benefited from the import of products from the other side of the Mediterranean, closing thousands of farms and leaving hundreds and hundreds of fields and territories uncultivated.

Mr President, in a Europe where respect for diversity is a basic principle, it is not enough simply to know areas with permanent peculiarities and disadvantages. The problems of island regions are many and must be prevented from being isolated. Targeted initiatives are needed to overcome the chronic problems they face and in many cases lead to problems of access to basic goods, such as water, as well as the deprivation of basic services such as healthcare.

Commissioner, speaking today of insularity, that is to say the need for multifaceted support for The European islands, this, at least for my own country, that is to say the Greek islands, is not the case. It has been abolished in practice. It has been abolished, firstly, because the Greek islands are also paying for the consequences of memorial policies, austerity policies. Special tax regimes applied to other European islands, such as reduced VAT, have been abolished in order to deal with the specificities that we know the Greek islands have. Airports have sold out to private and foreign interests, so it is doubtful whether there will be a reduction in transport costs, which you know is crucial when it comes to transport to the islands.

I wanted to assure you from the beginning about my constant concern about the specific problems facing the islands, the outermost regions.  As I was saying, last year I attended the annual meeting in Guadeloupe. This year, the annual meeting of the outermost regions will take place in Madeira. Last month – two weeks ago, in fact – in Strasbourg, I met with a number of you who are Members of the European Parliament representing outermost regions, and I wanted to join me and the Commissioner for Climate Change, Mr Karmenu Vella, because I know that a number of you have specific problems with fisheries policies, maritime policies and so on.  As I was telling you from the outset, these outermost regions and, in general, the islands belong to Member States, and from this point of view, I was pleased that, even in December, the European Court of Justice issued a communiqué and obliged the Member States to take into account the outermost regions in the operational programmes and the specificities of these outermost regions. We confess to you that we have a permanent dialogue with the Member States, in order to pay particular attention to the outermost regions, the islands and those with a particular situation.  As I said at the beginning, the financial and political framework for the European Structural and Investment Funds for the period 2014-2020 is an important step to better meet the specific needs of island regions. I want to assure you that I have also recommended that the governors of these islands, the governors of the outermost regions, have a more active, more proactive role, because it is not enough for us, from the European Commission, to go once a year to an island. As you said, there is no way to know the reality, unless there is a mutual dialogue, constant in bringing to our attention the problems we face. From this point of view, you can count on me, on the Commission. As far as Greece is concerned, you know very well, last year I was here before you, calling for extraordinary measures for an extraordinary situation. We have managed to change the regulations and we have 100% co-financing – so, in fact, it can no longer be called co-financing. Basically, from this point of view, I think that, from our point of view, we have done everything we can for Greece. I share what was said here. More than 880,000 people came to Greece in 2015 alone. It is a huge burden and I assure you that the Commission is working very closely with the Greek authorities to support Greece on this huge challenge.  But I would like to tell you that it's all about administrative capacity. You mentioned the island of Lesbos. I met with the Governor there, explained to her to what extent she could use European funds. Unfortunately, Greece is one of the countries that does not want to use European funds for this migration problem, although there is a possibility that, with a small part of the amount, it will make mobile hospitals, kindergartens and so on. Italy is the only country that has called for the change of operational programmes and already the European Commission has transferred EUR 220 million to Italy, precisely for this purpose.  In any case, I know the problems that Greece has and I want to assure you that, in general, in relation to the islands, we are doing everything we can to meet the specific needs.  Many Member States, unfortunately, do not want these regions to be treated separately. Greece, for example, in the Accession Treaty wishes to be regarded as a single country and in the operational programmes and in the Partnership Agreement makes no particularity with regard to the special conditions of the islands, as, for example, France specifies in the Partnership Agreement that there are outermost regions such as Réunion, French Guiana, Guadeloupe and so on.m,d., which require special policies. So, as I was saying, this is a shared responsibility and, especially with regard to the implementation of European funds, I believe that this is 100% the responsibility of the Member States. As mentioned above, we have a number of specific instruments and derogations that are in place. The challenge for all of us in the period ahead is to improve regional policy in order to best meet the needs of all regions and future challenges. I want to assure you of my availability. We have requested and may be able to organise a meeting on this subject in Brussels this year. We must ensure, as you said, that island regions not only meet the challenges they currently face, but also that, on the basis of their European peculiarities, they contribute better to achieve the objectives of the European Union. I want to assure you that we are working closely with the outermost regions, with the islands. As I was saying, I also visited several islands in Italy, Sicily. We want European funds to be used as best as possible in order to have a positive impact in these economies, particularly in the fight against unemployment and, of course, the use of energy resources.  There is a big problem that you have also raised here in relation to transport connections. I understand very well. Someone said here they'd switch four planes. This is where we work together. It is the sovereignty of the Member States, as I was saying. For example, France contributes money from the budget to help citizens of these outermost regions have a lower cost. Other countries, such as Spain, for example, are calling on the European Commission to subsidise ticket costs for these citizens, which is not in our capacity-building power.  So I think we need to talk more about the specific problems of the islands, I am absolutely convinced that this is a major problem, I am absolutely convinced that we need derogations. That is why, as I said earlier, I have a permanent discussion with both Commissioner Vestager, with regard to State aid, and with Mr Vella, because I am aware that, as we have a very strict policy on fisheries, we need derogations for these islands, which are facing major problems.  So, from this point of view, I believe that the 2014-2020 programming period, which you have adopted as a co-legislator, brings an important step but, on the other hand, there is still much to be done and I am at your disposal to gather together the best ideas and discuss how to proceed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 28, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   I have received one motion for a resolution pursuant to Rule 128(5) of the Rules of Procedure.

Regional and local authorities of self-government are closest to citizens and better understand local problems and specificities. They have the advantage in formulating policies and initiatives aimed at improving citizens' lives in the areas of job creation, innovation, health, environment, energy, transport – we can continue this list for a long time. On the other hand, regional and local authorities, as a result of their limited resources, need more significant budget support and co-financing of projects than at national level.  In implementing cohesion policy, the level of consultation of regional and local authorities varies considerably between Member States, with some Member States still not taking the partnership principle enshrined in European legislation seriously enough. In general, regional and local authorities in federal Member States have a greater opportunity to shape national policies because of the powers at their disposal – powers that have an impact at pararegional and local level.  It is important to stress that improving administrative capacity at local and regional level is a key factor in better strategic planning and implementation of operational programmes, as well as for the more efficient implementation of structural and cohesion funds. It is important to note that cities are drivers for economic growth and employment, centres for the development of art, culture and creativity, a platform for innovation and emerging enterprises. Smart cities and smart specialisation strategies are innovative practices translated into specific European Union policies or initiatives. Furthermore, the 2015 Riga Declaration will lead to the Amsterdam Pact. The Pact aims at increasing the participation of European cities in proposing, drawing up and implementing specific initiatives and programmes within the framework of urban development.  Last but not least, the role of regional and local authorities is also important in developing cross-border links and initiatives, part of European territorial cooperation.  In this context, I would like to ask the European Commission, in the face of Commissioner Crezzo, to answer the following questions as defined by the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Policy: What specific support will the European Commission give to regional and local authorities with a view to strengthening their impact role, as well as for the management and concrete implementation of the ESI Funds for the period 2014-2020 , taking into account their respective responsibilities and the specificities of individual Member States in order to create economic growth and sustainable jobs?  And question two: Will the Commission hold a public consultation followed by a possible initiative to strengthen the role of regional and local authorities?  In addition to these issues, I would like to stress that they are of utmost importance to the Committee in the European Parliament, as the involvement of regional and local authorities is at the heart of the successful implementation of cohesion policy, i.e. at the heart of achieving the competitiveness, growth and job creation objective. The role of local and regional authorities is also at the heart of the future post-2020 cohesion policy planning.  I look forward to the Commission's responses and the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 33, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "n/a", "mepid": "n/a", "text": " Member of the Commission. Madam President Mihaylova, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I would first of all like to thank you for this oral question from the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development, which brings to the fore the role of local and regional authorities in the context of the European Structural and Investment Funds. You know very well that, from our point of view, we work every day with these local authorities, sub-national authorities that play a key role in the implementation of programmes financed by our funds, because they bring the European Union and European policies closer to people, while helping to implement projects financed by European funds much more effectively on the ground. From our point of view, from the European Commission, we rely heavily on the role of local authorities, on the role of managing authorities. We believe that they know best what is needed in a region, what can be done and what cannot be done. Regional policy has this fundamental feature because it adapts to the needs of each region. As you know, with your support, with the support of the European Parliament, we have managed to persuade the Member States to involve local and regional authorities in the decision-making process, both at the pre-legislative stage and throughout the entire programming period. I am grateful to the European Parliament for the fact that the new regulations bring, as an ex-ante conditionality, the principle of partnership, the principle of bringing to the table both non-governmental organisations and local authorities, because Europe is diverse: We have countries where this principle of partnership has been a tradition for decades, but we also have other countries where this principle is not fully integrated. I would therefore like to assure you that local authorities have been closely involved, both in negotiating partnership agreements and operational programmes, and in implementing projects at local and regional level. The European Commission is already conducting a study on the implementation of this partnership principle... (interrupted sound) in 2014-2020 and I assure you that the study will be made public in the coming months. For example, with regard to the integrated urban actions, to which you referred, Madam President Mihaylova, and which are very important, EUR 15 billion has been allocated to cities in the period 2014-2020 so that they can meet their specific development needs. It is the first time in the history of the European Union that the Commission has practically given money directly to cities. I think it is a reliable decision about the ability of these cities to decide on their needs and to spend the money on their citizens. The same is true of local development actions under the responsibility of the community, where both the public and private sector and civil society are at the forefront of implementing local development strategies. On the one hand, we are working closely with the Dutch Presidency of the Council to ensure that the European Union's Urban Agenda becomes a reality, so that cities really have a say. An example would be when it comes to the European Union's support in reducing urban poverty or the social inclusion of migrants. You referred, Madam President, to the Riga Declaration. The Amsterdam Declaration follows. As I was saying, the Dutch Presidency places particular emphasis on the Urban Agenda and is due to hold a meeting in Amsterdam in March with all the mayors of the European capitals and then, in June, we hope to have this Amsterdam Declaration. This is the first time that all Member States have agreed that an Urban Agenda is needed. You know that, until now, some Member States have invoked the principle of subsidiarity, refusing a specific European framework with regard to the Urban Agenda. We, too, in the Commission, and I am personally thinking of organising a meeting with a number of mayors – primarily mayors of the capitals most affected by the refugee issue – because, regardless of national refugee policy, some mayors are forced to take emergency measures in relation to the challenges they face. I believe that we need to help these cities, which are most affected, on the refugee issue. On the other hand, we support the administrative capacity of local and regional authorities so that they can really exploit the potential of European funds, and here I think you agree with me that European funds are not always everything. Money isn't always everything. We need, first of all, administrative capacity, the capacity to develop successful projects, because we are not developing projects in Brussels. He's not sitting in our power. We can't decide.

In the next programming period, which we will be discussing in a very short time, we believe that it absolutely must remain so. We have some concerns about this because, if the overall budget does not increase, it is quite clear that the increase in demand risks reducing resources in the sectors where these resources are most important. We believe that all regions should remain involved, including those of so-called competitiveness, and we believe that the full involvement of regions and local authorities must continue to be essential from the earliest stages of programming. We have always been in favour of coordination and coherence between the different sources of European investment, but we believe that cohesion policy remains an extraordinary force for growth and development and progress, as it has been up to now.

I have dedicated my entire political career to strengthening local and regional self-government units. Stronger cities, stronger municipalities, stronger regions have always meant a stronger quality of life for me. What I want to emphasize today is that I am 100% convinced that the principle of subsidiarity has no alternative. We really need to see the principle of subsidiarity to the end, as European practice is also known where the most normalised countries, such as Denmark, have by far the best standard, the best development. As far as the most centralized countries, such as my Croatia or like Greece, have major development problems, and there is something that is crucial alongside it. The key issue is absorption power. Today we have a common situation that supercentralized states do not have quality absorption power. That is why I am committed to the possible direct access of cities and regions to European funds, because we often have a political competition between a national government or some regional or local government. In this way, if we are going to have the possibility of direct access by local and regional authorities to European funds and various other sources of financing at the Level of Europe, I am sure that we will strengthen the quality and security of living in many cities and regions of the European Union.  Here I add the need for quality cross-border cooperation, financing cross-border cooperation, where we have excellent experience, for example IPA Adriatico is a fantastic good experience of good financing of cross-border cooperation and of course macro-regional cooperation.

I would also like to call on the Commission to develop a methodology to assess the effectiveness of the internal administrative structure of the Member States.

It is being done behind closed doors, it is being done in a dishonourable way, and the people have not had a chance to vote on it. This gives a bad reputation to the EU and to the whole idea of city regions and authorities. However, Madam Commissioner, there is an opportunity for you to show your personal honourable nature.

As far as I am concerned, you know very well, I believe that our main partners in terms of regional policy are represented by local and regional authorities, the presidents of the more than 280 regions. We have ongoing consultations. I believe that they are closest to people, they understand the local needs, policies and initiatives that can change people's lives in the area of job creation, innovation, health conditions, the environment, energy, transport. I know, on the other hand, that these regions have their own limits. Firstly, they need more than national authorities for budget support and co-financing of projects.  I also share your point of view: the role of cities is very important. I am grateful to the Dutch Presidency for attaching great importance to the urban agenda. More than 70% of Europe's population lives in cities in the European Union, be they capital or small and medium-sized cities. They are engines of growth and job creation.  I am also – and the whole European Commission is – grateful to the European Parliament for its support and contribution to the partnership principle, to which we are, of course, of major importance. I share Mr van Nistellrooij's view that a public debate is needed on how this principle of partnership and the principle of governance on various levels is applied.  Basically, next week I will be in the plenary of the Committee of the Regions, where we will discuss this subject, and I am sure that I will be very pleased to come before you and discuss this subject. I believe that an exchange of best practices is needed from this point of view. As I was saying, there are countries that have this culture, this tradition of developing projects together with civil society organisations, with academia. In other countries, local authorities basically consider that they are the only ones who can make decisions without consulting citizens and their representatives. So that is why we have paid close attention to ensuring that local and regional authorities are really involved in the negotiations of partnership agreements and operational programmes. You know very well that in the new programming period this principle represents an ex-ante conditionality.  I cannot answer all those who asked questions, but Mr Jakovčić asked a question that also came back to the speech of other colleagues. I would like to say that every country has the right to organise itself as it wishes. It is important that this organisation and the implementation of projects respond to the regulations and legality of the management of European funds. We have countries like Poland, for example, which is a centralised state, but which has performed very well in the area of European funds, but we also have, for example, the experience of France, which has now moved to a decentralised system and which works very well. Of course every country, as I said, has the right to organise itself as it wishes. In any case, we will continue to monitor how the partnership principle is implemented under Article 5 of the Common Provisions Regulation for European and Investment Funds.  On the issue of refugees, I would like to address your concerns. We are not forcing any state, no city, no region to use European funds. We have sent this letter to all ministers to let them know that we are willing to change operational programmes. We are aware that a year ago, when they were drafted, this refugee challenge did not exist. As I was saying, Italy is the only country that has called for the change of operational programmes and we have already directed EUR 220 million to mobile hospitals, kindergartens, social problems for the integration of migrants. Other countries, such as France, the Netherlands, Germany are already using European funds for the integration of migrants, but there is no link in our regulations between the allocation of European funds and the refugee issue.  I'd like to make one last point. I am quite amazed to see a UKIP representative talking about the need for European funds. I know you come from a less developed region, which has suffered a lot, where mines have been closed. I will be very pleased to join you and show the citizens of the United Kingdom to what extent cohesion policy has contributed to the retraining and creation of new jobs in such an affected region, and perhaps we will be able to contribute together to strengthening this idea of solidarity and the need for a united Europe.

The European Regional Development Fund Regulation provides that 5 % of the ERDF should be allocated to promoting integrated sustainable urban development actions, while bodies at urban, sub-regional and local level responsible for implementing sustainable urban strategies should be responsible for actions at least related to the choice of operations.

Unfortunately, there is little participation in these consultations by local actors in centralised states. Measures are therefore needed to increase the involvement of these authorities and to identify ways in which public consultations can become as attractive as possible.  Moreover, I am convinced that we can contribute to decision-making responsibility at these levels by encouraging participatory governance measures.

In addition to being a grave violation of international law, the illegal annexation has had a serious negative impact on the human rights situation. The systematic curtailment of residents’ basic human rights and fundamental freedoms is an emblematic feature of the current situation on the peninsula. The imposition of Russian laws and citizenship has created a situation of legal uncertainty and discrimination. The Crimean Tatar community and Tatar residents supporting the territorial integrity of Ukraine are paying a particularly high price for the views they express. Public events in Simferopol to commemorate the 1944 deportation have not been allowed. Tatar media outlets have been closed and the Mejlis, a self-governing body of Crimean Tatars and its activists, has been prosecuted. The appearing cases of enforced disappearances, torture and killing of young Crimean Tatars have not been properly investigated so far. High Representative Mogherini discussed these cases when she met in person the representative of the Mejlis of the Crimean Tatar People in Ukraine in November 2015. Let me also stress the EU’s concern over the detention and sentencing of Oleg Sentsov and Alexander Kolchenko. Their case, which the EU has monitored, is in breach of international law and elementary standards of justice. The EU will remain vocal in demanding their immediate release and safe return to Ukraine. Finally, the EU has repeatedly called for full, free and unrestricted access for international human rights actors to the whole territory of Ukraine, including Crimea and Sevastopol. We welcome those missions which have taken place so far: the mission of the Council of Europe’s Commissioner for Human Rights, Nils Muižnieks, in autumn 2014; the unofficial mission of Turkish prominent persons in spring 2015; and the continued work of the non—governmental Crimean Field Mission on Human Rights. We also praise the efforts of the UN and OECD, autonomous institutions which have so far been denied access to the peninsula but document human rights abuses using a wide variety of sources.

If we cannot unite on something like opposition to the death penalty, I do not think there is much hope for us. There are those in Bahrain who do feel that we focus too much upon the Kingdom; we criticise too much the lack of progress in Bahrain that we have seen in parts, and since there are other abuses in the region, why not focus upon them? Firstly, we do focus on other abuses in the neighbouring countries in the wider region, and secondly, in many ways it is a compliment, because there is a feeling within this House that there is scope for a dialogue with Bahrain that is actually going somewhere. There is actually a process towards reform that we can assist, and there are useful discussions to be had. It is important that we recognise the progress that Bahrain has made in a reform programme. There has been institutional reform; we have seen steps towards an independent judiciary; we have seen the establishment of ombudsmen; we have seen the establishment of the Prisoners’ Rights Commission and the special investigations unit; and there have been a number of declarations which have been really very positive. But that progress has stalled, and we need to see that progress continue. We can assist in that process by being vocal in our criticism but also constructive in our willingness to help. We must be vocal about our criticism of the sentencing to death of Mr Ramadan along with nine other individuals presently on death row within the Kingdom, and I hope we will be unanimous in our condemnation of those sentences.

The EU has been consistently engaging with local authorities at all levels, maintaining constant contacts with a wide range of Bahraini stakeholders and activists. Bahrain is an important partner in the Gulf region and has an important role to play in ensuring the stability of the Gulf region, which can best be achieved by strengthening the existing framework for the protection of human rights and individual freedoms. The EU will therefore continue to maintain an active dialogue with the country and its government and support Bahrain’s stability and development. We consider that this objective can be best achieved through a process of inclusive national reconciliation, leading to gradual political and socio-economic reforms based on dialogue and tolerance. Like many in Europe, we have been concerned by the death penalty sentence imposed on Mr Mohammed Ramadan and Mr Husain Ali Moosa for their alleged involvement in the February 2014 bomb explosion which killed a police officer, a sentence upheld by the Bahraini Court of Cassation on 16 November 2015. The EU is unreservedly opposed to the use of capital punishment under all circumstances, and its universal abolition will continue to remain a cornerstone of the EU’s foreign policy. Allegations regarding their possible mistreatment in detention, as well as the basis for their conditions, should also be fully investigated. The EU, both in Brussels and through its delegation in Riyadh, accredited to Bahrain, will continue to liaise with the Bahraini authorities to advocate the protection and promotion of human rights and fundamental freedoms, as per Bahrain’s international commitments, the recommendations set out by the Bahraini Independent Commission of Inquiry and the recommendations made during Bahrain’s universal periodic review process. The EU will continue to call on the Bahraini Government to act proportionately in all cases to protect the rights of individuals indicted as a result of criminal charges, as was done during the second visit of the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, in May 2015. On this occasion, the EU conveyed again its preoccupation as to the imposition of the death penalty, recalling its principled opposition to this inhumane and degrading punishment. The EU, in close coordination with the EU Member States represented in Manama, has been closely following developments related to these individual cases and to the overall human rights situation in the Kingdom of Bahrain. The European Union has expressed formally on many occasions that violence is not justified in any circumstances. The EU has also constantly called for transparent and due process and for the proper investigation of all alleged cases of ill-treatment and of torture. Bahraini human rights institutions should effectively tackle these matters in a transparent way, while the robust recommendations stemming from the National Human Rights Institution should be implemented in the interest of all the citizens. In this regard, the many steps taken by the Bahraini authorities to implement the recommendations of the Bahraini Independent Commission of Inquiry are positive and have the potential to improve the human rights situation in the country, but more is needed. The Ministry of the Interior’s ombudsman, the Prisoners and Detainees Rights Commission and the National Institution for Human Rights have an important and pro-active role to play by fulfilling their mandate in full independence and transparency. Let me once again assure you that we will continue to remain seized with the case of Mr Mohammed Ramadan and Mr Husain Ali Moosa, and to voice the EU’s concern through appropriate channels.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 113, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Adina-Ioana VĂLEAN", "mepid": "37324", "text": "   The debate is closed.

It calls for a sensitive political approach, with no less importance of human rights and human dignity, but has to be put in the context of the overall situation in the wider region and of the standards of democracy and respect for human rights in this region.

They were known for their criticism of the Beijing government for behind the scenes of Chinese rule and for various scandals. It is therefore a given that Hong Kong public opinion is now convinced that Beijing's leadership is responsible for the disappearance of these five well-known publishers. That is why we also have several protests by Hong Kong residents against the Government of China, calling for the release of the missing, but also for the consolidation of the right to freedom of expression of speech.  The European Union must therefore oppose the violation of human rights taking place in Hong Kong, and defend the freedom of speech and expression of publishing houses, journalists and citizens.

It has allowed Russia to dominate Serbia's energy market and has thus been exposed to future pressures. It is preparing a joint military exercise with Russia and supports the statements aimed at dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina. It therefore feels important to add to the report an encouragement to Serbia to continue on the path of rapprochement with the EU.  That is where Serbia's future lies.

Blocking the work of the Kosovar assembly by the opposition shows public disagreement over the agreement with Serbia. The mission, which was supposed to help the local administration adjust to European standards of the rule of law, turned out to be corrupt and linked to Kosovo criminals. The police and public administration are still corrupt, and the practically non-existent economy.

Certainly the most important moment is the signing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement, which we recently ratified here in the European Parliament. It is a kind of reward for Kosovo's commitment to full membership and a European future. But further progress will depend on the commitment and constructive cooperation of all political stakeholders, which is not the case now. Unfortunately, once again, the “regional” problem of the opposition's participation in parliament is emerging. The legislative framework has improved over the past year, the success of which will depend primarily on implementation, but organized crime, the level of corruption, high unemployment, especially among young people, and vulnerable free media remain strong.

However, the integration process requires resolving a number of pressing issues, such as violation of human rights, intolerance, corruption, organized crime, the problem of civil service and inefficient public administration, high unemployment, especially among women and young people, discrimination, inefficient infrastructure, etc. There is also no doubt that the integration process is to some extent slowed down due to the non-recognition of Kosovo by five EU Member States. Recognition of Kosovo would certainly help to strengthen stability in the region, facilitate the further normalization of relations between Serbia and Kosovo and increase the credibility of the Union's external policy.

According to the 2015 World Report, published by Human Rights Watch, 2.44 million people are currently in need of protection and various forms of humanitarian assistance. The humanitarian emergency is further aggravated by the strong political instability that characterizes the transitional institutions, supported by the international community, but opposed by the power and unrest of local militias.

However, in recent times an attempt has been made to replace fixed-wing aircraft with helicopter access, and the islanders are most dissatisfied with this proposal. Today, here, I just want to clarify that, as far as the EU regulation, under which the Public Service Obligation (PSO) operates, is concerned, the term used is ‘air carrier’, which is defined as an undertaking with a valid operating licence or equivalent. So the decision on the matter, whether fixed-wing or helicopter, lies with the national authorities, and the needs and wishes of the islanders should be complied with.

island regions, whether they be the geographical, natural and demographic handicaps of the islands as well as their inherent potential. The islands are all facades open to the world, particularly in the French case. With 11 million km2 of maritime surface, France is the second largest maritime territory in the world. I proposed, especially during Assises de la Mer, to make this new border a major axis for the ecological revival of activity. The resolution goes in this direction: development of alternative energies (marine, wind and solar), local markets essential by their insularity, new maritime routes and sustainable management of fishing. Many islands have special tax regimes to compensate for their natural and demographic handicaps.

The city context is, therefore, increasingly important in the management of public affairs, not only because of the material and territorial dimension, but also because cities correspond to spaces of greater proximity and mobilization, of citizenship, gaining an important political expression. There is a negative tendency to establish direct communication between the European Commission and \"cities\", without the intermediation of Member States and the necessary definition of priorities and strategies for their regions.

It is at this level that the needs of local communities can be best identified and the planned investments weave into the overall development strategy of the country. The possibility of using many European funds intended for leveling development disproportions between regions, modernizing rural areas or increasing the level of qualifications of the inhabitants is an undeniable advantage of our membership. However, in order to use this opportunity effectively, it is necessary to properly identify the investment needs of each region. The role of local and regional authorities in this process should be strengthened, because it is at these levels that the most important decisions are made every day. It is in the authorities of the region or commune that the first line of fight against the most important problems, such as inefficient communication, natural disasters or preparation of conditions for investments that create new jobs, is located. Of course, the mere inclusion of the commune council or voivodeship assembly in the decision-making process is not enough.

There are no other alternatives. Ancient communities that have existed since Islam did not exist at all are in danger of total destruction. They are seeking refuge. They fled.

Yet, as events have shown, the only viable solution for a peace process remains in the hands of sovereign states; Russia's diplomacy with the Syrian government is a good example. The European Union does not have to take the place of states, particularly when it has partially contributed to creating or worsening conflicts which have led to the rise of Daesh.

Earlier last week, I had the opportunity to attend the launch of the European Union Strategy for the Alpine Region, which took place in Brdo, Slovenia. This was the launch of the 4th macro-regional strategy and the enthusiastic response of the more than 500 participants certifies, once again, the need and importance of these macro-regional strategies. By getting involved in macro-regional strategies, European regions can work together to meet common challenges, thus contributing to territorial, economic and social cohesion. This cooperation is particularly relevant for improving the connectivity of regions, especially through the development of rail connections. Both the Danube Strategy and the Adriatic-Ionian Strategy have identified rail transport as one of their main priorities. Indeed, there are huge gaps between their regions in terms of public rail transport services, which undermine the common potential for economic development. For example, in what we call \"old Member States\", such as Italy, Germany and Austria, public services are largely satisfactory, although there is obviously room for improvement. In the new Member States, such as the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, the situation is unsatisfactory, but is improving, mainly due to the support provided by European funds. In contrast, in countries outside the European Union, public railway services are really inadequate and in dramatic need of reforms and investment. In this context, the European Commission considers that it is time to take vigorous measures to support public railway services in these regions. Actions should focus on the following: firstly, we certainly need closer and better cooperation between countries. There is no other way to succeed, at the micro-regional and macro-regional level. Secondly, we need the participating countries to work closely together to implement a series of railway reforms, such as the separation of infrastructure and operations, as well as the introduction of licenses and regulations. Third, we need investment in rehabilitation projects, removing bottlenecks and missing links in traffic management and capacity improvement systems. In this regard, I am pleased to say that the indicative value of the TEN-T network for the Western Balkans, which is currently in place, provides a useful framework for these investments. But, distinguished members of the European Parliament, we all know that only through cooperation, reforms and railway investment will we be able to overcome the current challenges. We must also work to improve project preparation, create and strengthen effective governance structures and align and simplify border crossing procedures. In particular, we need all parties involved to agree on a very clear principle: all public service contracts, rail transport, must be awarded on the basis of competitiveness.

As you know, Romania and Austria were the first states to submit to the Council and subsequently asked the Commission to prepare a strategy for the Danube region by the end of 2010. The strategy of this macro-region consisting of fourteen Member States of the European Union aims to address the challenges common to these countries, namely the growing need for mobility, energy sources and energy efficiency in the region, water quality and socio-economic development. Unfortunately, the more common the set of challenges, the different and unequal this economic development in the macro-region. Thus, tools are needed to accentuate and increase social, economic, but especially territorial cohesion. This also includes the General Transport Master Plan of Romania, a master plan that is a prerequisite for European funding and a strategic tool in terms of major development objectives of the national transport system, as well as investment needs for projects and infrastructure investments. . This master plan was adopted by political consensus by the Romanian Government and subsequently approved by the European Commission, following negotiations. Railway infrastructure projects are prioritized in line with the objectives of Union transport policy to create a single European transport area. That is why, Commissioner, I am pleased to see that there is coherence between regional development policy and rail transport policy in the Danube macro-region.

Thank you, Commissioner, for your explanation. Indeed, we have free mobility for people, goods and services as one of the fundamental freedoms in the EU. And with people, just as with goods, we naturally want to try to travel across Europe by rail. In most cases, however, this is not possible at all or not yet, and that is why we have to concentrate very strongly on this, especially with the macro-regions. Commissioner, you also said that rail links are a priority. And there is actually a lot going on. We cannot always connect all the islands in the same way - that would of course be great for those who are currently in the Adriatic region, but we cannot afford that. We just have to see where we actually have major deficits. And a macro-region also has the task of balancing out differences in its policy and ensuring that everyone has the same access. We have developed such a metro map for corridors across Europe that really connect everyone. And here I am only concentrating on three corridors that are in these regions. There is the Baltic-Adriatic corridor. We have a total of sixteen border crossings, nine of them by rail. Everywhere except Austria, ERTMS is missing, which is very important, and we have many bottlenecks on the railways, especially in Poland and Slovenia. The freight speed is sometimes so low that it is not possible to set up a freight operation there. The investment requirement for the railways alone would be 30 billion euros by 2030 - an enormous amount that we cannot afford! In the Orient and Eastern Mediterranean corridors, for example, the locomotive has to be changed six times if you want to travel from Athens to Hamburg. I know Hamburg is not the Adriatic or the Danube, but we still have to compensate for a lot of differences. And in the Rhine-Danube corridor, for example, we also have a lot of border crossings - eight by rail alone between Germany and the Czech Republic - where electrification and ERTMS are still missing in some cases. The rail network in Romania is in urgent need of modernization and connection.

A few months ago we had the climate conference in Paris. The EU was very committed to the climate goals. We have to do that! Transport is responsible for 25% of all emissions and is the only sector where they have increased since 1990, by 22%; in industry they have fallen by 38%. That is why we have to change mobility in order to achieve the climate goals. Mobility is a matter of general interest and therefore rural areas must also be recognized; they need to be connected. And please don't make Portugal's mistake again! In Portugal we shut down many rail networks ten or fifteen years ago - people should drive cars. Today they have no more money to drive their cars, the rail lines have been shut down, and mobility has been destroyed. We heard about the master plan and that is why we have requested this debate. 30 to 40% of the rail traffic in Romania is to be shut down. The government had decided that, and the Commission also agreed. If you do that, you can never reach the climate goals! Therefore you have to make it very clear: the railways must have priority. 60% of the structural funds go into the streets, only 20% into the railways. You have to change that and not follow the example of shutting down 30 to 40% of the railway lines! And of course the shorter distances also play a major role, because 90% of the passengers on the rail travel on distances of less than 50 kilometers. Don't just think of the big projects, not just TNT, but the connections. A network - that is the crucial thing that we have to enforce. And as far as the European rail network is concerned: this is a patchwork quilt with the gaps exactly where the borders are. So you need to create better incentives for Member States to re-establish the cross-border connections that were destroyed by the war and the post-war era. We can secure mobility and protect the climate, but not by shutting down 30 to 40% of the rail network in Romania.

And especially in the area of ​​railway infrastructure, which we are debating here today, I feel that we have a great debt. The Iron Curtain has fallen, but the railway connection, for example between the Czech Republic and Germany, is still insufficient, it does not correspond to how today two neighboring friendly states could have interconnected railway infrastructure. I see the problem in the fact that if we want to invest more in this cross-border cooperation in the future and, for example, strengthen railway infrastructure, much more money will need to be allocated to such projects. Given that today, around EUR 222 million is earmarked for the Danube strategy, this is an amount that will not cover a single major railway infrastructure project. For example, we had an analysis of how much the modernization of the line Prague, Pilsen, Nuremberg, or Munich would cost, and that amount corresponds to the amount of EUR 1.4 billion, ie. more than five times higher than in the whole fund. So I think that in the future we should also address within the budget how much those cross-border projects should be more symbolic. It is supposed to be a place of transport and railways, for example, strengthening cycle paths, which are also in this project, I also welcome them, cycling is certainly important, but it probably does not, we all feel as important and strategic as the issue of railway infrastructure.

Today we are dedicated to the specific sector of railways and public services. As the CEF rapporteur for the Connecting Europe Facility, I must admit that it was a miracle of solidarity between the East and the West to achieve that there were 10 billion euros for the CEF from the Cohesion Fund for a very complex ambition, and therefore Therefore, I am especially grateful for it. But here, in the CEF itself, there were two networks: the basic one, which was the nine multimodal corridors - that is, with everything, not just rail: road, inland waterway and whatever - and the global one. The global was the national plans. And so we put it. And I remember that, at that time, Romania had not presented its national plan - the previous Government - and the new Government - the Government of Mr. Ponta - had to present it in the last moments. And it was complex. Still, it was achieved. Therefore, I do not quite understand the concern or interest of some, when we know that there are absorption problems, that infrastructure is lacking and that high speed, that is, a railway, is not supported. But not even the European Parliament is helping to make it a railway of special interest to tourists. Furthermore, there are environmental conditions in Germany and Austria that prevent or hinder the Danube from being navigable. Faced with so many complex situations, I understand that the macro-region that Mrs. Crețu told us about is an extraordinary region for tourism. And therefore we have to accept that a part of the national plan has roads, and we also have to recognize that our fourth rail package, with public services, is not helping much to make the rail run better either.

Also, I want to point out a local problem that means nothing globally, but means a lot for Istria, where the Istrian branch of Croatian railways has a connection only with Slovenia and there should be resolved or build a railway tunnel through Učka or make an agreement with Slovenian railways.

Because, specifically, for example, there are significant ports in the Adriatic Sea, significant capacities that could improve the transport of goods from the southern part of Europe to Central and Eastern Europe in contributing to the reduction of CO2 emissions. However, this network does not really exist on the map of the European Union. There are no such freight corridors for trains. So, what I am appealing to is that real and meaning new corridors for freight transport of trains are being drawn in these two macro-regions. Since from the current investments planned for 2014-2020 we do not really see where exactly this could be financed, to use funds from the Connecting Europe fund to build these freight corridors. Also, to reallocate funds that will enable the support of transport and environmental policy of the European Union in the period 2014-2020. because otherwise we will not reach the goals of 2030, neither in transport policy, nor in climate policy. What I would also emphasize as important is that, especially in countries that use cohesion funds, the absorption of the use of these cohesion funds for the development of railway infrastructure needs to be improved. Not only for the development of railway infrastructure, but also for the maintenance of especially cross-border infrastructure when it comes to regional connections, because it is very important that everything comes to life together.

I invite the Commissioner to travel along the Adriatic ridge by train to see with her eyes whether or not it is necessary to ensure that this connectivity deficit is closed as soon as possible. As will be recalled, on 28 October the Parliament made a clear statement, with the Jakovčić report on EUSAIR, on this need, asking to extend the TEN-T network to the entire Adriatic ridge, starting from Ancona, passing through Pescara, up to Bari and Brindisi. The Commission prefers to invest resources on the costly and controversial Turin-Lyon line and completely neglects the areas of Southern Europe, which are almost devoid of railway infrastructures and which instead would need more investments precisely to bridge the gap that exists the rest of Europe. Then show that there is really a real interest on the part of the European institutions for all regions, even those of the South.

The Danube and Adriatic macro-regions are important mechanisms for gathering synergies in these regions. This is particularly important in the field of transport and, in particular, rail transport. In the area of ​​these macro-regions, extremely important TEN-T routes pass through, but the existing transport networks are fragmented and mostly concentrated in the territory of one country or region. It would be necessary to expand cross-border rail lines, better coordinate timetables and modernize equipment. The system of macro-regions can be an excellent help in this. However, it is also important to note that these macro-regions also include countries that are not yet full members of the EU. Thanks to the Vienna talks last summer, the TEN-T network has been extended beyond the EU to include candidate countries. In this way, a map of Europe covering the whole continent has finally been drawn. This could also improve the competitiveness of the Danube and Adriatic macro-regions and reduce their isolation from other parts of Europe. However, in order for the positive transport logistics and economic effects to be realized uniformly along the entire length of the transport corridors and for the so-called corridor effect to emerge, the financing mechanisms provided by the EU need to be reconsidered. Due to the different legal and financial status of the candidate countries, the synergistic effect of macro-regions cannot be fully realized and bottlenecks remain with all goodwill. I would therefore encourage the Commission to create the appropriate legal and financial framework for better involvement of the candidate countries in the review of the TEN-T corridors.

Without any doubt, the rail sector in Romania faces a number of challenges and requires prompt and thorough reform. I believe that Romania’s General Transport Master Plan makes a significant effort in the sense of allocating up to EUR 14 billion for the next year to rail infrastructure investments, mostly to the rehabilitation and upgrading of around 4 000 km of railway lines. The reduction of approximately 30% of the network that is stipulated in the Plan has been identified ever since 1990 by the EBRD and the World Bank, and now it represents only 2% of freight traffic and 8% of passenger traffic. Maintaining the whole existing rail network to EU standards would indeed be unaffordable, and the reduction will optimise efficiency and decrease operational costs. Also, this network has to be preserved because the future is railway transportation – and everybody mentioned this. We need to keep in mind that in the current situation of the Romanian rail network the efforts to maintain and upgrade it will absorb all necessary funds, despite the fact that Romania increased public funding for transport infrastructure for 2014-2020 to a yearly average of 2% from the previous 1.15%. Let me point out as well that Romania will not give up the rail infrastructure upgraded or rebuilt with EU cofinancing, emphasising once again the fact, that compared to the European average, the same number of passengers could, theoretically speaking, be transported by using a 20-30% smaller network.

This lively debate once again reflects the importance and need for quality rail connections for the strategies of the Danube and the Adriatic-Ionian basin, as well as for the internal market. I would like to make a few clarifications. First of all, in relation to macro-regions, you know very well that they started on the condition that there are no new institutions, new legislation and additional money. So, in practice, these regions are putting all their resources together to meet common challenges that do not stop at state borders. The Commission has a coordinating role, but the programs and projects must come from the regions and Member States involved. Neither we, from Brussels, nor you, from here, from Strasbourg, can develop projects. Joint projects are very important. I am a strong supporter of these macro-regions, because, first of all, as you have pointed out, I am bringing together Member States of the European Union with states that are not members of the European Union and, for the time being, these are the only tools it brings together member countries and non-member countries of the European Union and responds to common challenges. For example, the Danube Strategy covers fourteen countries: nine Member States and five non-member states. As I said, the Commission does consider that the railway infrastructure in this region is inefficient and, in many cases, even lacking. I share your opinion. I was in Sarajevo. I have to go back to Vienna or Brussels so I can go to Sarajevo from Bucharest, but I still hope to come to Romania. Indeed, infrastructure is lacking, especially in terms of cross-border connectivity. Unfortunately, the national authorities do not always give priority to this and the action plan for the Danube region calls on the Member States - I also use this opportunity to renew this call - to strengthen transport infrastructure and extend public transport lines at the border. I think this is very important, especially in rural areas, given that the population in this region, in rural areas, is much higher than in other parts of the European Union. Regarding the question on river transport, which also refers to the Danube strategy: we discussed this topic at length in Ulm, where the annual conference on the Danube strategy took place. I think it is very important to emphasize that connectivity, in general, and the railway, as well as river transport are main priorities in the Danube strategy, but also in the Adriatic-Ionian. For example, I personally had a mediation role, to put together the transport ministers of Romania and Bulgaria. The worst navigability problems are in this area, due to the low level of the Danube at some times of the year and we tried to mediate, to bring the two ministers together, because it is enough that one meter does not it can sail between Romania and Bulgaria, and then the whole chain, from Germany to the Black Sea (practically all activities), is blocked. So, from this point of view, I hope that the two countries will take an important step to solve this airworthiness problem. As for the Adriatic-Ionian region, it covers eight states: four Member States and four non-member states of the European Union. I will be happy to launch this strategy in Dubrovnik in May. The railway services in this region are, of course, in a better condition than those in the Danube region. They can improve and become more competitive. There are rehabilitation projects within the Adriatic-Ionian macro-region, and the necessary efforts and investments it really needs to approach normal TEN-T standards. We must also take into account the fact that, unfortunately, statistics show that passenger traffic is declining, especially in terms of navigability on rivers. I would like to point out two more things. There are two key issues: on the one hand, we need everyone to be prepared to actively cooperate, as I said, across borders, establishing close links with neighboring countries and regions. On the other hand, we need strong political will to carry out the necessary reforms and thus facilitate the critical mass of investment that will allow public railway services to meet the needs of the population. Therefore, from our point of view, we now have all the tools in place and, of course, I would like to take this opportunity to encourage all stakeholders to use them optimally, to enhance the role of public railway services in these regions. The Commission wants to work with the European Parliament to make progress on these issues for the benefit of citizens, the business community and, implicitly, the European Union as a whole. I'm sorry the lady left. I was disturbed by this reference to the European Commission's indifference to southern Europe. I, personally, have been to Italy twice. We unlocked operational programs that were blocked, especially in Campania, Sicily, Calabria. When I took over as European Commissioner, all the analyzes showed that these operational programs could not be unblocked, and I succeeded. In Naples, together with Minister Delrio, we launched the new Bari-Naples railway line and we hope that, during our term, we will be able to inaugurate it. I was very happy that in this way Italy can be linked not only from north to south, but also horizontally, and I think that is a very important thing. I would not like to enter into this controversy related to Romania. I just want to say that the Commission does not choose the priorities and railway lines introduced in the national strategies, because the transport master plans represent the national strategies. Whether it is Romania or Italy, the European Commission provides support through our services, through ongoing consultations throughout the stages of developing master plans, but at the same time, of course, there is the right of governments to determine what these priorities are. My hope is that, during their implementation, national governments will have the necessary flexibility to meet the needs of their citizens, as needed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1264, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate was closed.Written declarations (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1265, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Benedek JÁVOR", "mepid": "124721", "text": "in writing. - The Adriatic-Danube macro-region has significant European transit routes, so the development of environmentally friendly transport routes is a priority, but care must be taken to ensure that this objective does not overshadow the priority aspects of nature conservation.

Commissioner, dear colleagues! 126 million dogs and cats are kept as pets in the European Union. You can choose from an infinite number of dogs and cats on the Internet, and pedigree puppies are offered at bargain prices at markets. These animals are illegally produced under unspeakable conditions. The parent animals are exposed to a true martyrdom - a ruthless, cruel exploitation of helpless creatures. Behind this is a mafia of illegal traders - we are dealing with organized crime! The illegal trade in dogs and cats is the third largest source of income after the organized drug and arms trade. The puppies are weaned far too early and are not vaccinated. Chip numbers and pet ID cards are forged. Many puppies are seriously ill, they suffer, and very many die after a short time. That is excruciating - also for the owner, by the way. Often they are communicable diseases. These puppies therefore represent a major threat to the health of other animals, but also to human health. The CALISTO study financed by the Commission also comes to this conclusion. Pets are carriers of more than 100 zoonoses and 70% of all new diseases in humans are due to animal diseases. In short, the problem of the illegal trade in dogs and cats goes well beyond the issue of animal welfare. It concerns public health, consumer protection and the fight against organized crime. Our legislation is not working properly. Not even after the revision of the pet travel scheme in 2013. It is far too easy to give animals a false identity. We asked the Commission to conduct a study on the welfare of commercially traded cats and dogs. Health risks should also be recorded. The possible establishment of EU-wide compatible systems for the registration of pets was discussed. Although the study has not yet been published - for whatever reason - the Commission presented the first results at a conference three months ago. In doing so, she confirmed that greater harmonization of the identification and registration systems of pets is necessary. Commissioner, I think it would be nice if you would listen! Because we urgently need these systems across the entire EU - time is of the essence. Some Member States already have such systems; harmonization is feasible and we have had something like that in other areas too - a technical question. There would finally be clarity about the actual age and vaccination status of animals, and the Commission can regulate this under the regulation on communicable animal diseases. It can present a delegated act that regulates this EU-wide identification and registration of dogs and cats. And it would also give the Member States, the regions and the cities the opportunity to hold irresponsible livestock owners accountable for simply throwing their animals on the street when they are tired of them. Because these animals suffer on the street or they cause unbelievable costs in animal shelters, and that can also be avoided. And this seems like the only way to stop the puppy mafia.

Our constituents are concerned about the growing illegal pet trade in Europe and they want us to take action. Thousands of animals – as the previous speaker has just said – have been traded illegally for profit each year, in spite of the existing European Pet Travel Scheme. This is costing millions of euros and the welfare of thousands of animals. They are bred purely to make money; they are born in inhumane circumstances on an industrial scale; they are poorly cared for and exposed to disease; there is no record of where they were born, or when they were born; no record of where they travelled through, or whether they have had the appropriate vaccinations. Any documents used are frequently falsified under the current pet scheme. Owners are unwittingly funding a disgusting industry, unaware of the level of care their pet may need. The Commission’s own investigation into dogs and cats concludes that lack of harmonisation in identification and registration systems across the Member States is a key area for attention, in order to end this illegal trade. To close the loopholes in the existing pet scheme, we need to ensure that pets have a person responsible for them at all times, whether that person be the owner, the breeder, or the shelter. This will enable us to keep track of origin, age, vaccinations and the animal’s welfare. The responsible person should then register these details with a competent overseer in the Member State. Should the pet then live in a different Member State, the competent authority there should be able to access its previous details.

Mahatma Gandhi said that civilization's development and moral progress can be judged by the way it treats its animals. Today's debate shows that the protection of animals is at the heart of our European civilization, especially animals that are closest to humans, domesticated, and whose survival depends on humans. Dogs and cats have a special place in our European civilization and culture as animals whose relationship with humans results mainly not from their economic utility, but from their special attachment to humans and their special friendship with humans. Many of these animals live in our homes, but many are experiencing the drama of abandonment. We have the problem of homelessness of animals in Europe, especially dogs, which, unfortunately, often experience cruel treatment. Animals suffer, but so do people who witness this suffering mentally. Recently - I have to mention this also because of the presence of the Commissioner from Romania - we have a problem with the dramatic situation in Romania. Citizens of this country, people of good will, moved by the fate of animals, turn to me. In this country there is a problem of very brutal treatment of homeless dogs, which is the subject of many complaints from people who perceive this brutality not only as contrary to the principles of animal protection, but also contrary to the protection of human rights. I hope and appeal to the Romanian authorities - especially as chairman of the Animal Protection Intergroup of over 100 Members in the European Parliament - to urgently put an end to this brutality that does not conform to civilized European principles. The image of a beautiful country and brave Romanian nation loses much of it. Improving the fate of homeless animals is an important challenge for us, not only for animal welfare, but also for the well-being of people, because a sensitive person cannot feel happy when he sees the suffering of animals around him. Registration and identification is a way to increase the responsibility of owners and prevent abandonment of animals, it is a way to control the fate of these animals. There are many identification systems in the Member States, but they are not enough, so we should start thinking about an EU identification system. Ladies and gentlemen! Animal protection is a European value under Article 13 of the Treaty and we should keep this in mind. And when it comes to companion animals, such as dogs and cats, their protection should be a European task, with the possibility of using funds from the European Union budget for this purpose. Such funds should be envisaged, especially for humanitarian reduction of the population of homeless animals, for sterilization, adoption, shelter management, and for the identification system.

I agree with what has been pointed out: that illegal trade in pets is a serious public health risk. It is not just about the spread of diseases such as rabies but also about antibiotic resistance. I also agree with those who say that illegal trade is a significant source of income for the mafia in Europe. That's also true, it's true. It is obvious that many Member States today have shortcomings in the control of their pets. Stricter rules for a database registration would reduce this problem, but all this must be done at Member State level. A European database would have no added value at all, it would cost more than it creates and it is very unclear who will create it? Who will update it? And how should it be done at all? Excuse me for saying that, but we are not even capable of registering all the refugees entering Europe. And now some want us to try to register all the cats and dogs that exist in Europe. It is impossible to do, simply impossible. It is this type of task that the EU should absolutely not do. The new EU Animal Health Act, for which I have taken over responsibility, will soon be finally adopted by the European Parliament. It allows the Commission to require countries to establish national databases for dogs and cats. So what you demand already exists. The new law also means more measures and registration requirements to get rid of the illegal trade that we have heard about and that was talked about here; the problem of stray dogs.

I would also like to turn to my colleague who just spoke again. I ask myself why the sex life of cats is difficult to register in Europe, but better nationally. I don't really understand that either. Overall, we need the national registers, which must be compatible, which must be networked with one another. That is the reason why we are also having the discussion today and what we would actually like to bring together. I would like to thank everyone who also put this topic on the agenda. I admit that just a few years ago, before the last European elections, I completely underestimated the dimensions of the pet trade here in Europe. In the course of the discussion that there has been that many people have expressed themselves moved about what happened to the street dogs in Romania and also to the street dog trade, especially from Romania, I already realized that we are here have to do more. At the time, I also committed myself to supporting every initiative that resulted in our joint European commitment to this. What I understand is that the national rules for pets are also very different in the Member States. Some are very strictly organized, others less so and in other Member States they are absent. So on the one hand it is necessary to make a recommendation to the member states to set up the databases according to common criteria and then of course to enable this networking. I fully agree, if we emphasize that this can also be an effective contribution to counteracting the health risks caused by stray animals, sick animals, and animals that have not been socialized. And I also agree with everyone who points out that there is also a particular risk that dogs or cats, their history, their socialization, their illnesses are not actually known to come into families and these families are then overwhelmed after a short time and then there is a risk that the animals will be abandoned or simply left to the animal shelter. I think we have a shared responsibility here. I heard the number that an estimated 700,000 puppies are being trafficked illegally. Many of us know people from our neighborhood, from our circle of acquaintances, who have bought dogs from which we do not know how they actually got them or where they came from, and who then have to see what happens next. In principle, 150,000 animals are said to have died as a result of this illegal trade. You said earlier, Mrs Crețu: we need to do an impact assessment. For me, however, the first question that we have to ask ourselves is: if there is the study that Mrs Sommer spoke of, which has not yet been published, but which the Commission has already reported on, and if there are specific statements there, what It means that if we do not carry out this registration, then that is a large part of what would actually have to be done in the context of an impact assessment. So I ask you: Take our wish from Parliament that we can find a European solution here together, that we do something here for animal welfare, but also to ensure that these mafia methods can finally be stopped.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1280, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Keith TAYLOR", "mepid": "102931", "text": "on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, I have two questions for the Commissioner to consider.

Does the Commissioner agree that this highlights the degree to which this trade is criminal and represents cross-border organised crime, tax evasion and fraud?  Secondly, correctly identifying the age of a puppy or a kitten as meeting the legal requirement of 15 weeks is almost impossible at present. Unless there is a mandatory registration within the first few weeks of birth, does the Commissioner agree there will be continuing difficulty in establishing animals’ exact ages?

However, I do not accept – and will never accept – that this justifies centralisation or a vast new bureaucracy. English is a wonderful language of vivid metaphor, and two phrases come to mind which perfectly describe what the EU does all the time. Firstly, using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. So often, massively over—engineered, highly technical solutions are produced to solve real problems, but ones which do not require monstrous bureaucratic apparatus backed by draconian laws and sentences, which are then enforced selectively – or perhaps not at all – in some Member States.

The Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council of 2003 on the movement of pet animals specifies several requirements that each breeder must meet in order for his animal to be able to move across the European Union, ie. the animal must have a tattoo or be pinned, so it must be identified and must have a passport and a vaccination certificate. I believe that if the individual registration systems for pets in the various Member States were to be unified, it would help and make the current practice much more effective than if each Member State had its own system. It has already been mentioned here that these systems need to be compatible in order for this data to be interoperable. I am convinced that there is no need to build a new building and a new office, it is just a matter of interconnecting these systems.

This means that ethical standards do not apply, laws do not apply, puppies are exported to Western Europe and therefore it is a problem of the whole European Union. It is not just a problem of the Czech Republic, but where cross-border trade is, moreover, illegal and unethical, there must, in my opinion, be intervened by the European Union. If you intervene, I am convinced that even for many Czechs who today view the European Union negatively or look at it as a body that is addressing their interests somewhere in Brussels, you will do something positive, you will do something for their animals.

Even if this seems to go in the direction of animal welfare, I would remain vigilant on the harmonization of policies.This is why I would follow this file closely because the harmonization of standards would also allow a reduction in cruelties in animal farms. puppies and health risks for humans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1294, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Emil RADEV", "mepid": "124850", "text": "In written form. - There is currently no common European legislation defining a uniform system for the identification and registration of domestic animals such as dogs and cats, and each country determines the ways and means to do so. The individual national systems where they exist are also not linked, leading to a fragmented environment with incomplete or completely missing information on the status of the animals. In the presence of a common market for goods and services, free movement of people and labor mobility, the existence of a pan-European registration system is essential. It would save a lot of time and money, limit the bureaucracy of moving an animal to another country and last but not least - it would give owners much more certainty about the origin of their pets. Not to mention, of course, the benefits of disease control and the spread of infections among animals and humans, as well as the reduction of trafficking and abuse in the sale of dogs and cats. Having a unified identification and registration system would also encourage responsible animal husbandry, as disposing of them on the street will no longer be so easy and owners will be able to be quickly detected and sanctioned, which in turn will reduce the population of stray dogs and cats.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1295, "date": "2016-02-04.json", "name": "Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI", "mepid": "28314", "text": "I declare adjourned the session of the European Parliament.(The sitting was closed at 4.45 pm)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}]
