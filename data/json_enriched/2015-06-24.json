Honourable Members, Before turning to the agenda, I would like to note that this is the last plenary session of the European Parliament during the Latvian Presidency. It falls on a day when my country celebrates a very important holiday, a real folk holiday— Lio or the summer solstice. In honor of this celebration and the fact that this is the final plenary session of our Presidency, I will speak in Latvian today.  The Latvian Presidency concludes its participation in the European Parliament plenary session with this very important debate on the preparation of the European Council, the most important event for the European Semester.  The forthcoming Agenda of the European Council is very saturated. The Heads of State or Government of the European Union will discuss migration, security and economic issues. However, before I address these issues, I would like to brief you on the informal meeting of the Heads of State and Government of the euro area on Monday, which was convened at the initiative of the President of the European Council, Mr Tusk. Its aim was to dispel the dangerous ambiguity with regard to Greece. The Heads of State or Government of the Eurogroup exchanged views on the situation in Greece and discussed the progress of negotiations between Greece and international lenders. With this meeting, President Tusk wanted to change the dynamics of the negotiations so far, giving them a new positive momentum. Monday's meeting did indeed give a positive boost. As President Tusk has already pointed out, according to the initial assessment of international lenders, the new proposals by the Greek Government are a positive step in the right direction. At the moment, it is important not to dwell on action. Prime Minister Cipr and international lenders are already working to achieve results at tonight's eurogroup meeting by concluding work on elements of the Greek reform plan that will be presented to the Heads of State and Government tomorrow.  Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. Returning to the European Council's agenda, I would like to begin with the issue of migration. This will undoubtedly be one of the most important items on the agenda of tomorrow's European Council.  As we all know very well, already in April 2015 the European Council decided on emergency measures to prevent further deaths at sea and to find new ways to address smugglers. Many - including the European Parliament - felt that the outcome of the April European Council was insufficient. I will immediately say that the role of the April European Council was not, and could not, be, an immediate resolution of all the problems in the area of migration. There are no quick solutions in this very difficult situation. A sustainable solution can only be possible within the framework of a targeted, comprehensive and balanced approach, which is systematically implemented step by step. Tomorrow's European Council discussion will be another step towards implementing such an approach.  In the few months that have passed since the April European Council, the Council and the Commission have made a valuable contribution to finding a solution. The Presidency, together with the European Commission and the European External Action Service, presented to the President of the European Council a renewed action plan for the implementation decided by the April European Council.  The Commission, as we know, has also published its communication on the European Agenda on Migration. The Council has immediately started to work on the various aspects of the Communication, as well as on the Commission's concrete proposals for the implementation of the measures contained in the European Agenda on Migration. Tomorrow, the European Council will focus on three important elements of this policy: (1) relocation, resettlement, reintegration, (2) return, readmission and (3) cooperation with countries of origin and transit.  These elements are closely interlinked and their effective implementation will best protect those in need. However, safeguards in themselves will not be sufficient. They must go hand in hand with an effective system for returning irregular migrants. It is no secret that the most recent discussions in the Council have now been the result of the Commission's proposal to relocate asylum seekers between the Member States of the European Union. Yesterday's General Affairs Council debate confirmed the unanimity of a common European Union response to the challenge of migration. A balance must be found between solidarity and responsibility, which are an essential part of the European Union's migration policy.  Ministers also expressed their willingness to show solidarity and to find a solution to this emergency caused by migration flows. There is a common understanding that there is a need for an appropriate mechanism to allow an adequate response to this emergency situation and to support the so-called frontline Member States.  However, before that, a number of very important political and technical issues will have to be resolved. Member States differ in the views of the Member States, which exactly the European Union's response should be and how it will refer to each individual EU Member State. This is therefore all the more necessary for the involvement of the European Council and guidance to decisions to take into the future. The issue of migration is very complex and politically sensitive. This requires a smart and balanced approach and does not take solutions \"on a fast hand\".  What is worrying is the information that has been made today that Hungary is unilaterally planning to suspend the Dublin system. Unilateral action by individual Member States is not an option; only in dialogue and joint action, through the consistent implementation of the existing package, it is possible to respond to the existing challenges.  Therefore, as I said, it is precisely a comprehensive approach that is consistently put into practice and thus provides the necessary support for the short and sustainable solution in the future. It is already clear that the challenges of migration will be at the forefront of our common agenda for a long time and intensive work will continue even after the European Council.  Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. The next item on the agenda of the European Council is the security challenges. The European Union's internal and external security has faced very high challenges over the last year. Europe and the world have undergone dramatic changes, so we are now living in a very different geopolitical situation. The European Council will look at the work being done on internal security and it should be noted that, during the Latvian Presidency, the Council has indeed done a great deal to strengthen security in the European Union. It should be noted that on 16 June the Council approved the renewed Internal Security Strategy of the European Union, which also took into account the european Parliament's contribution. We have made progress on a number of issues, such as a significant increase in the exchange of information between the competent authorities of the Member States, and from 1 July the European Union's internet reporting unit will become operational.  At the same time, however, we must continue to work towards intensified checks at the External Borders of the European Union. The Passenger Name Record Directive should also be agreed before the end of the year. The Council therefore calls on the European Parliament to confirm its position so that we have the opportunity to continue working together when we start a trialogue. As in the area of migration, the Presidency, in cooperation with the European External Action Service, has prepared and will present to the President of the European Council an overview of the progress made in the fight against terrorism.  On the other hand, on the external aspects of security, the European Council will discuss security and defence policy and will assess the progress made in this area since the European Council conclusions of December 2013. This discussion will take place in a situation where there is a new and significantly different internal and external security environment with new types of security challenges.  In this context, it is important to note that the Council has agreed on the launch of the Common Security and Defence Policy Operation (EUNAVFOR MED) in the Mediterranean. At the same time, the European Union needs a new strategy, which the European Council will ask the High Representative to prepare. The Presidency also particularly welcomes the action plan on strategic communication prepared under the leadership of the High Representative. This is an important step in coordinating and strengthening the European Union's capacity to resist disinformation campaigns by third parties. Yesterday, ministers continued discussions in the General Affairs Council on the possibilities of further strengthening the European Union's strategic communication. The new security challenges have also made it clear that the European Union must strengthen its capabilities against hybrid threats. I therefore welcome the decision of the Foreign Affairs Council of 18 May to draw up proposals for the European Union to combat hybrid threats by the end of 2015. We also expect the European Council to stress the need to mobilise European Union instruments to help better counter the hybrid threat. As a Presidency, we welcomed the plan to keep security and defence policy issues on the European Council's agenda on a regular basis. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. Of course, economic issues will also be on the agenda of this European Council. The European Union's growth figures show that the economic recovery has stabilised in the EU Member States. The EU economy is expected to grow by 1.8% this year and accelerate to 2.1% next year. Unemployment continues to fall. Both external factors and policy measures have contributed to a positive turnaround. This encourages, but growth rates are low, and there is really a lot of work to be done to ensure that economic growth is long-term and sustainable.  The three priorities of the annual cycle of economic policy coordination, or European semester, have just been: firstly, to encourage investment, secondly, to implement structural reforms and, thirdly, to develop responsible fiscal policies. In line with these priorities, recommendations have been made to each Member State of the European Union and the euro area as a whole, which were adopted yesterday by the General Affairs Council and will be approved by the European Council tomorrow. (The speaker indicated that there were problems with interpretation and expressed the hope that they would be resolved.)  Continuing on the economy, it should be stressed that ...  (Technical the speaker interrupted the speech due to problems.)  In the area of economic governance, one priority for the Presidency was to ensure the success of the European Semester in its new, improved form.  (Due to technical problems, the speaker interrupted the speech.)  Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. As I said, one of the priorities of the Presidency in the area of economic governance was to ensure the success of the European Semester in its new, improved form. The early publication of national analyses and greater attention to country-specific recommendations has a positive impact on the sense of responsibility at national level. This, in turn, contributes to the implementation of structural reforms. These reforms are essential for improving Europe's competitiveness and for boosting our economic recovery. The Latvian Presidency has laid good foundations for regular discussions on the most important structural reforms that are currently in place and in the near future. The Council has also done a great deal to create the conditions for long-term and sustainable economic growth.  I will give only three examples. Firstly, we have managed to reach an agreement on the European Fund for Strategic Investments in record time. I would like to sincerely thank the European Parliament and the European Commission for their intensive work, which I hope will culminate in a positive vote by the European Parliament tonight. Secondly, the Council has focused much in developing the potential of the European Union's single market this month, including through a detailed discussion of obstacles and priorities for the development of the Digital Single Market.  We all know that without reassuring our society to the digital age, we will lose in all areas – employment, growth, competitiveness. The importance of digital technologies for innovation, economic growth and job creation was also particularly noted yesterday by ministers at the General Affairs Council. That is why, in the light of the Commission's Digital Single Market strategy, the European Council intends to set priorities for further work. This work will affect a wider area and not just barriers to a well-functioning digital single market. We expect the European Council to provide further impetus to work on the approval of the legislation essential to the completion of the Digital Single Market. The Latvian Presidency has made every effort to ensure the progress of the Data Protection Regulation, the Telecommunications Single Market and the Network and Information Security Directive.  Finally, when it comes to the economy, the European Council will focus on the development of Europe's economic and monetary union.  On 22 June, a report by five presidents on the development of Europe's economic and monetary union was published. The President of the European Parliament has also participated in its development, as we know.  The European Council provides for the first exchange of views on the five Presidents' report and will continue to work on the issues outlined in the report in all relevant Council formats. The report makes a number of recommendations for better management of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which will be examined by the European Heads of State and Government at the June European Council. I don't want to judge their assessment too early. In my opinion, the report contains ideas to gradually make economic and monetary union more effective in the short term and also to complete this structure in the longer term.  I would like to stress that every effort must be made to promote convergence. The differences between euro area Member States may jeopardise the future and economic development of the Union as a whole. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. As we can see, the agenda of the forthcoming European Council is saturated with a great many topical and important issues. I would like to hear your comments and opinions and I expect an interesting and intense discussion.

Mr President, Madam Secretary of State, ladies and gentlemen.  When President Juncker addressed this Parliament on 15 July last year, he told you that his primary mission is to rebuild bridges in Europe. In fact, building bridges in Europe, and beyond Europe, is an eminently European task and that is why it is not here today. He would have wanted to be here, among you, now, but he is trying to build bridges with Greece right now.  This is what we have done all these last months, in recent days with Greece: build bridges! Because the European Union is not meant to exclude, but to include, and in Europe, everything is about a permanent dialogue that must be based on understanding and mutual respect. It's not always easy, it's not a long, quiet river, but you get there when everyone is ready to build their own part of the bridge. And we have to find an agreement this week on Greece. Time is running out and we have to get straight to the point. There is no extension. It is imperative to meet the expectations of the suffering Greeks. They are the ones the Commission and President Juncker are thinking about. It is for them that we work, to help them fight unemployment and social insecurity and to build their future on a sound and solid foundation. This means that we must all take responsibility: the Greek government, the Eurogroup, the IMF, the European Parliament and the European Commission.  We must all commit ourselves to a fresh start for jobs, growth and investment through the reforms it will implement, but also through the European Funds.  As soon as all the necessary conditions for an agreement are met, the Commission is ready to activate or rather, reactivate, 35 billion euros of the European budget to support Greece.  President Juncker will propose solutions to facilitate the absorption of the European Structural and Investment Funds and immediately mobilise large sums of money to start investment projects in the real economy.  It is only after joint efforts that we will find an agreement acceptable to all, and we are convinced that this will be the case at the end of the European Council over the next two days.  Building bridges is once again what we must devote our efforts to throughout this European Council. First of all, of course, on the issue of immigration, the Council has mentioned, because if there is one area in which European solidarity can manifest itself, it is immigration.  I attended the Council yesterday and we are sometimes surprised by the ease with which some Member States ask for solidarity, and by their silence when they are asked for solidarity.  We all agree that there is an urgent need to respond to the migration and humanitarian crisis facing all our countries. We have to do it one way or another, because everyone will be confronted with it sooner or later. Having said that, and it is good to have said so, the urgency now is to agree on what needs to be done, so that European solidarity is not a vain word, or a tear to be shed with every tragedy in the Mediterranean, and Europe remains true to its values and interests. The minute's silence at the European Council should not be followed by months of silence when answers are needed. (Applause) What we need to do is reach out to those unfortunates who, at the risk of their lives, leave their conflict-torn country in search of international protection to which they are entitled. It is a matter of respect for human dignity.  We must also express our solidarity with the Member States which are facing a high migratory pressure. Today it is Italy and Greece. Tomorrow it could be other countries.  In any case, solidarity mechanisms are needed, and it is now that we must put them in place, acting together and not against each other. It's now, not tomorrow, because people are still dying in the Mediterranean.  Let us be clear, we are not talking about quotas when we are talking about human beings. It's a misunderstanding. We are talking about a redistribution key and we are not talking about quotas on the right to asylum. We all have an obligation to stand in solidarity. President Juncker will therefore strongly defend the Commission's proposals on relocation and resettlement, because these proposals are necessary and ensure a good balance between solidarity and responsibility. No Member State has presented us with better solutions. (Applause) We are told has said several times, \"We don't want that,\" but we have not been offered any other solution. And I stress, the division between Member States must be done on an effective basis, because experience has shown us that if it is voluntary, it does not work.  We will therefore have to agree, by the end of July, on the practical modalities of a solidarity and equitable distribution between the Member States in order to implement these measures as soon as possible.  The cost of our inaction today would be just as great for migrants as it would be for Europe, where solidarity must be shared. We have to take this step together. To do nothing now would be to deny our values, the values to which we are strongly attached. (Applause) We know very well that some countries have opt-ins, others opt out, but Europe is all the more credible when it supports those who are most vulnerable and when it acts united and united. And I am pleased that Ireland, but also Norway, Switzerland and Liechtenstein have made known their intention to participate in this relocation mechanism. We invite other countries to follow their example. On the other hand, if we are to be generous to those in need of international protection, we must be firm towards those who have no reason to stay in Europe, nor any need for international protection. That is why we have put forward proposals to strengthen our return and readmission policies. It is clear that our people's support for a human asylum policy decreases when people feel that those who are not entitled to asylum are abusing that asylum to stay anyway. We really need to look at this issue on both sides. And since it is not enough to combat the symptoms of the crisis, we must also strengthen our cooperation with the countries of origin and transit to address the causes of the crisis. We are well aware of these causes. These are instability, war and poverty in Libya, Syria, Iraq and across Africa. Here, too, we need to build bridges and develop more shared responsibilities and cooperation with our African partners. Member States must increase their development aid at all costs. It's a must. We need 0.7% now, not tomorrow, not next year, but now! In terms of defence, from Ukraine to Syria, through the Middle East and North Africa, our neighbourhood is increasingly fragile and unstable. One would have to be naïve to think that Europe could only be a soft power. There can be no durable soft power without hard power, without built-in defense capabilities. Again, it is a question of credibility. It is not a question of building a European army overnight. It is an old European project, a long-term project. Nor is it a question of making the European Union a counter-project to NATO. We are not competitors, but partners, we must work together and be in sync.  What we need in the area of defence is enhanced cooperation, as the Lisbon Treaty provides. We need to do more together and refrain from taking separate and divided initiatives at the national level.  Today, in the European Union, more than 80% of investment in defence equipment is spent at the national level. So, if only for budgetary reasons, there is also a need to build bridges and cooperate more in defence markets, in research and innovation to meet common needs and challenges.  Finally, we must build bridges to the future and achieve economic and monetary union while preserving the integrity of the single market.  The crisis has shown us that the euro protects us. He brought us monetary stability. Without the euro, we would have had very unpleasant moments of unwinding of national selfishness. But the protective virtues of the euro do not fall from the sky: they are directly linked to our ability to implement policies focused on stability, on balanced economic growth, on a competitive social market economy in the service of full employment, social progress and prosperity of citizens. This is precisely the objective of the report's proposals - I see that the English interpretation is working well - that has become that of the five presidents, since President Juncker was also keen to involve President Schulz in it.  The report includes a roadmap for achieving economic and monetary union, which is ambitious and nevertheless pragmatic. Some of the proposed initiatives can and should be be put in place without delay. The first measures should be launched by the institutions as early as 1 July 2015; others require more time. Above all, this report offers a clear direction, essential for citizens and economic actors and for confidence in the single currency. The first phase, or deepening through practice, begins today until June 2017. It builds on existing instruments and existing treaties to boost competitiveness and convergence, ensure responsible fiscal policies, complete financial union and strengthen the democratic accountability of economic and monetary union. The second phase of the completion of the economic and monetary union will allow us to take greater action to make the convergence process more binding and create a euro area treasure. The final phase by 2015 will provide a stable and prosperous framework for all EU Member States that have adopted the single currency and an attractive environment for others.  To build intelligently and serenely in stages, as we propose, an economic union, a financial union, a fiscal union and a political union, is not an end in itself, but a means of meeting the expectations of the citizens and preparing the Union for future global challenges. Because Europe is more than the single market and the single currency, Europe, it is a broad, vast and ambitious project for its citizens, but not just for its citizens.

I would like to confine myself today to two points which are certainly being discussed at the forefront of the Council and which are the ones that are most perplexing and moving us all. One is firstly our eurozone, our currency in the European Union, and above all, of course, Greece. The European People's Party wants Greece to stay in the euro. We feel that the situation is serious these days, that difficult decisions need to be made. Jean-Claude Juncker, in particular, has the full support of his group for his negotiations, which he is now leading. I would also like to say that, whether we are experiencing the crisis we experienced with the economic and financial crisis five years ago, we Europeans can also be a little proud of what we have achieved in other countries. Portugal, Spain, Ireland and Cyprus are four countries that have been programme countries and have already left the programme behind, and are again on their own. Now this week Greece remains as a big question to be resolved. First of all, I would like to express frustration at the fact that an enormous amount of time has been wasted. We have now been discussing the matter at technical level for months, there has been talk, it has been shaded. Nothing has come out, we have wasted time without end because Greece – the new Greek Government – has not been able to put concrete proposals on the table. On Monday, thank God, we have at least received at least one text. After the first five months of a communist government, I think it is worth taking a look at what these new politicians have achieved, what has been moved. It was also said that they had taken over a broken country and would now dare to build it. I take a look at this balance sheet. In January, we had a situation where there was a slight surplus in Greece's state budget. Now this surplus has melted down, there is again a deficit in the budget. Pensions can no longer be paid at the end of the month. It was in January that we had slight growth. After years of very difficult and catastrophic economic development, we had slight growth in January. What do we have now? A severe recession: no one is investing in Greece anymore. We had banks that were reasonably stable. Today, Greek banks are facing a bank run. Billions are withdrawn almost every day because their own citizens no longer have confidence in the financial institutions there. The biggest promise was that the rich in Greece must finally pay. I think that, after five months, we can ask what has become of this promise. Can the rich finally be asked to pay? We have a communist government that has destroyed this country in recent months, and that must be said.  That is the record we are facing after five months of Tsipras. Nevertheless, we are trying, but negotiations are still taking place. As the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, conditionality is an important point for us, because Greece needs a plan to get out of this negative spiral that can be observed there. That is why we are calling for a programme on which the lenders agree, together with Greece, which, at the end of the day, also offers a perspective for Greece. I would like to say explicitly that the ball is in Athens. We need proposals from Athens on how to solve the problems. We will also need a parliamentary majority in Athens for this programme. Simple signatures from Tsipras and Varoufakis will no longer be enough to win the trust of Europeans. That is the situation we are in. You feel that many in our group are frustrated by the behaviour of our Greek partner. In spite of all this, we will support all efforts to keep Greece in the euro. We owe that to the people of Greece – not to the government, but to the people. Thousands have demonstrated on the streets of Athens over the last few days who want to stay in the euro and want the help of Europeans. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stand by these people. I would like to pick up on a second point, namely the migration issue, which has been discussed. We need legal routes for those who come to Europe, especially those who need our protection. The European Commission's proposal, particularly on the distribution of Syrian refugees, is a good proposal. A proposal that no one usually rejects Can. That is why we support the Commission to remain stubborn and to really demand help from the states for Syrian refugees – refugees defined by the UNHCR. However, on the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I also say that we must remember the figures and the abuses. Last year, two thirds of all applicants in the European Union were rejected. If we look at this, we must also make it clear that Europe must work to secure the external border better. Even on the external border of a continent, one can say: you are allowed in. And you can also say to someone who has no legal reason: you have to stay outside. From our point of view, it is not acceptable for refugees to come from countries that are candidates for EU membership with which we are negotiating, such as Serbia, for example. We need clarification that these are safe third countries. Incidentally, also in the case of Turkey, which should also take over the repatriation of rejected applicants. I also believe that, mr Vice-President, on the return policy, the Commission should talk more intensively with the African and Asian countries of origin, so that these return agreements can finally be concluded. We need a balanced proposal: aid on the one hand, demarcation from the extreme forces that we have in Europe, which, unfortunately, all foreigners are lumping together, and, on the other hand, proper border security and the fight against abuse.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you to the Latvian Presidency for its work. Today I sincerely wanted to comment on the final outcome of the negotiations on Greece, but we are still discussing 'if'.  I remember that in February it was said that agreement had been reached; in April the same thing was said. Last Monday, it seemed that agreement had finally been reached. I believe that this is the right time, but I still hear critical voices: members of the International Monetary Fund, some figures on the European right... And I am sorry that someone I hold in high regard, such as Mr Weber, still says today at 3 p.m. that the Greek Government still has to make proposals.  The agreement is there, it is on the table, and it has been achieved mainly thanks to the efforts of President Juncker and the European Commission, who must be given the opportunity to acknowledge that they have behaved with balance and responsibility. But if the deal is there, why wait? What should we wait for?  I dare not imagine... We would be ludicrous if, for some point of VAT on Greek catering, the integrity of the euro area and the future of Europe were to be jeopardised. What game are we playing? If anyone wants to stretch the time to humiliate the Greek people, we tell them that they are wrong.  The governments – and we are not in the Tsipras government – change with the citizens' vote. And now there is no question of the Tsipras government, nor of the judgment on the Tsipras government: the salvation of the Greek people and the salvation and integrity of the eurozone are now under discussion.  The exhausting continuation of technical discussions reveals the danger of a bureaucratic Europe without vision, including on immigration.  I would like to thank President Timmermans for making a robust, firm and vision-taking speech. But it is not the same in the Council. I must say this with great sincerity and also with great sadness.  On the one hand there are countries like Italy that are committed to doing everything possible to save lives in the Mediterranean, on the other there are governments such as the Hungarian government that unilaterally raise walls of protection against migrants. And I have to say that I am very sad that it is precisely a country like Hungary, which has suffered in its own skin from the Iron Curtain, that is building new walls against migrants.  The European Commission's strategy has been right and seems to be partly accepted by the Member States, only in part. Well the confirmation of the forty thousand migrants who will be welcomed in Europe. Well the establishment of hotspots. But that is not enough. I understand diplomacy, but we cannot reduce everything to an ambiguous lexical exercise.  I hear that some States are in favour of solidarity but are against compulsory mechanisms. What does that mean? I must explain to you what it means that they must not be compulsory mechanisms. Explain to me in concrete terms what that means. And do we want, faced with such a huge theme, to take refuge in the lexical exercise of a distinction of words? Or do we have to go into substance and show the attributes and show that we are up to being the leader of a Europe? If we are not the leader of a Europe... I say this to the governments.  Why do we get scared and complain about the populist drift? The populist drift is anti-European; is the result of a lack of attributes if Orbán does those things. If one state sets itself against another state, it is because there is no European decision. If there is and if there is a European vision, these things will end.  That is why the European Parliament has every right to make its voice heard. This House – despite some minorities that I respect, but whose position I do not share – has always expressed strong positions on this issue, which I would like to reiterate in my speech.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 10, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I would also like to thank the Latvian Presidency for their time in office. I know this is their last part-session. One of the problems holding back competitiveness in the EU is that, whatever the problem, the solutions proposed here seem to be more Europe and more regulation; and while we in the ECR campaign against red tape that holds back businesses from creating jobs, as we consider the issues to be discussed at the summit – Greece and the Mediterranean crisis – the solution seems to be not more red tape, but more sticking plaster, more Band-Aid. Consider the patient that is the Greek economy. Each time we approach another Greek crisis, rather than sticking to the medicine, we propose more sticking plaster. The solution is yet again more expensive sticking plaster in the form of a bailout, until the next Greek crisis when the solution is yet again more sticking plaster – bailout or restructuring – until the next Greek crisis, and so on. If and when we reach another deal, how long will it be before we are back here again in this Chamber debating the same issues? How long until the eurozone runs out of sticking plaster? How long will this blame game go on between the Member States, with northern eurozone countries arguing that they can afford to keep Greece in the euro but not being honest with their taxpayers that a currency union requires fiscal transfers from the richer countries to the poorer countries – probably for ever? The Greek Government has to play its role and also behave responsibly, as other group leaders have said. It is time to stop the sticking plaster. It is time to start sticking to the rules. If we look at the crisis in the Mediterranean, there is no easy answer, despite what many people claim. We cannot let no one in, yet we cannot let everyone in. But until we have a strategy, we will simply be providing lifeboats, plucking unfortunate desperate people from the sea. The Commission’s plan raises some important issues – targeting traffickers, processing applications and returning those not fleeing persecution; helping those in failing states on the front line. But while some EU countries could probably do more to help, proposing a quota system was a mistake because, instead of cooperation, the Commission has proposed coercion. So instead of solidarity, we now have polarity. Instead of countries working with each other, we have countries arguing with each other. Let us come together in a spirit of cooperation to alleviate the suffering of those in countries from which people flee, to process genuine applications before they make that hazardous journey, and to target the people traffickers who sell a false hope – not another sticking plaster solution until a future summit. And on security and defence, cooperation on coordination, not coercion, should be the principle that we will abide by. In country after country, election after election, the voters are saying what the ECR has been saying: Europe cannot go on as it, Europe has to change. So as the British Prime Minister David Cameron introduces ideas for reform, do not see it as simply a shopping list for Britain, but seize it as a chance for genuine reform of the EU. Then, maybe, all of us in the EU will be better placed to face the challenges: the challenges within our borders, the challenges at our borders, and the challenges beyond our borders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 11, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. –  Mr President, first of all, I want to say to Mr Timmermans – I thought you were singing at the end but you were not – that I fully agree with what you said on migration and with the proposals that you have made. The only point that I would like to make is that you have to follow through on what you said. What you said is true, but what we see now in Hungary – and Mr Pittella referred to this – is a scandal in itself, because it goes against the acquis communautaire. It goes against the common and solidarity-based approach that you have defended here in this House. So I hope that, at the end of your second intervention and in the coming days, the Commission will be clear that what Mr Orbán is doing is against the rules of Europe and that it will not go through. That is what I accept with regard to both the wall and the other issues. My second point is on Greece. I think that we will have a deal. I do not think there is any other choice than to make a deal. There is no other choice, because a Grexit would be the worst thing for everybody: the worst thing for the Greek people, because the first thing that would happen would be a devaluation and another loss of their purchasing power of 30—40% on top of all the efforts of the past; and it would be a bad thing for Europe and for the eurozone, because it would in fact be indicating that the euro is not a stable currency, as you can come in and go out. It would be like a party where you enter when you have money and you go out when you no longer have any money. So I think we are going to find a solution – but will it be long-lasting solution? Let us be honest. What we are talking about is EUR 7 billion in the second package. We are not talking about a solution for Greece, but about how to give these last EUR 7 billion of the second package. Everybody knows – and everybody is writing – that we will discuss a third package in the future and that it is absolutely necessary to have a fundamental solution for Greece. What we are talking about is not a fundamental solution. A fundamental solution for Greece would be based on two elements. The first element is that in Greece they would really start to end the clientelistic and corrupt systems, the oversized public sector and the non—opening of the private markets. That has not been done. It is not about picking a little at low pensions or low wages but about changing the social system that exists. That is not happening – not with the deal that they are making at the moment. A second point is that we must have a structural solution for governing the debt in Europe. I think it would have been far better if they had listened to Parliament and if we had started three years ago with the redemption contract. That should have solved the problem. But now we are dealing with a country like Greece, which is asking for money, and the others say: ‘We will not give money to Greece because what have we received? Why did we not receive the same help?’ With the redemption fund, everybody could have the same help in the future. That was the right way to do it. Finally, on the report: I am pleased with the report by the five Presidents on completing Europe’s economic and monetary union, Mr Timmermans. I think it is a good basis. It is not complete – for example, the redemption fund is not in it – but it is a good basis to start. I hope that we in Parliament can support this approach. Having said that, I have to tell you something – and I am saying this directly to Mr Pittella and Mr Weber: we are going to vote in four or five hours from now on a report – the Berès report. What are we talking about? We are going to vote on the Berès report, and it has less ambition than the paper by the five Presidents. What are we doing? This Parliament, which has always been ahead in economic governance in the European Union, is now going to vote on a report which does not even deal with all these problems. Mr Weber, I know how it works and that you have made a little deal downsizing the whole thing and saying that it is an own initiative report. I can tell you that I have seen better reports from Pervenche Berès. It is not a question of the intelligence of Pervenche Berès, but it is not the best that you have ever done. Having said that, I think that we are going to ask to have it sent back to committee before the start of the vote, because it is completely crazy and completely useless. I say to all my colleagues – and certainly to the EPP – that you will now start voting now on a report that has already been taken off the table due to a good proposal from President Juncker.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 12, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, on Monday I saw communications which saw the solution to the Greek problem at the door. The Eurogroup communication considered it very good, the Commission welcomed it as a very good basis, at the summit everyone said that we were very close to the agreement and, suddenly, internal undermining began.  The International Monetary Fund and some conservative governments, which are a minority within Europe, seem not to want a deal, even though that is in the common interest of both Greece and Europe. On the contrary, they want to undermine it and they want to humiliate the Greek people, to question the need to respect not only the rules, but also the Republic.  The Greek government, in cooperation with the Commission services, has tabled a proposal that ensures settled public finances with primary surpluses, that promotes reforms to combat bureaucracy, corruption, the client state. Which puts an end to the shame of early retirements of people aged forty and fifty, that your political friends, Mr Weber, have voted and implemented in Greece for decades and not SYRIZA, and please let go of intolerance.  It is time for everyone to contribute to solutions to remove the word Grexit from the vocabulary of the European debate, to put the Greek people and Greece on the path to development. So don't finger us, gentlemen of the Conservative party, because you have implemented along with the troika - in violation of European Union rules - a policy that has caused thirty per cent pay and pension cuts, tripled unemployment, brought a twenty-five per cent recession and soared debt from one hundred and twenty-five per cent, to one hundred and eighty per cent of GDP.  We need settled public finances, but also growth as well as sustainable debt and this is a European, political problem and must be solved with shared responsibility.  We have tabled proposals, we have tabled equivalents and now some people from the International Monetary Fund say we do not like equivalents. I don't know. Because we tax the rich, because we tax those who have an income of more than fifty thousand euros a year, those who make profits of more than five hundred thousand euros a year in a country that has one and a half million unemployed and that nine out of ten unemployed do not get a single euro.  The message from my group is clear: a solution is needed, an urgent solution is needed, it is perfectly possible, it is ready on the basis of what was tabled and considered a basis for discussion on Monday.  Mr Timmermans, work on them, the International Monetary Fund does not have to be at the heart of Europe, Europe has the mechanisms and institutions to respond to them.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the ingredients for an exit from the crisis for Greece are known. First of all, these are structural reforms that would allow Greece to recover. I am thinking, in particular, of the establishment of a socially fair, economically efficient and environmentally friendly tax system. The aim is to reform the pension system to make it financially bearable, while respecting the rights of the most vulnerable and insecure pensioners. This includes reducing the military spending that makes Greece one of THE champions, I am sorry to say, of NATO. It is about putting in place an effective administration. It is a matter of effectively combating corruption and clientelism. First element. On all these points, the Greek government, elected in January, may have sometimes belatedly, sometimes clumsily, proved that it was ready to commit.  The second element is investment. Everyone knows that today investing in Greece is out of reach of the Greek economy. I thank the Commission which, through Commissioner Timmermans, has shown that it is ready to commit itself. I would like the Council to be prepared to target the Juncker plan, in particular on the countries that need it most, first and foremost Greece.  The third element is to make Greek debt sustainable. The latter was unsustainable in 2010. It was in 2012 after the first aid plan for Greece. It is still after the second aid plan for Greece, and I would add that the structural reforms that have been imposed on Greece have aggravated the situation. Those who refused to consider a restructuring of the Greek debt have demonstrated, and still show today, either grime economic incompetence, a denial of guilty reality, or an ideological obsession with trying to make borrowers pay the price of irresponsibility alone, leaving the creditors, equally irresponsible, in complete freedom. Today, the restructuring of the Greek debt must be on the agenda and firm commitments must be made on this subject.  Albert Einstein said that madness is about doing, redoing and doing the same thing again, hoping for different results. I hope that instead of madness, collective intelligence will prevail in the Council. I know that some in some creditor governments, within the European Central Bank - even within the European Central Bank! - want to fail and want Greece to leave the eurozone.

Now Mr Timmermans has just said – and I quote – ‘a European army is a long-term European objective’. So thank you very much, Mr Timmermans, for clarifying that position before the referendum. It is clear to me that the three most important issues at this European Council are: how the European Union will deal with the issue of immigration; the controversial TTIP deal; and, of course, Greece. Firstly, the problems surrounding migration were brought home to MEPs yesterday, because a number of British representatives could not get here because of the chaos in Calais, where a workers’ strike resulted in migrants running amok and boarding lorries and cars trying to make their way to the UK, and as a consequence, the Channel Tunnel was closed. But this is nothing compared to what is to come. There are half a million migrants in the Mediterranean waiting to make their way through Europe, and frighteningly, there are another half a million making their way through Africa and the Middle East – and what is worse is that we do not know who these people really are. We are told that ISIS is using this chaos to import their wicked and warped ideology onto our continent, which makes the next terrorist attack not a case of if, but when and where. The answer is not a common EU asylum policy. Mr Timmermans, I have a better suggestion. The answer is an Australian-style ring of steel, which protects our borders and sends out a clear message that Europe is not a soft touch. Now, let us move on to TTIP. We all know how worried you lot are about TTIP by the way you behaved in Strasbourg earlier this month. You cancelled the vote on TTIP; you silenced any debate on the issue; you ignored millions of citizens across Europe who have legitimate concerns. Let me make this clear: TTIP is a corporatist scam which will hurt workers, consumers, pensions, farmers and small businesses. It gives an unfair advantage to large corporations. It is a lobbyist’s dream. There are 30 000 lobbyists here in Brussels – that is over 40 per MEP. There are more lobbyists here than there are in Washington DC, and therefore it is no surprise to me that the Commission and the big groups in this Parliament support TTIP. People are concerned about the damaging effects of TTIP. We should put aside our political differences and stand united against this secretive stitch-up. On a final note, my heart goes out to the people of Greece, who are being impoverished by the European Union. To witness the cradle of democracy being threatened by the Brussels bully-boys is a truly sickening sight.

Mr President, you were looking for me in the front row, I suppose? But democracy is struggling to move forward in this Parliament, as we knew. So it has already come down from a few bleachers, it has five left, but I have no doubt that this Parliament, which is so committed to democracy and respect for all groups, will manage to find a solution and put an end to what appears to all to be a terrifying discrimination.  So, Members, the current negotiations between the European Union and Greece are fierce. Brussels does not want to give up anything and tries to impose on the Greeks the pursuit of hyper-austerity that destroys their country. The reduction of pensions and the minimum wage and the increase in VAT have already destroyed the Greek economy and make no sense, even from a financial point of view. Yet you are asking the Greeks to leave for a tour of this deadly scenario. Everyone knows that Greece, burdened by a debt equal to 180% of its GDP, cannot repay its creditors, but you are asking the Greek people to continue to carry the burden of an absolutely unsustainable public debt. You thus practice slavery for debt against this people, the same debt slavery that had been abolished by Solon in 500 BC. Let me tell you that this is a nice step backwards. If Tsipras refuses your implacable terms, the Greek state will default on its public debt on June 30. As a result, Greece's fragile banks will go bankrupt. We all know that the text voted in 2014 by this Parliament, which we have dubbed 'the wall': a single resolution mechanism, should apply. You will then send all Greek savers into this wall. Have you told the people of Europe that this text requires the seizure of all their deposits and savings bank accounts above EUR 100,000, if their failing banks are to be recapitalised? No? You have carefully hidden it from your constituents? Did you say that Article 6 of this text allows the European Commission to lower this threshold of disposing of savings by 100,000 euros, to what, 20,000, 10,000, 5,000 or zero euros? I will quickly read Article 6 to refresh your memory, the amount covered - the 100,000 euros therefore - is subject to periodic review, taking into account in particular the evolution of the banking sector and the economic and monetary situation in the Union. This review will not take place until July 3, 2020. Phew! Unless unforeseen events make it necessary at a later date. This rule is not only tyrannical, but it is also stupid. When the citizens of European countries understand your manoeuvres, depositors' confidence in their banking system will be destroyed, which will speed up Bank Runs in crisis situations. But you have no choice, to try to save once again, the euro, even at the cost of confiscating the bank deposits of your citizens. You have therefore shamefully voted for this text and then hidden from all savers that you will be able to steal their savings in the event of the bankruptcy of their bank. Gentlemen, it is time to get rid of the golden calf that is the euro and stop these follies, it is time to return to democracy and give back to every people its national currency!", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 17, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Kostas PAPADAKIS", "mepid": "125093", "text": "  NI).

First, on Greece, I insist the Commission will continue its efforts to find a compromise which is acceptable to everyone, which is based on the idea that we should not let the Greek people suffer more, and find a way out of this problem. Those of you who have argued – I refer especially to Mr Nuttall and Ms Le Pen – that that they are great friends of the Greek people and are arguing against the euro and saying that we should leave the euro, should perhaps reconsider their friendship or their position, because the Greek people by a vast majority do not want to get rid of the euro. They want to find a solution within the euro and, if you declare yourselves to be such great friends of the Greek people, you might perhaps even follow their wisdom in that. Now I can see somebody sitting next to Ms Le Pen making a signal as though you are completely crazy. So your friends call you crazy. (Interjection from the floor: ‘The euro is a disaster, Sir’) Sir, with friends like you, I would rather have enemies. (Interjection from the floor: ‘Better than the Eurozone’) Another subject that surprised me is that Mr Nuttall complained about the fact that his MEPs could not reach the European Parliament yesterday because of a strike. I was under the impression that his party did everything possible to get rid of the European Parliament. You cannot have it both ways, Mr Nuttall. (Interjections from the floor: ‘No, he said British MEPs’; ‘They are all trying to enter Britain, Sir, they are all trying to flee Europe’) I would hope that not all British MEPs forgot about their wonderful, wonderful legacy of being open to the world, of being self-confident enough not to be thinking in terms of building gates along the borders of Europe. This brings me immediately to my second point, which is on migration. Either we will find European solutions, or we will not find solutions and keep on working with the problems we have today. That is my deep conviction. I think to create the impression that, by keeping people out, we will solve the problem is not only morally suspect but is politically impossible. It will not happen. We are not Australia. We are not located in the middle of an ocean. We cannot apply the same solutions. By the way, what are you going to say to the family fleeing war in Damascus, or in other places in Syria or elsewhere? ‘You have no right to asylum, you should stay there, you should be killed there? No, you should stay in the region.’ Yes, go and say that to countries like Jordan. Go and say that to a country like Lebanon, where one quarter of the population are refugees. Sir, I think you need to rethink this idea that, by simply keeping people out, we will solve the problem. Europe will need to take its responsibility to find a sustainable solution based on our values. If we compromise our values on this issue, we will compromise our values on all other issues that we need to deal with, including issues pertaining to our own citizens. (Applause) So I plead with the Council to follow the Commission’s reasoning tomorrow. Give us better reasoning, give us better solutions or follow our reasoning. The Commission will stick to its proposition. I feel reinforced today by the position of the majority of this Parliament to stick to this proposition. We have tried before with voluntary schemes. They have failed. I think it is an issue of political and moral integrity to see that and to draw the right conclusions from that. I wish the members of the European Council the inspiration to take this seriously. On the specific issue raised by Mr Verhofstadt on Hungary, the Commission is now in close consultation with the Hungarian Government to know what these technical reasons are; why, etc. We are not even sure that there is a suspension. There are all sorts of rumours, so we are trying to find out exactly what has happened. We will certainly demand of all Member States that they apply the rules and, if there is an emergency situation – there are indications that Hungary is facing a sudden enormous surge of refugees; that can be an emergency situation – we have instruments at our disposal to assist Member States to address that emergency situation. But simply stopping admission is not one of the instruments allowed by European rules. We are there to assist Member States and we are also fully committed to assisting Hungary in this. We are in the process of talking to them about this, but we do urge all Member States to simply respect the rules we have agreed jointly. We will certainly continue to follow this very closely with Hungary. Finally, I want to reiterate, on behalf of the Commission, that this European Council needs to take bold steps forward in terms of the migration issue. If we do not decide today, more people will die and we will not be able to start implementing the rules and the necessary measures we will need to discuss in July. The Commission will appeal – Jean-Claude Juncker will appeal – to all other members of the European Council to take responsibility on the basis of the Commission’s proposal, with strong support from the European Parliament.

Thank you for this very dynamic, accurate, specific discussion! About migration. As I said, the Council is looking for a comprehensive, balanced and long-term solution. I understand that the European Commission is determined to defend its proposal, but the Council is not yet convinced that this is the best way to solve the causes of the problem, rather than simply combating the consequences of the crisis.  Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. If there is a flood at any point, it is necessary to build a dam instead of squealing water with a bucket. I would stress (if I did not say enough clearly at first) that no one in the Council has any doubts about the need to help those who really need help. No one in the Council has any doubts about the need to strengthen development cooperation. No one has any doubts about cooperation with countries of origin and assistance to 'frontline countries' about the need to combat people smugglers. But we still need to discuss the best way to achieve a smart, sustainable solution, a real and effective solution.  At the same time, the Council has always been ready to react. The Council has been actively working to implement the measures approved by the April Extraordinary European Council and to prevent the loss of life in the Mediterranean. I would remind you that the Council has supported a triple increase in the frontex agency's budget. Member States have provided additional technical and human resources for Frontex. And this has already allowed people to be saved lives in the Mediterranean and prevented the april tragedy from happening again. Secondly, as I said, the Council has agreed to launch a common security and defence policy operation in the Mediterranean. Thirdly, the Council is actively working on preventive and comprehensive cooperation with countries of origin and transit. The Council will find a solution and agreement on truly comprehensive solutions to migration policy as a whole. About Greece. I understand the impatience of the European Parliament. We are all looking impatiently towards Greece, and I agree that the situation is not straightforward. However, we must allow Greece to show us all that it is able to offer and implement a reform plan. And tomorrow's meeting, I hope, will bring positive news.  A man doesn't drown because he ever falls into the water. A man drowns because he stays in the water. We must give Greece a chance to get out of this pit. We can only hope that the outcome of the negotiations will be sustainable. Reforms and consolidation are always painful. However, from our national experience, we can also say that voters are able to appreciate positively the courage of the government and the ability to make difficult decisions operationally, to do the necessary work to ensure stability, prosperity and security for their citizens. Therefore, a solution is needed, not prolonged agony and stagnation. I think it is in all our interests to see a strong, united, economically prosperous European Union, a single euro area, a stable economy. We must therefore be able to overcome its difficulties, be able to act boldly and do the necessary work, and issues relating to the common economy of the European Union, on national-specific recommendations, on the five presidents' report, and also the question of strengthening the European Union's internal and external security, are equally important on the European Council's agenda. These are all very, very closely related to each other.  Thanks for today's discussion! Let me take this opportunity to thank the European Parliament very much for the very fruitful cooperation of these six months with the Latvian Presidency. We have had dynamic discussions, we have sought solutions to many difficulties, and important issues have been agreed. Thank you great for that! And I would like to wish not only the next Luxembourg Presidency, but the European Union as a whole, that the next semester be calmer, so that there is less crisis, but more stability, security and growth.

The annexation of Crimea and the outbreak of war in Ukraine, and the demonstration of Russia's military forces, including at the border with Poland, the EU's external border, followed by Vladimir Putin's attempt to tell Europe that Russia was not taking part in these events, have challenged the existing European peace deal.

Such social and economic uncertainty makes it difficult for us to concentrate on finding solutions to today's challenges and problems together. This is a huge mistake, because only by acting together, in a spirit of loyalty, can we ensure that the citizens of the Union are safe and that their rights are respected.

Finally, in the context of the debate on the future of Economic and Monetary Union, there is no reference to the need to strengthen the euro area horizontally, that is to say, to extend it to Member States which have a legal obligation to adopt the single currency. In this way, Economic and Monetary Union would be politically strengthened while reducing the democratic deficit, as the European Parliament would truly be the euro Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 50, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Jarosław WAŁĘSA", "mepid": "96774", "text": "  in writing. – As over 100 000 migrants came to Europe this year, and 2 000 are missing or dead in the Mediterranean, there can be no question but that this is a most pressing problem.

I would also like to welcome the competent action of the Presidency of the Council, of the Lithuanian Presidency, which has made it possible for us to reach a good port, and of course to thank all colleagues, all the rapporteurs, all the shadow rapporteurs, all the officials, officials not only of the political groups but also officials of the secretariats of the Committee on Budgets and the Economy, who have proven that we have great competence in this House. A special word for co-rapporteur Udo Bullmann: we both had hours and hours of meeting, hours and hours of meetings, more than two hundred hours of work, but we can say it was worth it.  It was worth it because we have a fund that will enable growth and jobs. It was worth it because this is a new fund, an innovative fund, a fund that also provokes and is challenging, a fund that does not allocate either by regions, nor by themes. And so everyone will have to do their job, everyone will have to look and those interested will have to do so, the beneficiaries, to take advantage of this fund.  A fund that says something like this: I am here to support viable projects that the current funds, that current programmes, which financial markets do not support at the moment and, in this sense, this additional nature, this complementarity, is extremely important.  A fund that will therefore, with its EUR 315 billion, EUR 240 billion for investments, EUR 75 billion for businesses and, in particular, for small and medium-sized enterprises, help growth, help the competitiveness of our economy.  A fund also proves that it is not politicians who create jobs, but must do everything to provide conditions for job creation. A fund also open, from research, through broadband, energy efficiency, but also education, health, tourism, infrastructure. A fund that will enable a stronger recovery in the European Union.  A fund also that we want to continue and therefore the action we have had to make sure that if it goes well, but if it does not go as well as that the Commission will come up with a new proposal so that it can continue and obviously if it is a disaster it would not make sense for it to continue. But it's not going to be a disaster.  We also provided transparency to the decision, we gave democratic legitimacy to this fund and we were able to reduce the impact it had on two important funding programmes. I am referring to Horizon 2020 and the Connect Europe Facility, where we have reduced an impact by EUR 1 billion on these programmes. But here I want to tell the Commission that this work will continue and in every budgetary procedure we will continue to do everything we can to reduce the impact on these funds. And, as I said, we will try to minimise as much as possible the impact that the guarantee of this fund has on these two programmes.  A fund which is also a fund which demonstrates that sharing is important and based on a Guarantee of the European Union, a common guarantee, a guarantee also from the Member States, an EIB guarantee.  I am confident that we all want growth, we all want jobs and so we will vote for this fund.

Mr President, Commissioner, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. No wonder we're excited. It's about big things, it's about important things. Europe does indeed have a massive investment gap: 200, 300 billion a year – these are the lower figures that the Commission gives us. An investment gap that lacks schools, transport links, networks, broadband in the regions – broadband for all, so that value can get to where people are. There are many things that we urgently need in the fight against climate change: building renovation, energy efficiency – these are our big issues. That is why it was right for Jean-Claude Juncker to take up a proposal from the political debate, from the election campaign, and said: if I become President of the Commission – and he has kept his word – I will make a proposal to that effect. This is a question of our performance and viability, our sustainability, our economic and social systems. We have welcomed this proposal, not because we say that it is already sufficient in volume, but because we say that it is a step in the right direction if we do it right. Not all reactions made us feel good at the beginning. Member States, I say it, have been very reluctant to say whether they are participating in this fund. I would like to ask: what kind of European consciousness is this, if you only take part in a project where there is an immediate juste return? This is not the spirit in which we can work in the long term. There should be some discussion on this issue on the Council bench. We need the European Investment Bank, but it, too, may have thought that it could simply carry on as before. That, too, would not be a sufficient attitude. And private investors should know that it can't be about takeaway effects, it's about additionality. We want to open up markets, we want to give small and medium-sized enterprises a chance, we want new employment to be created. That is why it has been consistent that Parliament has cooperated excellently across party lines and that we have set ourselves clear objectives. We want to invest in the future, not in the past. That is why: clear guidelines with investment criteria, investment guidelines, codecision – and a scoreboard to ensure that the right priorities are met. The volume is not enough. That is why we want to enable the regions, the Member States, the promotional banks and the platforms to invest. Yes, they should! The Commission will make a statement today to ensure that this does not become even more complicated. And we need a clear level of leadership, clear responsibilities, the appointment of a senior executive, in which Parliament is centrally involved. For this successful project, which can be the beginning of something great, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs from 15 committees in this House who have worked in the shortest possible time, all the staff, the services and the good cooperation with the institutions. I believe that this Parliament has shown that it is capable of doing good in the shortest possible time, too important, and in a great way.

I also want to thank the other rapporteurs who were working on this issue. I have to say that these people were very tough negotiators but also very result-oriented negotiators, and it meant that in record time we managed to pass such a difficult and detailed piece of legislation. It was only possible because of the political will, because we share the same view: Europe needs investment, and we have to deliver fast in order to create a better atmosphere and environment for private investors to invest in this continent. As I said, these people were very tough negotiators, and I even owe my first sunrise in this building to them! The European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) is a very important tool to address market failures – market failures which partially originate from regulatory changes. We have regulated in good faith, but it has had some negative impact, which we are now ready to address. Europe is not primarily lacking in liquidity: there is plenty of money, plenty of liquidity in the private sector, but there are also plenty of reasons why this liquidity is not used for productive investment in the real economy. One of the reasons is lack of risk financing, and that is exactly what EFSI is providing now. We want to provide risk financing for small and medium-sized enterprises, for innovative companies, for start-ups, but at the same time for larger companies and public-private partnership projects in order to get productive investment and create jobs. EFSI will not change the whole world. We also need other measures to get more investment. We need measures at international level, which means structural reforms in order to strengthen external competitiveness, and this is what our Member States are doing at the moment. We also need other measures at European level, and that is exactly why the Commission will also concentrate on the third pillar of the Investment Plan, which means widening and deepening of the internal market. So I would like to spread the same spirit of delivering fast to those areas in which we are talking about the deepening and widening of the single market. Why do we not deliver as fast on those proposals which will harmonise the Digital Single Market or create the Digital Single Market or those proposals coming from the Commission which are dealing with the Energy Market Union or Capital Markets Union? These proposals will have an even bigger impact on investment and job creation. According to the European Parliament’s own assessment, if we had a Digital Single Market, its impact on our economy would be something like EUR 415 billion per year. That is why we have to deliver as fast with these proposals as we did with EFSI. The Commission is already working on the various documents and actions which are needed for implementation. In less than a month, the Commission will be in a position to decide to extend the EU guarantees to the projects warehoused by the EIB and the European Investment Fund, to appoint the members of the Steering Board alongside the EIB, and to issue the Scoreboard under a Delegated Act. The process for recruiting the members of the Investment Committee will be launched within two weeks, and we aim to have them in place by September. In September, honourable Members, you will have the occasion to hear and, hopefully, approve the candidates for the position of Managing Director and Deputy Managing Director, and we plan to have the European Investment Advisory Hub up and running after the summer, and the European Investment Project Portal by the end of the year. So we are really delivering fast. In this context, and on behalf of the Commission, allow me to make the following statement on our assessment of one-off contributions within the context of the EFSI initiative for the purpose of implementing the Stability and Growth Pact: ‘Without prejudice to the prerogatives of the Council in the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), one-off contributions by Member States, either by a Member State or by national promotional banks classified in the general government sector or acting on behalf of the Member State, into the EFSI or thematic or multi-country investment platforms established for the implementation of the Investment Plan, should in principle qualify as one-off measures within the meaning of Article 5 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1466/97 and Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1467/97.’", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 59, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Kristalina Georgieva", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, first I want to join my colleague, Jyrki Katainen, in thanking the Chairs, Mr Gualtieri and Mr Arthuis, and the two rapporteurs, Mr Bullmann and Mr Fernandes, and also many others sitting in this room, such as Mrs Van Brempt, who have worked so hard with us to make the Fund happen. The negotiations were tough for a reason. We faced a very tall order: to find space to fund the aspiration that this Commission brought, with Parliament and with the Council, to unleash the confidence and courage of our investors for the benefit of our people, and to do so in a very tight budgetary environment. It was not because we had different objectives. We had the same objective, which was to make the best use of our people’s sacrifice. But this objective had to be achieved by making very tough trade-offs between well-performing programmes – Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility – and the margin we need so that we can face the challenges of today and tomorrow. We made this choice together, and now the tough job begins. Institutionalising the Fund is only the first step. From here on, we have to make sure that it delivers on the promises that we have outlined.

After the necessary period of saving and restoring the sustainability of public finances, it is time to invest in the European economy and create new jobs. In this context, the creation of a European Fund for Strategic Investments and the creation of a business-friendly environment deserve great support.  As rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I assessed the European Commission's proposal with shadow rapporteurs on its impact on job creation in Europe. I am very pleased that the final version of the regulation contains clear indications that one of the main objectives of the Fund is precisely to promote employment and to invest in sectors with great potential for job creation. The Fund will also support broadly understood social investments, i.e. education, research and development, human resources training. A very important provision in the final version of the Regulation is the assessment of the social impact of the Fund and its impact on job creation, carried out in the framework of reporting to the Institutions of the European Union and in the framework of the review procedure.  I am convinced that this will allow more informed and responsible decisions to be made in the future. The fund's support is estimated to generate 1,300,000 jobs.

As rapporteur for ITRE, I would like to emphasise two points and both points are about money. First of all, where does the money in this fund come from and secondly, where are we going to invest the money? Let me start with that last point. In the ITRE Commission, but also in other committees, it has been defended with gusto that it is important that we invest in the future and not in the past. In other words, investing in anything is not good enough for Parliament. We have clear policies in this Parliament, but also in the European Union, with the support of the Commission. We have policies on climate, energy, the Energy Union, the digital union. We know where we want to go and this money needs to be invested in it. That is crucial for us. I am very pleased with the final compromise that we have reached around the scoreboard, around the investment guidelines, around the criteria.  The first point: where does the money come from? It was a very difficult point for the European Parliament, Commissioner. We talked about it for a long time, sometimes we had difficult moments. This Parliament is very attached to the programmes that deal with the future, in particular investment in research and development, in energy and transport. It was very painful to see that the money was being taken from that very well.  We have reached a compromise, let us be clear. Do I think that's great? Am I super content with it? No, I would have liked the fact that no euro would be taken out of these programmes. But we have reached a compromise that is an honourable compromise, Commissioner.

The EIE offers us two essential general virtues, from my point of view, for our discourse with the citizens. Firstly, it has restored the lyrics of the European anthem, so that it may return to the \"Hymn to Joy\", after these terrible seven years of skinny cows, suffering, poverty and recoil of Europe. The virtue of the Juncker Plan is to have regained the original momentum of common Europe. After a crisis like a war, it's time to grow back: employment, employment, employment. The second virtue is more complex - and two-sided currency - and opens the debate on coexistence between normative framework and growth. One part, those in the surplus, are calling for the flexibility of State aid rules. On the other hand, those in the deficit, we seek that investments in European programmes, clearly and clearly European, such as the EIE, do not penalize public debt. If the first virtue is to be acknowledged to the Commission, to President Juncker, supported from the minute minus zero by this Parliament, the second belongs to an intensive negotiation, nocturnity by, in a trilogue which was somewhat strange at the beginning, because in Parliament we start by confronting the Council and the Commission forming an adversary bloc, and I must thank in particular - and is present - Vice-President Georgieva , for opening the door to the solution by making the Commission recover its interinstitutional role of helping us and therefore helping citizens to find the solution. And this solution, after hours and hours of intensive negotiation as few, has resulted in the transport sector taking EUR 500 million out of the Council's mouth or pocket, which is back to the CEF, and we have even been able to advance another 500 million coming out in the form of direct subsidies, which is what our transport sector needs most. We have also ensured that the lever effect of the 1 x 15 EIE guarantee is consistent with the principles and values of the trans-European network programme, thus being complementary and with an emphasis precisely on the sectors in which the Commission encountered the most difficulties: urban mobility, accessibility, safety, pollution reduction, accidents , etc. and also expanding the basic and global networks through possible new nodes, but always with reference to the Connecting Europe Facility, its principles and its objectives and values, further ensuring the presence of transport experts in all the necessary areas of programme governance. In Parliament we have now fulfilled our task of improving the agreement. It is now up to the Commission and the European Investment Bank, together with private initiative, Member States, regions, civil society, etc. to launch it to have the effect of job creation and growth in this employment-intensive sector as ours.

As chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I do not want to add anything in substance. I would just like to go to the lectern to say thank you to those who have contributed to the success of this project: the Commission, with Jean-Claude Juncker at the helm, but also Vice-Presidents Katainen and Georgieva, who are here today. I would like to thank our rapporteurs for their leadership. The fact that we have kept to the timetable is a great success for all of us as institutions. We have shown that we can give answers to the citizens. And the idea that investments are necessary, as Mr Bullmann has said, is a key element of this plan. Millions of people in Europe may not be so enthusiastic about the technology we are adopting today. But i hope in a few years' time they will say that this technology has led to jobs, investment and the future for this continent. That is the hope that surrounds us all. However, I would also like to emphasise once again that this will certainly not be enough on its own. The Commission has also pointed out on several occasions that, in order to create jobs, money is needed, that investment is needed, but, on the other hand, structural reforms and budgetary discipline, that this triad of Europe's reform efforts must always be seen. I would have a political wish at the end. I had heard that this project, this programme, has now been adopted by a large majority in the advisory committees and that both left and right in the House, the extremes in our Parliament, this project, have rejected this plan. In other words, the extremes are against us doing this.

Finally, we are abandoning this passion for austerity, so harmful to Europe. Because cutting policies neither create growth nor create jobs nor, of course, help European citizens. But in recent months we are seeing changes in economic policy. It may not yet be too evident in the day-to-day life, but that change is the change that society has demanded and which this group has asked the European Commission to make. First we have seen how this Commission has revised the pact for flexibility, stability and growth, giving more flexibility and more scope for action to implement growth-oriented policies. We have also seen a change in fiscal policy, decisively pursuing fraud and evasion and also giving a new approach to European corporation tax; and we also just saw, a few days ago, the report of the five presidents reinforcing economic and monetary union. And today we are here talking about this Juncker Plan, an investment plan that wants to mobilize 315 billion euros to be invested in the real economy, which is what really touches people. Commission, Council and Parliament negotiate tomorrow, afternoon and night — literally – to reach an agreement that can be approved today, because the need to give an urgent impetus to investment in Europe has made us work against time but the urgent has not prevented us from working on what is important, because we tabled more than 1,400 amendments to this plan, because we believed that the proposal could be improved , and the outcome of the Agreement demonstrates this. With our work we have improved funding. We've got 1 billion euros more. And, therefore, we do not affect so much programmes that already existed and which also invest in the future of the European Union, such as Horizon 2020 and the Connecting Europe Facility. Our funding proposal was more appropriate and more ambitious, but it was a pity that the Council did not have the courage to give the necessary financial support to such an important project. In fact, it is a pity that the Council is not even in this debate today. But in any case, the last word on funding is not said. In September we will negotiate the 2016 budget and we are also on the eve of negotiating a review of the Financial Framework and look forward to more resources for the Plan. But not only has the funding been changed, but there has not been a single article of the Regulation that we have not improved. And I'm done.

I am pleased to note that the fund will be managed by the European Investment Bank, and I am also content that the multiannual financial framework (MFF) remains unaltered. That means no additional call on taxpayers’ money. But I do have concerns: first that, in application, this really is a new financial instrument doing a new job, not just an extension of current schemes; second, it is important that additionality really does mean spreading excellence and widening participation. I also have concerns about whether smaller businesses and research facilities will be sufficiently aware that the funding is available and whether it will be readily accessible. Finally, I have a warning to Member States. The measures being taken by the Investment Bank, the Central Bank and the Commission will go a long way towards injecting life back into the European economy.

The idea is to show that other policies are in other sectors, and this fund is going to work in a completely different area. It will therefore be extremely important to clarify the relationship between the Structural Funds and the ESI Funds. This is not yet fully explained – I therefore report the urgent need for complementarity in this area.  Finally, I will just say that we are dealing with a rather risky experience. Namely, if Parliament works at this pace with the Commission and with the Council – and this is an example of how we can work quickly – this will be a good example, but undoubtedly a serious challenge, because it was indeed, as the Commissioner said, meeting the deadline and working in a very short time.

Mr President, I too would like to welcome this excellent effort by everyone, but also by Kathleen Van Brempt and, of course, by all the rapporteurs for EFSI, because the expectations that have now been created are too great for the whole of the European Union. But the concerns are just as great about how leverage will ultimately work to achieve the EUR 300 15 billion target. It concerns us, of course, whether this objective can be achieved without further burdening the Horizon programme. The debate is therefore also about the fact that there is money available for investment, but it is also important that projects in the Union, which really have a public interest, are also profitable.  If there is one dimension that I could mention, it is that in countries where the crisis has hit the most there are significant opportunities to invest in efficient projects and infrastructure projects, but there is not enough incentive to finance them from the private sector to achieve the necessary leverage.

I agree with you that we need more investment for Europe. With the trilogue agreement on the European Fund for Strategic Investments, we have certainly created a very good basis. However, I would like to pick up a few points briefly. First of all, it is very positive that there will be no political impact on the EFSI's project selection. Investment decisions must remain investment decisions. And we need a selection process for the projects that is geared to quality, sustainability and legal certainty. This includes a concrete examination of the real added value of each project application. I also welcome the fact that the agreement lays down the principle of risk diversification. This means that all regions and sectors can benefit from this fund. And that also means that not only large-scale projects can benefit, but above all small and medium-sized enterprises. We do not want to create a new bureaucratic fund, but a stable and attractive framework for investors. Only in this way can we also promote growth in Europe. Investment and forward-looking economic policy are two sides of the same coin. Europe must continue its efforts in this regard. Investment in projects alone will not be enough, and we must continue to invest in our reform efforts, in our competitiveness. Only in this way can the investment plan become a success at the end of the day.

Thank you very much, dear colleagues, for your opinions and advice. Now we are turning to the implementation phase, and it is very important that we all pass the message on in our Member States – first of all to companies. If you have a plan to invest in something which is considered a high-risk project, or if it is difficult to get financing purely from the private financial sector, you can call on the European Investment Bank and ask if they could help get financing. Nobody can guarantee this, but companies do not need any governmental approval; they can contact the EIB today or tomorrow. There are lots of hardworking people at the EIB, and they are willing to help the companies in their investment plans. The second message, which I hope we all could pass on in our Member States, is that we need a local intermediary for SME financing. I have visited 24 Member States since the beginning of the year, and in every single country I have heard the same message. In most cases, SMEs can get financing from the banks, but venture capital is a very scarce resource. There is a lack of equity financing everywhere. So, if countries are interested in improving SME financing, it is your duty to establish a local intermediary. It can, of course, be a commercial bank, but in many cases national development banks or promotional banks can be an intermediary for SMEs. Private venture capital funds can also apply for resources from the EFSI and serve their clients. This is the message I am constantly passing on when visiting Member States, and I hope everybody here does the same. The final comment is that we strongly encourage Member States, as well as the regions of Member States, to establish national or regional – and sometimes cross-border – investment platforms. It basically means a special-purpose vehicle into which public money can be put. National promotional banks can finance those vehicles and pension money can go there. Insurance companies can chip in and apply risk financing from the EFSI and opt to protect themselves and finance those high-risk private sector or public-private partnership projects. Implementation is very important. The EU cannot implement this beyond what we have done already. We need an SME intermediary, we need a message to bigger companies that you can contact the EIB already today, and we need national or regional investment platforms.

An advisory platform to help structure projects, a advisory platform that will be free for public entities and where small and medium-sized enterprises will only pay a third of the costs. A platform that will help this plan move forward and now get to work with this plan.  We also have a portal, a portal that will give visibility to investments. There are also platforms: they can be regional, they can be national, they can be thematic, where third countries can also be present, using the guarantee; and can contribute to the Energy Union, they can also contribute, for example, to the Digital Union.

This applies to the agreement on the content. We in the Steering Board will blame the EIB and the Commission for the fact that there are good products, for good results, and this also applies to the selection of people. We will insist that the best are taken and not make room for anything else. My final comment is on my colleagues and their staff. The rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs have done an excellent job, especially, of course, those who have worked excellently for them in the services, in the personal offices and in the group offices, as always.

The EFSI has been presented to us as the key to lifting the European economy and directing private capital towards the long-term financing of the real economy. But the deceptive propaganda on the Juncker plan hides many doubts, not least about the ability to mobilise EUR 315 billion in a few years thanks to a miraculous and unrealistic multiplier effect, and many questionable choices. Starting from the decision to cut billions in investment in research and innovation, to divert funds destined for \"Horizon 2020\" and \"Connecting Europe Facility\" to EFSI, to that of still betting on private capital in search of short-term profits and on infrastructure with no added value, including projects with high environmental impact such as relifiers and gas storage; and the choice to use public money to cover potential losses on high-risk projects. I believe that Europe needs a major public investment plan to stimulate the real economy and employment, not major works built through public-private partnerships with a very poor cost-benefit ratio for the community, which have all too often fuelled clientele systems, corruption and mafia infiltration.

Mr President, Commissioner, we have known for a long time that economic and monetary union is unfinished. In this Parliament, under the previous Parliament, we have taken a position with the report of our former colleague Mrs Thyssen. I welcome this report and hope that it will continue to inspire the work of the Commission and the Council.  But unfortunately since then, this urgency has still not happened and when we look at the level of unemployment, low inflation, too low growth in the European Union, let alone Greece, we realize that there is an urgent need to look again at this issue of economic and monetary union. On the eve of a European Council which will be referred to the report of the five presidents, to which our President has made a contribution which I welcome, we, as the European Parliament, must have the courage to take a stand on issues that divide us. If this urgent issue is so dragging on, it is because it is a subject that divides us. However, I say here, the balance we have found around this report shows that there is a possible path, that there is progress that is possible, with or without treaty revision. And we're demonstrating that we can move the lines.  We also say that the first step that has been taken by the European Commission with the 'flexibility' communication is a useful step that needs to be stabilised. It allows us to reaffirm that the issue of investment in the European Union, beyond the EFSI, is an issue that must be dealt with constantly and have in the crosshairs. We cannot settle for an EFSI and consider it to be a one-time measure. The issue of investment must become a key indicator to ensure that we are conducting the right economic policy at the level of each Member State and at the aggregate level.  We say that structural reform is a demanding reform, which must be evaluated over time in terms of results, not only in terms of labour costs, but also by integrating social, environmental and economic criteria. We also say that the troika system cannot be repeated, that more needs to be done and that is probably the most important message of this report. The European semester must enable us to pursue better economic policies for the whole of the European Union. And where it needs to be done, we will have to have the courage, because it will probably be necessary to correct the rules to make them simpler and more complete and to improve economic governance. There is also a need to focus, much more than the report of the five presidents, on the issue of convergence, let us admit. I have a deep conviction that convergence will not wait too long, as we know that our economic and monetary union suffers from our differences.  Macroeconomic imbalances between Member States and also within some Member States should be considered. That is something that needs to be emphasized.  We will have to have an approach that goes beyond the rules to have an economic policy, to be able to assess the situation and the perspective of the euro area and to articulate economic policies according to this diagnosis. We also say in this report that the debt rule needs to be examined more closely, because clearly it does not correspond to the reality of the European economies.  And then beyond that, in a revision of the treaties that will have to be anticipated, because I am convinced, and I will conclude, Mr President, that, as far as economic and monetary union is concerned, we will have to show the same political will that we have been able to mobilise to complete the banking union.

I would like to start by congratulating you on tabling this draft report. Let me briefly recall where we have come from. The Commission published its communication on the six- and two-pack review last year as a basis for debate. With this report you have responded to our invitation to the debate, for which I thank you, in particular as the report is the outcome of thorough and long discussions in this House. It proves that the issues at stake are important and of concern to all of us. For this reason, I am particularly glad to know that our views largely converge. We all share the common objective of an efficient and effective economic governance framework. The reform introduced by the six- and two-pack legislation has gone a long way towards this goal. The reform has strengthened the governance framework and has made it deeper, broader and more effective. Here I can assure you that the Commission is resolved to follow both the letter and the spirit of the six- and two-pack reform in its entirety. It is not without challenges, however. While the governance framework is no smarter, it is also more complex, which creates challenges for transparency and ownership, which in turn affects the enforcement and implementation of reforms. This Commission has taken measures to improve the transparency and effectiveness of the framework. This concerns, in particular, the streamlining of the European Semester and clarification of the flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact. We all view the European Semester as an important vehicle to coordinate economic policies and deliver reforms, and we all agree that national ownership built on wide consultation of national stakeholders and supported by democratic oversight is key for implementation of reforms. For this reason, the new European Semester places so much focus on prioritising consultations and debates. Discussions in the European Parliament, in particular in the context of the economic dialogue, are important elements in guaranteeing the transparency and legitimacy of the European Semester. In the same spirit of transparency and clarity, the Commission presented its communication on flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP), and I am glad that you recognised our efforts. We are going to have a debate on SGP later today, so, for the sake of brevity, let me only emphasise that the flexibility communication was an important step towards better aligning fiscal and economic surveillance, towards creating stronger incentives for reforms and towards ensuring consistency between EDP recommendations and the CSRs. The flexibility communication was one of the components of the economic policy strategy this Commission presented in the Annual Growth Survey (AGS). With their strengthened governance framework with the Commission’s AGS priorities, we are on the right path to overcome the legacy of the crisis. However, our ambition must go further. In particular, the euro area needs a framework which is resilient and robust to any future crises, so that any doubts about the stability of the euro area are removed. I can see there is full agreement on this point among us. Tomorrow, EU leaders, including the President of the European Parliament, will discuss the next steps towards better economic governance in the euro area, based on the Five Presidents’ Report. The report you are adopting today will be a valuable contribution to further improvements in the governance framework. The Commission is fully committed to take forward the initiative to strengthen EMU, and we hope we can count on your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 164, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Anne SANDER", "mepid": "24594", "text": "   rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.

For the EPP, credible economic governance is first and foremost also implementing what you have agreed to do. In our view our economic governance framework is not the cause of the economic difficulties that Europe finds itself in, it is an instrument for addressing imbalances within Member States early on and making sure that we do not run up unsustainable debts. Is this framework then perfect? Surely not. Procedures can be streamlined, as has been said by the Commissioner; they can be better timed. We clearly need a more transparent democratic debate about the key points of our economic policy agenda and we need increased ownership and involvement by national parliaments. For the longer term everyone can see that our monetary union is not perfect or complete, but for steps to be taken to deepen our monetary union we first need to make sure that the current system actually works. In our view the economic governance framework needs to watch over – do I dare say it as a Christian Democrat? – the Holy Trinity of responsible public finances, structural reforms to improve competitiveness, and investments that can create growth and jobs – investments that are attracted by stability and competitiveness, not by running up debt. This will help make our economy stronger, making the eurozone as a whole stronger and more convergent. Then, and only then, can we take the next step that we should take in deepening EMU. It is a question of doing things in the right order, and this order I also see reflected in the Five Presidents’ report.

When you leave, you will be with deep scars: unemployment has doubled, skilled young people from the less competitive regions have emigrated, and investment has dropped to historic lows. The conditions for growing up together have never been more difficult. We must be aware that the greater the divergences, the less viable the single currency will be.  That is why the Juncker Commission's option to finally apply the flexibility contained in the Stability and Growth Pact makes perfect sense. Accommodating strategic investment and structural reforms in the rules, reconciling these rules with the economic cycle is a matter of pure common sense.  The Berès report touches on some of these aspects, but it is important to remember here that the single currency will not survive if we do not revise the concept of structural reforms, selecting those that promote a genuine convergence of competitiveness. It will not survive if we do not create minimum social rights at European level; if we do not stabilise the markets, fulfilling the promise of creating a common deposit guarantee of up to EUR 100,000 in the banking union; if we do not put the Troikas, the European Stability Mechanism and the Budgetary Treaty under the Community method; if we do not find a common solution to the sovereign debt problem; if we do not create a European instrument capable of relaunching economies in crisis without causing a recession; if we do not end the practice in which countries steal tax matters from each other while at the same time sanctioning themselves when their budgets are not balanced.

It requires compliance with the rules in our treaties. It requires a shift towards a social market economy and a market economy policy. Unfortunately, this report makes no mention of this. The report is not a great report, it lacks perspective. While the five Presidents have made a forward-looking mark-up aimed at renovating public budgets, stimulating growth and creating jobs, this report does not mention this. It falls behind positions that we have believed we have already overcome in the past. There is no merger of the country-specific recommendations with the EDP and the macroeconomic imbalance. There is no clear commitment to the rules, there is no verifiability by the European Court of Justice, there is no insolvency procedure for states, there is no uniform external representation of the euro. We consider it totally unacceptable, downright dangerous, that we call for the six-pack to be put on hold at the expense of fiscal discipline. The Communication by the European Commission on flexibility, which we consider to be partially in breach of the Treaty, is explicitly praised here. We reject that! It is not enough for the mere announcement of structural reforms to be taken into account in the examination of the EU Commission without parliamentary decisions and without their implementation. No, we need more, not less commitment, more, no less regularity, more, not less implementation and support for reform policy by national parliaments and governments. None of this is what this report does. On the contrary, it opens the door to the weakening of the Stability and Growth Pact. That is why the ALDE Group cannot agree to this.

For example, on the problem of the fact that balance of payments surpluses are not only good if, for example, it comes from wage retention and dumping of other countries' domestic markets. But the majority refused to see the problem. The peoples of Europe need - yes, they want - a different path. They must have a say in their country's economy and not see it governed by the European Union, and they must have solutions to poverty and unemployment, not more of the same. It was a new answer that we should have given them. With hope and with the future, with new frameworks and opportunities to develop welfare instead of dismantling it.

Thank you very much, dear colleagues. The first thing is a thank you to the rapporteur, who I think has made us have had a good collaboration. However, I have to say that my group's vote is going to be negative, not least because I believe that the right of this Parliament has wanted to impose a report that is timid, not ambitious and extremely conservative, and clear and clear support for what is the current governance framework. And I think it's a mistake; and I, in any case, have to regret that, since the Social Democratic Group, this pressure has been ceded. Look, the Marco has failed. The objectives sought by the Framework itself that we have approved go against exactly the rules we have given ourselves; among other things because, with the rules we have applied to ourselves, today we have more deficits, more indebtedness and more recession and, therefore, it is clear that this does not allow the European Union to reach the path of well-being. Let us therefore assume that the Framework has failed and assume that we need legal reform. Many groups have been calling for Parliament to call for legal reform of the Framework to open up a perspective on many things that are currently essential, whether it is having its own budgetary capacity, strong enough taxation, a revision of the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact, what kind of reforms we are doing and the debt issue. It is timid very much the reference on the question of debt in the report and we know that we have a serious problem, even though there are many groups that have made amendments in this regard so that there is a reference. And I would like to say that, in some of these things, this report is a step backwards, because on debt and other issues we have had, for example, in the Troika report of the previous mandate, much more advanced references. I therefore believe that, at the moment, my group cannot support this report and I would also like to say - and I do this as a call to all Members on the left of this Parliament - that it is not putting a couple of commas in an absolutely ideological neoliberal framework, which is not ours, as we must move forward.

The only concern of the report, which we will vote against, is the failure to respect the current framework of economic governance and not the devastating repercussions that austerity policies and the obsession with budgetary constraints have had on the European economy and citizens.  By making a mistake, of course, the cure is also wrong. The aim of the report is to strengthen the existing rules and enforce them, without in any way questioning the need to immediately review the treaties and rules, austerity policies and absurd and unsustainable budgetary constraints. We do not see the vital need to increase flexibility for public investment by exempting it from deficit and debt calculations. We do not look at the macroeconomic imbalances generated by the single currency. There is no roadmap that proposes real solutions to break with the bankruptcy strategy adopted so far, an impossible compromise between those who persist in stating, against all the evidence, that Europe needs more austerity, stricter budgetary constraints, lower wages and less welfare state, and those who, in the election campaign, proclaimed that they wanted to change course and change the existing rules because they were unsustainable and now do not have the political strength to fulfil that commitment.  And I appeal to the Socialists, who have a political commitment to respect with their electors: with this report they absolutely cannot respect it. You have taken millions of votes for change and the fight against austerity and now you support these positions. We have tabled an alternative motion for a resolution to increase the fiscal area and productive investment and to enable the Member States to face up to the problems that we are facing now, namely unemployment and poverty. If we do not solve these problems, Europe will not go ahead. We need to review the budgetary rules, therefore, and above all introduce a withdrawal clause from the eurozone, extending the opt-out granted to some countries to allow all Member States to choose their currency democratically and therefore monetary policy.

Why? Because a previous weakening of the rules had led to Member States living beyond their means, delays in reforms and delays in the future. At that time, we ended up in the very debt spiral that decisively fuelled the economic and financial crisis. That is why strengthening economic governance in 2011 was so important and right. That is why we are firmly opposed to a role backwards. That is why we do not accept any softening of the rules. We agree with the own-initiative report that has been presented only because it makes it clear that no legislative changes are required. That is our clear message to the Commission. And the Commission is being asked to apply the existing rules, with the possibilities and within the clear limits that the rules set equally for all Member States. National responsibility and participation must be given greater prominence. Europe cannot be the scapegoat for wrong decisions that lie within the national competence. We very much welcome the fact that the rules were extended in 2011 to include the procedures on macroeconomic imbalances. Contrary to legend, macroeconomic imbalances arise within Member States. An early discovery of such imbalances and their correction through structural reforms is a prerequisite for preventing future sovereign-debt crises. Economic and monetary union must become more resilient. But this can only be done if we look bluntly at the cause of today's crisis.

First of all, yes, we need a reform agenda, but a reform agenda turned to the future, building on a competitive turn to the future, and supporting advanced social standards; and yes, we need to have a powerful investment initiative. We now have EFSI, but we need to build a fiscal capacity supporting Member States in what they can no longer do, because they are committed to a common fiscal discipline. More than that, we need a proper economic coordination of our policies based on the fiscal stance and reducing the macroeconomic imbalances we have, which are undermining the total growth we can achieve as a continent. Finally, we need to bring more democracy to all these decisions and to give a stronger role to the European Parliament.

Many of the reform measures are subject to national competence, and that is why there must be such a combination. I believe that both reports go into a development that makes clear the decisions we have taken so far, which we have with Sixpack and much more, that there is an internal link between fiscal soundness and structural reforms. Structural reforms are the condition for growth to emerge. Growth can only be done with competitive structures.

The house of straw is the euro of the Maastricht Treaty. The idea was excellent, but the implementation was not yet very resilient. The second piglet builds his house out of wood, which is already more stable. This is the euro with the ESM, with the banking union. But also with the very complicated rules of the two- and the six-pack. In our picture one can imagine the new rules as very complicated cross-measures within the house, which should make the house more stable. Unfortunately, they also make the house a bit uninhabitable. You have to be constantly afraid that you stumble over a strut in the house or stumble on it. What do you not do to be prepared against the wolf in the wooden house!

Well, what it seems is that these Members forget that here are people who represent the voters and therefore have the right to speak out and give influence to their constituents.

All that was left was that center-left voters and left-wing voters had more rights than center-right voters who, on top of that, cast more votes for the center-right than the center-left and the left.

Secondly, I think that this report, as it appears after the negotiation, is going in the right direction, which is the meaning that we have had here.

Mr President, so-called economic governance leads to the de facto imposition of a state of emergency not foreseen by the European Treaties. European institutions behave as if the rules on excessive budget deficits take precedence over rules that guarantee fundamental and, in particular, social rights. However, the European institutions themselves undermine the basis of the European Union, namely respect for people's fundamental rights.

Obviously, there's a problem here. I know that there are many groups that are raising this question because they want a much stricter application of the rules of the Covenant; But you know what's going on? the problem is that, in many circumstances, the rules go against one's own objectives and are often unfulfillable. I therefore believe that there is also a whole reflection here to make on the extent to which the flexibility incorporated by the Stability and Growth Pact itself is sufficient or not, because, in recent years, what has happened is that flexibility has simply been used to be able to legalize de facto situations; that is, when a state no longer complied with the rules, flexibility allowed that legal vacuum to be filled. But of course that is not done for that and, in any event, obviously with the Commission's Flexibility Notice, we hope that this can improve. For us, equally and obviously, the rules must be clear. The Commission must explain exactly how it applies these criteria and, therefore, we are also interested in asking it some questions, for example what methodology is used to develop its economic analyses within the framework of the Covenant itself. That's a very important issue. And, if the Commission can explain, too, its choice between a downward or an upward economic analysis when assessing the reform efforts of the Member States.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start with a premise and an analysis which, although it is not mine, I fully agree with.  In December, I gave all my colleagues a short but well-considered essay in which a university professor and former Italian minister, Professor Guarino, listed many reasons and causes of the current crisis in Europe. One of these causes lies precisely in the adoption of the Stability and Growth Pact which, in fact, imposes absurd budgetary constraints on the Member States and clashes with the growth objectives laid down in the European Treaties.  This regulation sets as a medium-term objective for the Member States a budgetary situation involving a balance close to balance or in surplus. In practice, the possibility of indebtedness has been removed, which in crisis situations such as today's is the only viable option.  The Stability and Growth Pact, followed by its revision, six-pack and two-pack, ending with the fiscal compact, denied the possibility of growth and development for the Member States, with the sole objective of balancing the budget, which alone is by no means a guarantee of growth and development. All this, in addition, in complete contradiction to the provisions of the European Treaties, the maximum source of EU law, which clearly indicate the possibility for a state to be able to borrow for growth purposes within the limits provided for by the excessive deficit procedure.  I would therefore like to ask the Commission how it interprets this blatant contradiction and whether it intends to take any action to resolve this issue. What I understand very clearly, however, is that the rules can be interpreted according to the interests on the ground or the political will, because when these European rules were violated by France or Germany, they gladly turned a blind eye, if not two, as continues to be the case with the problem of overrunning Germany's trade surplus on GDP.

I would like to ask the Commission why there are any lessons they have learned or will once again make up arguments against facts. Secondly, is the Commission available to shift the focus, to recognise that austerity has completely failed and to stop using debt as an excuse, ignoring that in some cases, even in cases where adjustment programmes such as Ireland have been implemented, for example, it was not public debt but private debt that was at the root of the problem? In the SGP review, is the Commission available to start monitoring surpluses as well?  I must confess that I am absolutely outraged by the Commission's lack of rigour in applying the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact itself against excessive surpluses when it is then very strict in monitoring and punishing excessive deficits. Will the Commission continue to have double standards, turn a blind eye to rich countries that are in breach of the SGP and commit itself to punishing countries in difficulty, or will it finally remove sanctions that are absolutely unacceptable from the SGP?

First of all, thank you for inviting me to speak on this important issue: transparency in the application of the Stability and Growth Pact.  The Stability and Growth Pact is essential for the functioning of the European Union. It forms a rules-based framework that promotes sound budgetary policies and the sustainability of public finances throughout the European Union. When assessing member states' budgets, these rules leave the European Commission and the Council sufficient discretion and the possibility to take account of the specific circumstances of each country, so that safe, independent and reliable assessments of the economic situation are essential for the functioning of the system. These important aspects are also mentioned in the report on economic governance by The Member, Mr Berès, who was discussed a short time ago.  In this context, I would like to highlight the significant improvements that have been made in economic policy coordination in recent years. I think it is safe to say that the new institutional framework set out in the Pact strengthens the Commission's role and right of initiative. The new rules also increase member states' accountability and transparency of processes. All process-related documents are publicly available on the European Commission's website, and the new approach also allows for a more robust and comprehensive assessment of the various possible economic factors in the Member States and in the European Union as a whole. The Council bases its discussions on an independent analysis of the economic situation prepared by the European Commission, for example in staff working documents and forecasts. We also use information provided by the Member States concerned in the Council, in particular on new or additional discretionary policy measures, if it implements such measures. The positions of the Member States are then discussed and, ultimately, an agreement is reached with a view to ensuring the necessary result, a stable and sustainable fiscal position. The same approach was also followed in assessing the situation and deciding on the application of the excessive budgetary procedure to France. Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. This year's economic policy coordination cycle, or three priorities of the European Semester, is, firstly, to encourage investment, secondly, to implement structural reforms and, thirdly, to develop responsible fiscal policies. In other words, although the importance of fiscal accountability is invaluable, it is nevertheless only one of the necessary elements. The importance of structural reforms and investments, alongside responsible fiscal policies, is also underlined in the Commission Communication on the application of the principle of flexibility in the Stability and Growth Pact.  The Council has exchanged views on this communication and found a common demper to make use of the flexibility provided for in the existing rules. The Council continues its work towards a common understanding of the application of the principle of flexibility. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the role of the Stability and Growth Pact in the wider context, its role in improving Europe's economic and monetary union. On 24 October 2014, the European Summit set the task of preparing the next steps for better economic governance in the euro area, and an early report by five presidents on the development of Europe's economic and monetary union was published on 22 June this year. It offers a gradual approach to strengthening Europe's economic and monetary union in the short term and to improving the long-term structure of European economic and monetary union. Tomorrow's European Council provides for the first exchange of views on the five Presidents' report, and the Council is ready to work constructively on the issues outlined in the report in all the appropriate formats.  As I said in today's debate on preparations for the European Council, it is essential to make every effort to promote convergence, because the differences currently existing between the Member States of the euro area may jeopardise the future of the Union as a whole. We are ready to work constructively to implement the proposals contained in the report, and the Guidelines of the European Council will play an important role in this process.  Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. I sincerely believe that we will be able to achieve a common vision of the future of Europe's economic and monetary union and will also be able to implement it.

Certainly things can be improved upon. But let me start by illustrating what is already in place. I will start by talking about transparency and then move to the scrutiny part. As you know, the work of budgetary surveillance by the Commission is based on its economic and fiscal forecasts. The Commission provides and publishes regular country-specific AA, EA and EU-level analysis of the economic perspectives. In addition the Commission produces, once a year, country reports that contain a comprehensive analysis of the economic situation, including in-depth reviews under the Macroeconomic Imbalances Procedure, where relevant, and an assessment of the main challenges. Concerning, in particular, fiscal surveillance, the assessments of the Commission are accompanied by detailed technical analysis prepared by the services, which are also made public. All the relevant results and documents are publicly available on the Commission’s website. Thus, all the elements needed to perform the Commission’s analysis and calculations are publicly available. We can certainly further improve and facilitate access to this amount of information, and I thank you for having brought the issue to our attention. In this connection I am glad to announce that we are planning a new version of a public Commission staff document on the rules of the Stability and Growth Package, the so-called Vademecum. In this document we will clarify even more the methodology that we use to assess whether the Member States, under the excessive deficit procedure, have taken the action required by the Council. This is the technical component of the analysis, which has then to be validated by the College. At the moment, all results and methodologies, including detailed information, top-down and bottom-up approaches, can be found in the relevant documents available on the Commission’s website. But we are aware of the need for further clarification and we will act decisively in this sense. When we are looking at Commission decision-making, the judgements and decisions taken by the College are certainly political, but they are based on independent analysis of the relevant facts and the applicable rules. In this respect the Commission cannot change the 3% deficit rule and the 60% debt rule of the Stability and Growth Pact, which are enshrined in the Treaty, of which the Commission remains the guardian. The Commission document on Flexibility is just an interpretative communication which provides additional guidance for the implementation of the Stability and Growth Pact, without ordering the rules themselves. Indeed, due to the complexity of the facts to be determined and of the economic analysis to be performed, the SGP provisions leave a substantial margin of appreciation to the Commission and to the Council. With the aim of providing transparency and predictability, it is therefore in the Commission’s remit to provide further interpretation of the Stability and Growth Pact provisions without changing or replacing them. Rules for sound public finances, of which the Stability and Growth Pact is an expression, are necessary for the existence of the monetary union and, more in general, for sustainable growth. They are even more important now that growth is coming back and we need to avoid repeating past errors. The Commission improved the surveillance cycle by presenting the economic analysis in country reports three months earlier than in the past. The Commission is also currently engaging in a dialogue with the European Parliament and the Council in the context of the so-called two- and six-pack review, and five presidents, including the European Parliament President, are discussing the future of EMU, including its governance mechanism. Honourable Members, as a conclusion, the Commission is committed to improving the surveillance framework. Our desire is to take this way all together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 240, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Dariusz ROSATI", "mepid": "28394", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, the Stability and Growth Pact is an important instrument for ensuring fiscal discipline in the Member States.

I am very happy to hear Commissioner Katainen promise to improve the transparency and efficiency of the Stability and Growth Pact. One way, or one avenue, to improve the situation would perhaps be to consider adding to the existing main measure of fiscal discipline – which is, of course, the deficit – some other measures, such as for instance debt-to-GDP ratio. The deficit measure, be it in the form of a headline deficit or a structural deficit, suffers from important weaknesses. One of them is that the deficit gives us a short-term picture of the budgetary situation and actually is not a good measure of long-term sustainability in terms of fiscal policy. The other thing is that the deficit is very much dependent on cyclical factors, ad hoc measures and also discretionary policy measures taken by individual governments. The structural deficit is mostly a variable which is not directly observable and is also dependent on the potential output, which is again a concept that is difficult to measure and difficult to present in a convincing way. So maybe one possibility of improving the situation would be simply to shift to the debt-to-GDP ratio.

We heard all the different opinions from the latest speaker, who said basically that there should not be any rules in the economy, and then we heard somebody who said that our rules have been too loose and should be strengthened, or the rules should be a bit more strict. But the topic of the day was transparency of the application of the Stability and Growth Pact. This is a very important topic. Many people have said that the rules have not been transparent enough, and lots of questions have been raised about whether the interpretation of the rules is right. Some have been saying that the Commission’s interpretation has been too loose and we should have been stricter, and someone has said that we have been too strict and it should be been looser. That is why we have to pay attention to transparency, because everybody should understand what the rules mean. If there is a lack of clarity about what the rules mean, then the rules are under criticism from different directions. Of course, now, when we are concentrating on the Five Presidents’ report, we can also assess how to further develop our rule base. I would, as a personal opinion, say that most of it should concentrate on implementation of our rules. As I said earlier, the Commission has interpreted the current Stability and Growth Pact in a very flexible way, but one whereby we can still say clearly that we have stayed within the Stability and Growth Pact. One of the issues to which we have not paid that much attention in the past is the structural side of our economy. It is not only about deficit or debt level, but it is also about strengths or weaknesses of our structures. So I would like to turn our focus more to the structural side of our economies, because, when looking at the countries in trouble, their problems have been much more structural in nature than cyclical. That is why the Stability and Growth Pact should be seen as an entity, not only as a framework of rules which look at whether the deficit is 0.2% higher or lower; it also should focus more on the structural side of our economy. Madam President, I want to thank everyone once more for a very lively and very good discussion.

Commissioner, i would like to begin by thanking the Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. I thank you for this debate. Firstly, they showed how important it is for all of us to have a stable fiscal situation throughout the European Union, to ensure that conditions are sustainable and that contribute to the implementation of the Union's programme for jobs and growth.  After years of stagnation, Europe is in desperate need of growth and this can be ensured by the simultaneous implementation of all three priorities: fiscal responsibility, just as investments and structural reforms.  I cannot share the view that the Stability and Growth Pact has failed. The report by the five presidents, which we have already mentioned many times today, also confirms the importance of fiscal responsibility and financial sustainability and the central role of the Stability and Growth Pact in ensuring market credibility.  In the long term, this provides for the possibility of redistribution of public finance risks, but in order to achieve this objective, a number of preconditions must be met: firstly, significant economic convergence must be achieved, secondly, financial market integration must be ensured and, thirdly, fiscal rules must be respected. It is equally important that The Member States must express their determination to move towards closer integration.  As a last but not least, precondition, I would like to stress the need to promote and strengthen respect for political responsibility and legitimacy. To achieve all this, we will need closer involvement from national parliaments, the European Parliament and the social partners. This means that we all still have a lot of work to do together.  Honourable Members, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for his excellent work. To conclude this debate, which is indeed the last debate of the Latvian Presidency in the European Parliament, I would like to express my great gratitude for our very productive cooperation, for all the discussions that we have held here and for all the decisions that we have been able to take for the future of the European Union and for the benefit of our citizens.

The Commission must play the role of an independent budgetary controller in order for our Economic and Monetary Union to be credible in the future. Ensuring the stability and sustainability of the European economic system is necessary and immediate in order to re-enter the path of growth and jobs. The rules of the Stability Pact should apply in all countries in the same way. An independent economic assessment must be carried out transparently and efficiently, and I am therefore pleased with the assurances given by Commissioner Katainen. We need to ensure a responsible fiscal policy and bring about convergence of our financial markets. It is also important to strengthen political legitimacy, which is why Parliament should show greater commitment. What methods are used by the European Commission to analyse the economic framework?

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission adopted its action plan for fairer and more efficient corporate taxation a week ago. That is why I am honoured to come and present to you our initiatives to upgrade corporate taxation in the internal market.  The package adopted in March dealt with tax transparency. Today, our scope of action is broader. We aim to fundamentally reform the corporate tax framework in Europe to make it fairer, more efficient and more conducive to growth and jobs. The inadequacy of EU rules on corporate taxation has made taxation an area for which the single market remains to be built. Today, the juxtaposition of twenty-eight different tax systems is ineffective and counterproductive. Ineffective, because in many cases Member States are not able to collect the tax that should be theirs, which dries up their revenues and affects their stability. Counterproductive because the proliferation, complexity and variety of standards that apply within the internal market often discourage companies from expanding beyond their national borders. We can no longer tolerate some companies, often the most successful, freeing themselves from their fair contribution to tax and that some tax systems encourage them to do so. Corporate taxation in Europe is unfair, because it amounts to a higher tax burden on citizens and other businesses. This is socially unacceptable. More fundamentally, unfair taxation jeopardizes consent to tax. Finally, this situation is contrary to our objectives, because abusive practices and the race for the lowest tax burden undermine pro-growth tax policies and create distortions within the single market. This last point is particularly important to me. Our fight against tax evasion is not a fight against business. On the contrary, the majority of European companies will benefit from our action, since it is both a question of preventing their less scrupulous competitors from gaining an unfair advantage and of refocusing tax policies on job creation and investment.  The framework in place today has aged terribly. We rely on rules developed in the 1930s to regulate the business environment of the twentieth century. At the international level, the OECD is working to update the international framework for corporate taxation. This is an extremely welcome initiative, actively supported by the Union. But we cannot rely solely on international standards, we must develop our own solutions for the single market in order to take into account its specificities.  The European Union needs a common and coherent approach to corporate tax reform, which raises a major obstacle along the way: the traditional reluctance of Member States to work together on this issue. Indeed, they often tackle tax challenges on their own. Many of them see Community action in this area as a threat to their sovereignty, in reality it is the other way around. It is when states exhaust themselves to prevent the erosion of their tax base in the face of elusive profits rather than to develop fiscal policies that meet their needs that sovereignty is compromised. Fortunately, we are witnessing an awareness in the Member States. They need to completely rethink their approach to corporate taxation if they want businesses to pay their fair share of taxes, if they want sustainable tax systems to be conducive to growth, if they want an attractive single market for business and investment. In these circumstances, if they want to restore their ability to democratically determine the amount of taxes to be paid, Member States have no choice but to cooperate. That is what we are proposing to them with the action plan adopted last week.  Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, we will first relaunch the project of a consolidated common corporate tax base.  THE CCCTB can both make life a meaningful easier for businesses, thus encouraging investment and job creation, preventing tax evasion and protecting our single market. The idea is simple: in a single market, a single tax for companies that have a European dimension. This will be the end of a clutter of rules incompatible with each other and their procession of overlaps, differences in interpretation, legal loopholes, multiple, and sometimes contradictory, obligations, and ensuing challenges. Although discussions in the Council are deadlocked, this Parliament, Member States, businesses and other stakeholders are in favour of reviving this project. That is why the Commission will review its proposal and adjust it so that the discussions can get back on a good footing, and I hope to succeed. We intend to propose a mandatory ACCIS, at least for multinationals, because an optional system will not stop tax evasion. We will propose a step-by-step approach because the CSRAC, as proposed, was too ambitious for us to reach an immediate agreement. Preparatory work has already begun and the Commission intends to present you with an amended proposal as soon as possible next year.  But we cannot wait for the adoption of the ICSA by the Council to deal with the problems of corporate taxation, which is why our action plan includes a number of measures to be implemented immediately.  The effective taxation of profits within the single market is a burning issue. It is no longer acceptable for some multinationals that make large profits in the European Union to pay almost no tax. Businesses have to pay their fair share of taxes where they make a profit. To ensure this, some Member States have unilaterally adopted anti-abuse provisions. However, acting in scattered order on these issues risks creating more problems than solving them. That is why our action plan lays the groundwork for a common approach to effective taxation to ensure that profits generated in the Union are taxed there. This includes filling the legal loopholes, framing preferential regimes, reviewing the issue of transfer pricing, or coordinating anti-abuse provisions. Similarly, we are trying to put in place greater transparency. The tax transparency package, which we proposed last March, is progressing well. I am counting on you, I am counting on this Parliament to support it. Last week, we went even further by launching a public consultation on a country-by-country reporting system to make transparency about the activities of multinationals in different countries and the taxes they pay there. Transparency must also go beyond the European Union, particularly with regard to the least cooperative states and territories. Some Member States have established lists of tax havens, others have not. Some have retaliatory measures in place, others have not. This disorderly approach is not effective in discouraging tax predation by some countries outside the European Union.  By acting as a bloc, the European Union would have much more clout to fend off attacks on tax bases. To this end, the Commission has published a coordinated list of the 30 least cooperative states and territories, based on the national lists of Member States. The clarity provided by this coordinated list will enable work on a common approach of the European Union and will encourage the countries concerned to redouble their efforts to better cooperate.  Ladies and gentlemen, it is through this package of measures - the CGTA for the medium term, effective taxation, greater transparency and closer cooperation between Member States in the immediate future - that we intend to make corporate taxation an instrument of economic policy for growth and employment in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 262, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Alain LAMASSOURE", "mepid": "1204", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, a big thank you to the informants and journalists. Thanks to them, all European citizens have learned that at the very moment when taxes are rising for many of them, some of the largest companies are able to evade a large part of their profits from taxation. The problem arises on two levels and in different ways. First of all, between us in the Union, I would say that it is a question of family solidarity. As you have said very well, Commissioner, in a unified economic space, 28 all moral but different laws lead to the height of immorality. We must ban any system that would allow some to steal the tax wealth of their neighbours. The solution is known. The laxity of the common definition of taxable profit, which you have mentioned and which you are familiar with, Commissioner, must be addressed, since you were rapporteur in this Parliament on the draft already presented in 2011.  Then there is the global level. The principles of transparency, loyalty and fairness must apply to tax competition as well as to all other types of competition. Faced with this situation, the elected representatives that we are have an obligation to achieve results. Parliament understood this by creating the special committee TAXE. The European Commission has understood this by presenting this first package of measures, which I would like to welcome, and which my group, Madam, will support. But it will all depend on the political will of the rulers.  I say it quite clearly, taxation is too important a subject to be left to the finance ministers alone. Left to their own devices, they will accept everything and apply nothing. It is at the summit level that action must be taken. The European Council must address this before the end of the year.

It's another step, still insufficient, but in the right direction in relation to the LuxLeaks scandal in response to the LuxLeaks scandal. In fact, it is not acceptable for some countries that violently control the budgets of others by imposing brutal spending cuts on them, to be the same as every day they steal tax revenues through aggressive and unfair practices.  This situation is unfair, it is politically unsustainable. For years, the Socialist Group has been calling for the establishment of ccctb, i.e. a common basis for calculating the consolidated and compulsory tax base for all companies in the Union. Without this common basis, tax rates cannot be compared.  We regret that the C of \"consolidation\" has been left out for now, apparently out of the proposals, because without certainty about transfer prices the fight against erosion of tax bases is weakened. We also regret that the obligation to report, country by country, of the accounts of companies, the so-called Country by Country Reporting, is postponed pending a feasibility study that was not at all necessary.  One question I ask: what can we do, as representatives of citizens overwhelmed by brutal tax burdens so that Europe can move faster on a tax justice agenda, where competition is done between businesses and not between states.  I am complied with by this proposal for the work it is doing, but can you assure, dear Commissioner Marianne Thyssen, that, following Juncker's political commitment, the whole college of Commissioners, not just a few Commissioners, will be united in a convergent, coherent and ambitious position, capable of moving the Council of Ministers, usually blocked by the unanimity rule?

I understand and share the concerns of EU citizens when it comes to large companies avoiding tax, but the EU should not delude itself that the multinational companies can be brought into a fair taxation framework via a single piece of EU legislation. It may be a sad reality, but it is a reality that people try to lower their tax contributions, and often that will mean locating activities in low-tax jurisdictions. That means companies may relocate outside of the EU to lower their tax contributions, and there is very little that the EU can do about it. There is a reason why the UK Government has led the tax reform agenda at the G7 and G20. If we want corporations to pay their fair share, we need to work collectively at the level of the OECD, so that as many countries as possible work together to solve this problem. If countries all legislate at a national level, wherever in the developed world a company may be located, our problem on tax is resolved. The Member States need to show leadership within the OECD and in particular press for stronger transfer pricing and permanent establishment rules to ensure companies pay the appropriate level of tax in the countries where they earn their profits. All Member States individually should now take the necessary steps for early adoption of the OECD country-by-country reporting, which will help tax authorities to spot avoidance and make sure that companies pay what they owe. Closer cooperation amongst EU tax authorities and their global partners will ensure that opportunities to avoid tax become fewer.  The EU legislative process on VAT took 10 years to negotiate and then a further 10 years to implement. A legislative route on the common corporate tax base is not an efficient way of solving the issue of corporate taxation. The easiest and fastest way to address the issue of corporate tax is to agree a solution at the OECD and then implement that solution urgently in national law.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 265, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Michael THEURER", "mepid": "96871", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to take a iendled with the ALDE Group. Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done.

We therefore had to act here, and I am glad that Parliament has now set up the special committee that I called for for the ALDE Group back in November. Our expert hearings and on-site visits clearly show a need for action. Firstly, there is a competition issue. Experts reckon that these aggressive tax avoidance schemes by large corporations are the disadvantage for small and medium-sized enterprises at 20-25%. It is not acceptable for large corporations to pay less than one percent tax on billions in sales. But what is the right answer to this situation? The Commission has put forward proposals that we welcome: on the one hand, the automatic exchange of information – a minimum requirement. And we learned from a visit to Switzerland, where there is tax competition between the cantons, that a common tax base is also important, because then there is competition over the different tax rates and no longer through an erosion of the tax base. But we also see that our tax models are coming under pressure in a globalised, digitised global economy as a whole. And here we say that we need an area of tax justice and fair tax competition within the European Union. We also need solutions for the so-called patent boxes, in other words for the deductibility of licences and interest.

We discovered that Member States had been secretly agreeing deals with multinational corporations to allow them to avoid tax. Corporations were playing a game of divide and conquer with EU governments, and the losers were the people of Europe. It was only because of the actions of the brave whistleblower Antoine Deltour that we found out about this. The Commission had looked the other way. In spite of President Juncker’s promises to act, it was clear that this was through desperation rather than desire, and the outcomes have been disappointing. To explore the issue of Member State collusion in tax avoidance, a special committee was set up, and last week we visited London. I must confess I was shocked by the murky and elaborate system of relationships between my capital city and offshore secrecy jurisdictions, where money can be hidden and tax avoided. I think we all have to admit that our countries are involved in these activities that hurt us all and distort the single market. I welcome the Commission’s list of tax havens as a first step to map this hidden world, although there is much further to go. Two of the clear demands of the Green Group are that corporations should be required to make public how much economic substance is created in which country – so-called country-by-country reporting – and that there should be agreement about how and where corporations are taxed: the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base, or CCCTB. These are the minimum requirements we need to prevent countries shifting their profits in the interests of shareholders while depriving the public of the taxes that are necessary to pay for the roads and internet systems the companies use, the schools that educate their staff and the hospitals those staff use when they are ill. We already have country-by-country reporting for banks, so it is a simple matter to extend this to other sectors. So do we find this in the Commission’s tax package? I am afraid to say we do not. Instead, we have merely a viability study: a classic example of delaying tactics. Next time we meet as a Parliament in Strasbourg, we will have the chance to vote on this vital transparency proposal, and I sincerely hope we will pass it with a large majority. As for the CCCTB, the Commission is promising to relaunch its proposal, beginning with the common part, so that we all agree what should be taxed.

The Commission has presented us with its action plan to put the LuxLeaks scandal to the fore. However, I recall that the President of the Commission is Jean-Claude Juncker, and he is the main architect of these practices of siphoning off the tax revenue of his European partners for the benefit of Luxembourg. This simple reminder should make us doubt the sincerity or the true purposes of this initiative.  On today's proposal, the aim is certainly laudable: to remove an incentive for aggressive tax optimisation, in line with the OECD's fifteen proposals. States would retain control of rates and profits would remain localized in the country where real economic activity is located.  There remains the question of localization criteria, particularly for the digital economy. But the proponents of federal Europe could take today's consensus as an alibi to give a boost to the fiscal union, which would go far beyond that. The AXIS project already plans to consolidate all profits and losses across the European Union. Secondly, when it comes to VAT, Brussels is already imposing a framework on rates on states. France knows something about catering and books.  What will be left of fiscal sovereignty in the long run? Will this logic of integration in progress lead the Union to raise its own tax? Will there be a gradual transfer of national budgets to THE Union's budgets so that the last lock, that of unanimity, can finally be skipped?

Mr President, the Commission is proposing a package of measures on tax transparency. Let us first pass on the irony of the fact that the President of the Commission is Mr Juncker, former Prime Minister of Luxembourg, capital of tax avoidance in the Union. In fact, the package is nothing more than an air wish list, full of intelligent definitions with countless loopholes in which large companies aim to continue to avoid tax and to place more tax burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises, which are not networked like multinationals.  The Commission's view is ultimately doomed to fail, as have so many other regulations and provisions, which have achieved nothing more than to turn the Union into a labyrinth of bureaucracy hostile to both healthy and legitimate entrepreneurs and suffering workers. One could expect nothing more than a Union of protectors of Siemens and the other multinationals, who are proven to be illegal but continue to enjoy immunity.  One may be the solution to all this. A clear and secure investment environment that will remain stable for many years to come. As long as we have a single market with different tax rates in each Member State, the phenomenon of tax avoidance will never be eliminated.

In this respect, it is important that the European Commission now takes a first major step forward with the Action Plan. It is important that we achieve a uniform tax base for corporation tax. However, it is very important that, in addition to the tax base, we also achieve consolidation within Europe, and we support the Commission in all its efforts to make progress in a timely manner. Country-by-country reporting so we know who pays taxes where is important. We therefore welcome the fact that the first steps have been taken here with a public consultation.

Madam President, it is well known that in order for economic growth in a country, there must be investments in that country, facilitated by the existence of a legal tax system. The need for such a system also exists in the European Union, where, due to the free movement of products, many multinational companies are active at European and global level. That is why we have previously discussed the Commission's plan for a fair tax system to replace the existing one. With this plan, the European Union seeks to create a fair and secure business environment, distinguished by transparency and the ability to support companies that are consistent with their tax obligations.  However, the following question arises. How can a tax system be fair, which does not take into account the tax specificities and problems that companies in the crisis-affected countries have? How is it possible, for example, in Greece for institutions, or the troika as we used to say, to require Greek companies to pay 29% VAT while at the same time requiring them to be efficient and to make profits? On the other hand, the European Union does not want to intervene, and that is why we must accept that we must put aside hypocrisy and find and admit that unfortunately this tax system is not fair.

Taxes are levied differently, just as the Member States design their social systems differently. The Member States themselves know best who they are taxing, for what and how much. That is why the EU should not interfere with tax competences. Nevertheless, we in Europe need to act, namely when multinationals take advantage of the different systems of our taxes, when they undermine the tax base for tax collection, when they write invoices for so long within the group, until belgium, the Netherlands or the United Kingdom have hardly any tax to pay – to name but a few countries, where, unfortunately, this is a common place. The Commission is taking action against this, which I very much welcome. We therefore need a common tax base for corporation tax in the European Union, we need a much more binding exchange of information between the national tax authorities, we need country-by-country reporting. And we need – and I think this is very important – a stronger naming and shaming of the Member States that oppose it. Taxes must be paid where companies produce and where they provide their services. What is self-evident for the craftsman at home must become a duty for the large corporations in Europe.

The first big hole, as many have mentioned, is the lack of a commitment to public country-by-country reporting. Unfortunately this has been unnecessarily postponed. We must see it being enacted soon. There is also no mention of protections for whistle-blowers, and whilst a common list of tax havens is better than nothing at all, we surely need a common definition of tax havens to give that list credibility. Furthermore there must be consequences for those countries and firms which are classified as tax havens or which use tax havens. They should not be able to profit from EU funds. Finally, I am sorry to say that I do harbour some doubts about the Commission’s proposed loss adjustment mechanism. A 2011 OECD report indicated how, and I quote, ‘financial instruments are used to create artificial losses, i.e. losses which are only generated for tax purposes’.

Such tax evasion is not acceptable, and therefore it is good to see that the Commission is relaunching its action plan for fair and efficient corporate taxation. I think one of the questions that we need to answer is: how much can the EU do on its own, and how much should we do in conjunction with the OECD, for example through its BEPS project, which needs to be fully implemented? The EU can and should take action. But I think it is crucial to remember that a global approach is also necessary in parallel with our own action plan. Transparency should be core to our efforts, and I hope this Parliament will vote for country-by-country reporting when it gets the opportunity to do so at the next Strasbourg part-session. Commissioner Thyssen, you said that the Commission is going back to the drawing board on CCCTB, and I think this is necessary due to the complexity of some of the earlier proposals. I think the crucial issue for small Member States in CCCTB will be how the formula is found to apportion the share of profits. Previous formulae were based on sales, employment and capital investment, and they favoured large countries over smaller countries. So I think that formula needs to be nuanced.

I am a bit bored of hearing all the blame about companies using aggressive tax avoidance and tax planning if we have offered it to them on a gold plate, even with private agreements, and then again with a system that encourages the use of a different kind of transfer pricing systems and different kinds of tax levels and tax accounting methods. Let us stop thinking that if we can compete within the family and beat other Member States with this kind of tax advantage, then it benefits those who think that it would be to their advantage, because we are all losing on this policy. We are losing up to EUR 1 000 billion every year because of bad tax systems, tax avoidance and non-taxation. Let us put an end to that. Madam Commissioner, I congratulate you on these proposals, which you know so well from your history, on the common corporate tax base.

Firstly, the Commission is doing half the work by omwing the consolidation of profits and losses. If we want to guarantee that companies pay tax where they make a profit, that possibility must not disappear under the table. Secondly, the Commission is doing half the work in dealing with tax havens. Yes, the blacklist of tax havens is welcome, but the real question is how to deal with these tax havens. The Netherlands, my country, is a transit port of untaxed profits. I would therefore strongly advocate that a withholding tax on flows to these tax havens should be allowed under European directives. Thirdly, the European Union must also support the forthcoming OECD agreements by implementing them quickly. There is little to nothing about this in the action plan.

The action plan presented by the European Commission is very ambitious, but also much needed. Whether it is implemented will depend on the Member States and it will be their attitude that will determine the creation of a fairer corporate tax system in the Union.  The main problem in the current situation is, inter alia, the lack of a level playingmatch for economic operators. If multinationals pay on average 30% less tax than domestic companies, it is difficult to expect the latter to win competition. Therefore, the action plan presented can be seen as an instrument for rebalancing the single market. A number of initiatives aimed at combating tax avoidance, ensuring stable incomes and strengthening the single market for businesses deserve support. Taken together, these measures are intended to significantly improve the conditions for corporate taxation in the European Union, which will become fairer, more efficient and more growth-promoting.  I am convinced that if we succeed, albeit to some extent, in reducing the grey area and improving the enforcement of taxes on the budgets of the Member States, and thus of the European Union, there will be significant measures to make the investments necessary, even from the point of view of labour markets.  One of the most difficult tasks facing the European Parliament and the Council will be to work on a proposal to create a common consolidated corporate tax base. The previous attempt to adopt this instrument was not a complete success, thanks to a number of reservations from the Member States. If an agreement on this issue is to be successful, the European Commission will have to take into account the problems raised by the Members of the Union, but also by Parliament, and reach a satisfactory compromise for all.  It seems that the proposal to create a common tax base for companies without the need for consolidation is a solution going in the right direction. There is no doubt that, after a period of tightening the belt and a thrifty fiscal policy, it is time to support economic operators.

It is actually a very important day-to-day issue which we need to see from three different perspectives. These three different perspectives can be in terms of continuity, efficiency and competitiveness. Speaking of continuity, the action plan on corporate taxation is part and parcel of a growth agenda which President Juncker has been implementing with determination since November last year. It is no coincidence that taxation falls within plenary debates such as the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI) and the Stability and Growth Pact. Looking at the bigger picture, it reminds us that taxation  rules can be combined and complemented by other initiatives at EU level to bring the best possible results. Importantly, initiatives such as the digital agenda and the use of new technologies can aid the transparent collection and control of tax contributions. Just to give a quick example: in Estonia, 95% of tax declarations are filled in electronically and the process takes about five minutes. It is so much easier for businesses and saves so much time which is not spent on queuing but actually on doing business. This brings me to efficiency, which requires clear uniform rules. As in most areas of taxation, it is best to keep things simple. The more exceptions and specific regulations there are, the more loopholes can be created. These loopholes can be exploited by the most skilled players and are often to the disadvantage of SMEs. This brings me to my last point: competitiveness. With continuity and efficiency, we can also support competitiveness for our companies, which will do business in a much more clearly-regulated environment. This is crucial for SMEs.

This subject, for a country such as my own country, Italy, takes on politically very important characteristics. As you know, the level of taxation, especially for businesses, in a developed country like mine has reached unbearable levels. We are talking about peaks of more than sixty%, given the whole of taxation. The subject of tax competition within the European Union for a country such as my own is therefore very sensitive. However, I remain convinced that this virtuous tax competition should be preserved provided that there is effective transparency, that is to say that the correct rules of the market are fully respected.  Let me give you an example: in my view, for example, compensation phenomena can be used. A useful example: an Italian entrepreneur legitimately decides to have an operating company in Bulgaria, because he will have tax advantages. Well, it seems to me that this cannot be prevented. However, I think it is appropriate to assume, for example, that the tax advantages obtained in this way should be partly reinvested by that Italian entrepreneur in his country of origin. This would be a good way of leaving the advantage that Bulgaria gains through a different tax regime from the Italian one, without at the same time totally taking value away from the country of origin.  These are systems that can be hypothesized. So my suggestion is also a quid pluris of imagination in creating the conditions for the future of this fiscal sovereignty within the Union. Or, through the tax credit, to solve the problem of the risk of double taxation or double non-taxation. In short, let us face those entrepreneurs who, small or medium-sized, respect the law, make sacrifices, generate value, but cannot afford the kind of tax tourism that some have sometimes been allowed and that small entrepreneurs must ultimately compensate by continuing to pay all taxes, as they have always done.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 307, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Hugues BAYET", "mepid": "125002", "text": "   Madam President, Commissioner, the Commission, through Commissioner Moscovici, tells us that this action plan will, in particular, tackle the introduction of a new legislative proposal on the consolidated common corporate tax base in the European Union.

I think it is clear that there is a consensus that action needs to be taken, and I think this has also been made clear by the work of the special committee on taxation here in this House, Mr Lamassoure.  Some colleagues think that we are moving too fast, that we are going too far and that we are exaggerating and others are sorry that we are not braver, that we do not prescribe more things than we do. I would like to say, in the face of this double criticism, that this plan is well balanced in the Commission, that it is solid and balanced, balanced and also that it is realistic.  Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank you. Most of you have supported the Commission's approach and I would like to thank you for this broad support for that action programme. In response to some of your interventions, I would like to make the following comments. Firstly, I would like to say something about consolidation. I can assure you that in the form we will give to the common basis for corporation tax, consolidation remains an important, fixed objective that the Commission is pursuing and that we will not lose our ambitions in this area. As far as tariffs are concerned, some of my fellow Members here have also called for a uniformity or harmonisation of those tariffs. Unfortunately, I have to disappoint those people, because it will not be about tariffs. The proposal concerns only the basis of corporation tax, not the rates. Thirdly, I would like to say something about country-by-country reporting. I can assure you - this has also been a question from one of the Members of Parliament - that the entire Commission is determined to take this seriously and to extend the rules to that effect as necessary.  Finally, I would like to point out that the Commission is working constructively with the OECD. I also said it in my introduction. But of course we do not do this without regard to the special features of the systems that are specific to the European Union. You know that the tax systems are very sensitive to abrupt shocks, that they have little resistance to them. In other words, all reforms must be very well documented, thoroughly prepared and also properly implemented. The approach presented today is the right, ambitious but at the same time realistic. A solid, but also flexible approach. We also need this flexibility to adapt to future developments. I am convinced that the Commission,with the proposal I had the honour of explaining here today, on behalf of the Commission, will ensure that there is more justice, that there can be more effective tax collection and that we can and will move towards a tax system that stimulates jobs and growth much more strongly. That's what people expect of us. That is also what the citizens can expect from us. And that is also what we are being asked to do by the business community, but also by small businesses.  It is now up to the Member States to launch themselves, to take control of that dossier.  Ladies and gentlemen, I am also counting on your support to support us in your capitals, but also here in this European Parliament. I think we have a common goal and if we do our best together and put our energy into it and do everything we can to get there, then I am sure that we will be able to take serious steps forward.

Part of the blame for not removing these illegal buildings in the neighborhoods is their protection from European institutions and colleagues who protect them and hinder the equal and uniform application of the laws to all Bulgarian citizens.

Unfortunately, in the negotiations with the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament has had to give in to several of these important demands. It is noteworthy that the Swedish Government in the Council of Ministers has supported taking money from research, injecting new money and loosening the budgetary rules in the Stability Pact. The EFSI does not solve the basic problem of a reduction in Europe's levels of investment. Europe has gradually become too over-regulated, sluggish and expensive to invest in. In order for Europe to become more attractive to invest in, it is necessary to implement reforms that strengthen countries' competitiveness and reduce financial deficits. Now it is crucial not to lose focus from what is really needed to increase the willingness to invest in Europe. Countries with great need for reform cannot hope for money from Brussels to take it out of the crisis, and therefore refrain from carrying out the necessary reforms.

We Moderates have taken the proposal in the right direction and succeeded in getting the European Parliament with us on crucial points: reducing the erosion of European research appropriations, the full inclusion of Member States' contributions in the budgetary rules of the Stability Pact and the fact that the ETUC should not be an excuse not to implement the necessary structural reforms. Unfortunately, in the negotiations with the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament has had to give in to several of these important demands. It is noteworthy that the Swedish Government in the Council of Ministers has supported taking money from research, injecting new money and loosening the budgetary rules in the Stability Pact. The EFSI does not solve the basic problem of a reduction in Europe's levels of investment. Europe has gradually become too over-regulated, sluggish and expensive to invest in. In order for Europe to become more attractive to invest in, it is necessary to implement reforms that strengthen countries' competitiveness and reduce financial deficits.

Unfortunately, in the negotiations with the Council of Ministers, the European Parliament has had to give in to several of these important demands. It is noteworthy that the Swedish Government in the Council of Ministers has supported taking money from research, injecting new money and loosening the budgetary rules in the Stability Pact. The EFSI does not solve the basic problem of a reduction in Europe's levels of investment. Europe has gradually become too over-regulated, sluggish and expensive to invest in. In order for Europe to become more attractive to invest in, it is necessary to implement reforms that strengthen countries' competitiveness and reduce financial deficits. Now it is crucial not to lose focus from what is really needed to increase the willingness to invest in Europe.

Additional funding for investment in transport and strategic infrastructures (digital technologies and energy), research and innovation centres, as well as investment spurring employment (especially for young people) will not only improve macro-economic indicators, but will also change in favour of the situation of individual regions in the Union. This also applies to the Kujawsko-Pomeranian Voivodeship in Poland, which is out of step with the average standard of living in the EU. Over the next three years, the EFSI is projected to mobilise investments of at least EUR 315 billion, the main beneficiary of which will be small and medium-sized enterprises. They play a key role in the economy, particularly in terms of job creation. Given the scale of the resources that are intended to be spent under the Fund, I believe that particular account should be taken of the prevention of fraud and irregularities that may occur in the process of their distribution.

We cannot allow the creation of the EFSI to have a negative impact on other programmes that already support investment in Member States, including, in particular, the CEF and Horizon 2020 instruments.

These decisions have helped workers who have found themselves in an unenviable position as a result of major structural changes in global trade flows and global financial and economic crises, in order to more easily wither the crisis and reintegrate into the labour market as painlessly as possible. Today's decision is somewhat different, but almost as important for workers who find themselves in an unenviable position due to global developments. The Commission's initiative focuses on the process of including the EGF in the electronic data exchange system (SFC2014) which has been going on for several years and is financially demanding and will result in an acceleration of the application processing process and adequate assistance to workers.

This report recommends strengthening the governance of the monetary union to move towards harmonisation of economic and fiscal policies among euro area member states.  Indeed, macroeconomic divergences in EMU threaten the stability of the currency area and confirm that the euro area is a non-optimal monetary area, as Paul Krugman, the Nobel laureate in us economics, explained. That is why the harmonisation of the structural policies of the States, desired by the Commission, means nothing more than a levelling down of wages and the social protection system of the French. This anti-democratic project once again violates France's sovereignty.  Only a concerted and anticipated exit from the euro single currency would allow states to regain their monetary sovereignty.

In particular, the report seeks to establish whether the provisions concerning decision-making processes have been sufficiently incisive and whether progress has been made in terms of closer coordination of economic policies and lasting convergence of Member States' economic performance under the TFEI. Although the regulatory framework has proved to be good, there is still a lack of an adequate assessment of the overall economic situation. Nowadays, economic governance, due to a lack of confidence, has reached a level of complexity that is detrimental to democracy and transparency. That is why the Member States must be allowed to undertake reforms on the ground of a common understanding of the situation. Finally, in order to give European citizens the maximum benefit from the single currency, the debate on EMU should be deepened.

Moreover, although there is a reference to margins of flexibility, it is specified that these can only be temporary and in any case never lead to an overrun of 3% of GDP. As a group, we have therefore tabled an alternative motion for a resolution reflecting the idea that the effects of the austerity measures imposed on member states are at the base of this historic eurozone crisis.

Since the beginning of the crisis, the euro has shown that it can withstand severe turbulence through the creation of new arrangements: from the Banking Union, the link between sovereign debt and banks, to which the EP has made a major contribution, to the European Stability Mechanism, designed to help the countries under the programme, to the very important action of the ECB with its unconventional policies, including quantitative easing, and finally to greater flexibility in the interpretation of the PS&amp;C, to increase investment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 828, "date": "2015-06-24.json", "name": "Neena GILL", "mepid": "4533", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I voted in favour of this report as I believe it contributes in a significant way to the debate on the review of the economic governance framework, as it acknowledges the need to address the lack of investment and the long-lasting low inflation situation within the euro area, and to improve the current economic framework.
