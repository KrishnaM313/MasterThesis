First, the European Council will discuss migration. We should continue working on all aspects of our comprehensive approach. To start with, we must do better in taking the fight to people-smuggling networks, from monitoring and disrupting their communications online to supporting cooperation between our police forces. Protecting our external borders and facilitating returns are of course key. In addition to everything that has already been done in this respect, the discussions in Salzburg showed the sheer determination that the recent Commission proposals should be examined as a matter of priority. Finally, we need to work more closely with countries of origin and transit by building new partnerships. This means, in particular, reaching out to African countries to expand and deepen our cooperation. In this context, Chancellor Kurz and the President of the European Council, President Tusk, recently met President Al-Sisi in Cairo and in New York to intensify cooperation. During the informal discussions in Salzburg, backing from the European Council was found for this and similar dialogues. In the coming weeks, Chancellor Kurz, President Tusk, the Commission and a group of Member States will continue reaching out to other African partners. As agreed in Salzburg, there will be an EU—Arab League summit in February 2019 in this respect. The European Council in October will look into all these issues, and the Chancellor will report on the reform of the Common European Asylum System and on the prospect of progress on its various elements. Second, the European Council will agree on immediate priorities to strengthen our internal security. In the past few years, we have achieved much collectively, including through important legislation agreed with this Parliament, from the passenger name record to the fight against terrorism financing, as well as better police, judicial and intelligence cooperation. We have certainly made headway. We need to continue this work, while focusing on effective implementation. Fostering a strong sense of security in Europe is our collective responsibility and, indeed, a priority of the Presidency. Safeguarding our security also means being prepared for new types of threats, whether they take to form of cybercrime, disinformation or any type of manipulation. How we should adapt to this evolving environment was a central issue for the leaders in Salzburg. One thing is clear: ahead of the next European elections, we need to protect our democratic processes. In the light of events, the European Council may also discuss international developments, but strengthening security is also about building up resilience to any kind of risks and being prepared when crises strike, be it as a result of hybrid attacks or natural disasters. Forest fires this summer demonstrated the importance of European cooperation in that field. The European Council will address these issues in October, but the leaders’ reflections on the longer-term aspects will also feed into the preparation of the next strategic agenda. Finally, on Brexit, the European Council will need an Article 50 format to review the state of negotiations with the United Kingdom. As President Tusk said in Salzburg, this European Council will be the moment of truth for the Brexit negotiations, where we expect maximum progress and results in the Brexit talks.

Mr President, Madam President of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief this morning as the President of the Council has summed up the results or near-results of the informal summit in Salzburg to perfection. It was an informal meeting, so no conclusions were reached. Nevertheless, I should welcome the fact that in general, not in detail, but on the main principles, the proposals recently and previously subject to the co-legislator's attention and meditation have received quite broad support.  There is no agreement, on nothing except on a few points, notably on the Commission's proposals to remove terrorist messages from the internet within one hour, or on the protection of the results of the European elections and the protection of the election campaign leading us to this important date. On the other points, the European Council expressed the view that all the proposals submitted by the Commission deserve to be treated as top priorities at the forthesty Council and at the Council in December. This concerns both the reform of the Dublin system and the protection of external borders. In this regard, I was nevertheless surprised that those who have consistently called for better protection of external borders are now making hesitant progress towards the comprehensive solution that the Commission has submitted. As far as the security union is concerned, the Commission's proposals have been widely agreed between the Member States. I would like us to agree by the end of the year on the reform of the Dublin system, which can no longer wait, and to agree on the exact contours of the protection of external borders. As far as Brexit is concerned, I don't want to add remarks to the remarks already made by the President of the Council. We will have an interesting meeting as far as Brexit is concerned.  Just two points: we want a deal. Those who think that a no deal would be the best solution are not aware of the difficulties such a scenario would imply. When it comes to the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, we are sticking to the point of view we have expressed so many times.

We talk a lot about the Tory convention, we talk about how a majority in the House of Commons is possible. We first of all underline – when we talk about Brexit – what we believe in. I want to mention one concrete example about the freedom of movement, which was so heavily discussed in the Brexit referendum campaign. The idea that millions of Europeans can freely decide where they want to earn their money and where they want to live with their families is a huge achievement in view of the history of Europe. I hope that the Brits can simply understand that we still believe in this idea and that we still want to defend it. That was a big achievement of Salzburg, that we clarified our position in this regard. This is not about punishment, it’s simply about the question that we stick to the four principles of the single market, the four freedoms which we worked on during the last decades. Brexit is a tragedy, that’s clear, but it shows all those people what populism means, what populism brings – less growth, less certainty and less future. Now we experience a new level of populism when the Foreign Minister of Great Britain, Jeremy Hunt, is again comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union. I don’t want to answer, I only want to quote the former Foreign Minister of Poland, Radosław Sikorski, he said ‘Please, Mr Hunt, show us the Gulag. Please, Mr Hunt, show us the Soviet Union army troops in your country. Please show us the Stasi system in your country.’ Sikorski is right; Mr Hunt, you should apologise for what you said.  (Loud applause) Brexit means leaving the European Union and this means losing the advantages of this Union. That is the simple principle behind this. The biggest challenge for the politicians in Great Britain, like Hunt and Johnson, is probably that after March next year they have to take over responsibility. For the first time, they will have to explain to people what they did, what are the mistakes of their political engagement, and they cannot blame Brussels anymore for what is happening in Great Britain. That will be a big change for them. For us, we will not answer to these provocations in the same way. We will simply define what is important for us and for the European People’s Party (EPP) family. I want to clarify that the citizens are at the centre of the whole debate in two main questions. Firstly, about the Northern Ireland border: I fully support Jean Claude Juncker’s ‘Ireland first’, since we don’t accept a treaty that would lead to a hard border, put at risk the Good Friday Agreement, or put at risk the Peace Process. Secondly, on the millions of EU citizens in Great Britain and millions of British citizens in the European Union: we must find a way to guarantee the legal status of these citizens, even in the case of a hard Brexit. Even in the case of a hard Brexit, we need an idea for a ring-fencing agreement to guarantee the legal status of these citizens. Not money, markets or products are important; for us, citizens are important. On Brexit, a never—ending story is going on. Our principles are clear: border protection, border control, ten thousand Frontex officers. I and my Group have no understanding why there is opposition to the idea that we share the burden of border protection between the European level and the national level, to do it together. Why is there is opposition to this? We cannot understand this. A second point is that Europe must be still a continent that is ready to help people in need. We need a strong and an ambitious resettlement programme, and we should not reopen the dossiers which we have already agreed in this migration dossier. The third point: today we look to Syria, but tomorrow we will look more and more to Africa. That is why Europe cannot have a good future if our neighbour continent, Africa, is in a chaotic situation. That is why we have to care. We have to do our best to help. Finally, one short remark on the EurAsia Summit, which is also taking place in two weeks’ time. We are partners. The European People’s Party is a party of free and fair trade. The US stopped the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. The US wants to build up walls and, having this in mind, Europe must be the continent that wants to build bridges. We want to work together with our Asian friends, but with the idea of a common level playing field. For example, on investment security we need a common understanding of what this means and we have to defend our critical infrastructure and our critical industry, so not all investments in the European Union are free-market based investments, and that’s why we have to do more on this to guarantee really free and fair trade. We shouldn’t be naive, we should defend our interests and we should be united on this. Finally, because trade is also an issue, let me underline that the Americans have concluded with our Canadian friends a trade agreement. That shows us that Washington is still ready for a compromise, probably that is a good moment after the successful trip of Jean Claude Juncker to Washington. This is the moment to give a new mandate to the Commission to start real negotiations with our American friends. We would support a free trade area between Europe and the US without tariffs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Udo BULLMANN", "mepid": "4267", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, colleagues, let me share in the criticism of the irresponsible leadership in the United Kingdom. But even more, Mr President of the Council, we have to make a difference, and here the questions are going to start. One month after Salzburg – and my Group was looking forward to Salzburg and to making progress in solidarity – there is no solidarity. It is stuck, and the Council is not delivering solutions; The Council is collecting failures. MEPs represent hard-working people, hard-working people who are looking for solutions to our major problems, but there is no delivery. Look at the reform of the asylum system. We had an awkward summer where people started dying at sea again. Even the EU missions were in danger, because harbours were closed. What do you say to this? Where is the reaction? Where is the policy for better solidarity and new solutions? And let me ask you this: what gives you the right to push for the unpacking of the asylum package, which was voted in this House by an overwhelming majority? Why do you have the right to destroy this form of solidarity that has existed here? And what do you expect from it if you continue to block the fact that there is asylum reform? This is what I cannot understand, and this is what we are critical of. We have a common responsibility as Europeans to overcome the major challenges of our time. Migration is a global phenomenon, and we need to shoulder it if Europe is to be a credible project for our citizens. If Europe is humanity and dignity, as our Treaties say we are, Europe has to stand as the global player for the good. But we also have to tackle those domestic issues that are worries for our people. Let me ask... Let me ask, Madam President: when is social protection, were workers' rights, the fight against child poverty the main topic of a summit last time? Why are you not putting this on the agenda? Why do we not address these problems that are perissing people and which urgently need an answer? We have to tackle this together, but I see blockages. So far you are not the honest broker, so far this presidency is not the bridge builder, so far you have not achieved a breakthrough. My message to you today is: please tell Mr Strache and Mr Kurz that they are on the wrong track if they are trying to further divide Europe. We have the right to expect something different from this Presidency. We support Michel Barnier in his great work, because he makes it clear that Europe stands together and because he makes it clear that Europe has a concept, common rights, but also common obligations. I believe that the majority of people in the UK now know that they have been led on the wrong path and that it was a big mistake to make this decision to leave the community. It is a big mistake that the next generation in the UK will have to pay the hardest if there are no corrections. And if this government fails – and that is what it looks like – I think that the British have a right to express their opinion directly on it. That is the message we have to give to these negotiations. Let us dare to make a new attempt to live European solidarity. But to do so, you must also be prepared to initiate a radical change, a radical change in your working method. Go to the people of Europe, really dedicate yourself to the concerns that people have. You would then have our support. But, it needs change.

As Mr Bullmann said, Mr Barnier is indeed very active, but he seems to be very eloquent in describing the economic impact on Britain. He never says anything about the economic impact on Europe. Britain leaving the common market is equivalent to 19 small and medium—sized countries leaving the common market at the same time. To come up with a new trade deal with one country is one thing, but to disentangle the relationships of thousands of companies, which have grown over 40 years, is quite another. Mr Juncker, had you at the time offered Britain a special deal on freedom of movement, Brexit would not have happened.  (Murmurs of disapproval) Yes, it is absolutely true and, by the way, for those who moan here, I would like to remind you that Mr Schröder got a special deal in 2004 when Poland joined – against my opposition at that time – with a restriction on freedom of movement of Poles coming into Germany for seven years which was, by the way, a restriction the British Prime Minister did not want. In order to end the confusion in London, we must end the ignorance here in Brussels. Mr Juncker, as a German I always felt that it was right that Britain won the Battle of Britain.

He may deplore the situation, but it’s there that they have made the wrong decision and not here. Minister, I think that you have three priorities at the next European Council, after Salisbury. The first is to unblock the migration file and especially the migration file on Dublin because, let’s be honest, the Commission has a proposal and Parliament has an opinion, but when will the Council have an opinion?  It’s fantastic to find always ways and new proposals on migration, but you have to have a position. Take a position and we can start negotiations, because it is this broken Dublin system that really is the source of the rise of racism, problems with migrants, and also of nationalism and populism.  My second point to you is to put on the agenda in October the question of our values. We see it everywhere in Europe – and certainly in a number of countries: illiberalism is on the rise, and it will not be by being silent that it will go away. On the contrary, it will continue. I think that the time is here to put it on the agenda, because the Kaczyński government is continuing, they are now already abusing the SES system, the Schengen Information System, to stop democracy advocates and activists. Mr Orbán is even financing, I think with European money, a campaign against the European Parliament, Mr President. You spoke about that yesterday. My question to you, to the Presidency of the Council, is are you going to put Article 7 concerning Poland and Hungary on the agenda of the next European Council? (Applause)  I want a clear answer from you. You are obliged to do so based on the Treaties and based on the fact that the Parliament has activated Article 7. My third priority, colleagues, is naturally to keep and to reiterate unity on Brexit – unity between the Member States, unity between the institutions. This unity is absolutely needed when you see these insane notions of some Tory politicians the last days, like Boris Johnson whose latest invention, you’ve seen, is to build a bridge. He will solve the problem by building a bridge between the UK mainland and Ireland, when Mr Boris Johnson is more known for burning bridges than for building bridges! Then there is Mr Rees Mogg who is saying, yeah I have the proposal for the future of Brexit and ordinary citizens can be secure that their savings will be secure after Brexit, and in the meanwhile he’s opening himself an investment fund in Ireland to transfer his money to Ireland! Manfred Weber has already talked about Jeremy Hunt comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union, but in his case I have to tell you that is not so abnormal for him, Manfred, as he once even confused Japan with China. So that is not the first time that this is happening. But that said, the previous time he was insulting his wife, but here he does something far more different. He is insulting not us, but millions of ordinary citizens who lived under Soviet rule for such a long time.  (Applause) That is in fact a point on which he has to apologise, I think, because we cannot accept such a thing he said.  My proposal, Minister, is that you have three clear messages at this Council meeting. First, on the migration system, we will never accept discrimination based on skills and on nationality, as Javid this morning proposed. Secondly, that we will never accept – and I say it also very clearly to the British colleagues here – an extension of this whole procedure.  Mr Boris Johnson this morning has said ‘we want an extension of Article 50’. I think it’s a very bad idea. Enough mess has been created by Brexit; enough uncertainty has been created by Brexit. Let’s stop it. The third is that we will never give in and undermine the principles of our Union. We will never undermine the principles of the Union European project to rescue a political party in Britain which is not even capable to find a common line on the exit from the mess of Brexit.

First, they carefully ignored this Parliament’s call to open an Article 7 procedure on Hungary, and then they focused on what they believe is their main topic, migration, as if this were the existential topic that our union is facing. Once again, they failed to reach any substantial agreement. I have only one thing to say about this: a year ago, the vast majority of this Parliament had the strength and the audacity to go beyond Dublin and to agree on how our union, by acting together, can fulfil its humanitarian duty in a responsible and effective way. The European Council would be well advised to follow in our footsteps. However, one thing on which the EU 27 did agree, was their stance on the Brexit negotiation. I shall readily agree that some statements made after Salzburg were unnecessarily blunt, but they came nowhere close to what we heard from the British Foreign Secretary, who took over the now commonplace rhetoric of the far right, comparing the European Union with the Soviet Union. Let him be reminded that the United Kingdom decided freely to join the European Union. It also decided freely to hold a referendum on its membership in which the citizens voted freely. A majority chose to leave, and we respect that decision. However, to those – especially in the United Kingdom – who blame the EU27 for lack of flexibility, I will say this: we cannot be held responsible for resolving intractable contradictions in the British position. Indeed, it is this Government’s choice to interpret the referendum as a decision to leave both the single market and the customs union. It is also its choice to refuse any form of special status for Northern Ireland, and it was its free choice to be party to the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Ireland. These three constraints are incompatible with one another, and resolving this British contradiction can in no way justify the dilution of the single market, one of the Union’s key pillars.  To both leavers and remainers, I will say that it is in no—one’s best interest to have the United Kingdom crash out of the European Union. This would imperil peace in Ireland, it would jeopardise the prosperity of too many of our fellow citizens, and it would poison the relationship between the two sides for the foreseeable future. We should now focus on the only thing that matters, namely finding, in the next few weeks, an agreement on the terms of the withdrawal. This will then provide both sides with the time needed to build our future relationship and, in our view, no relationship between the UK and the EU surpasses EU membership.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which I believe that we are now at a stage in the Brexit negotiations where it is getting tighter and where I have the impression that we are always trying to shift the blame for a possible failure as far away as possible. I am talking here in particular about the British Government. I certainly am not one of those who have gone into the Brexit approach of wanting to punish the British for their democratic decision or to make a symbolic decision. But what we are seeing is that, against the background of infighting, and unclear conditions, particularly in the governing party, this government in The United Kingdom is not in a position to provide even a single clear formulation of the main problems that lie ahead. What we are getting is hü und hott and no and yes and is not possible, and it is an attempt to distinguish ourselves from the failure of the negotiations – before the possible failure and increasingly likely failure – and to create a new starting point for oneself. This leads to extremely embarrassing statements by British ministers, which are absolutely unacceptable. What I would like to draw attention to, including with regard to the Irish question, is that we must make the following clear to the British Government once again: if it does not want a solution, if it does not want acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement, if it does not want to make the passage contained in the declaration of December last year, its concession that it made there, its commitment which it has made there, if it does not want to implement it, it should make it clear. Then it saves us time, money, manpower, then saves us from crumbling over things that are not to be solved at all. Then we will at least have a clear announcement. My second point is that we are still a long way from talking about what should come after it, for example on free trade agreements. However, i would also like to make my announcement to us, to the Council, to Parliament, to the Commission: we should not do anything that restricts future development opportunities, including democratic decision-making, by other governments in the United Kingdom, but also within the European Union, for example, to decide to take on stronger social commitments, to develop more democracy in their respective countries. Nor should we restrict this by negotiating free trade anywhere later. I would like to make that very clear once again. For example, you would lose the support of my group for a fair solution, which we need to shape the common future. On the Council. So, I have to make it quite clear once again: the Council has so far failed to cash in on anything under the Austrian Presidency – it has not redeemed anything! I am thinking in particular of the cancellation of the meeting of social ministers on the grounds that we have not yet come to that point. I do not think that has happened at all in recent weeks and months that, in the light of the fact that a social summit took place in Gothenburg a year ago, we do not even see themselves in a position to demand, strengthen and really send out the social signals here. My colleagues have already said a lot about migration. I fully support that. The question of the Dublin reform. But who would expect the Austrian Presidency to come up with something when the relevant ministers meet with the Italian ministers, with Salvini, with others and discuss solutions there, that they want to take control or asylum decisions already at sea. Have you ever thought about what this means that in September alone, one in five of those who fled Libya is either dead or disappeared? Can you even get an idea of what is happening? Do you not have your own responsibility to move this forward, to come up with solutions that are human and that will take us forward as a Union and strengthen our shared responsibility? So I can only say that, unfortunately, you are fulfilling all the reservations that we saw at the beginning of the Austrian Presidency. I demand that you act more actively, to act humanely, to act democraticly, and not simply to support people who ultimately have something completely different in mind. And I would also ask you to do the following: when we talk about Hungary and Poland, please look at Italy too. The law, the decree that was waved through or presented last week, to put a halt to migration – it should be carefully examined to what extent EU values are being violated here. I think in particular the reversal of the presumption of innocence for migrants and asylum seekers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Nigel FARAGE", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, as the moment of truth approaches for the Brexit negotiations in a couple of weeks’ time, I have to say that Brexiteers are dismayed at the way that our Prime Minister has acted. I’ve got to hand it to you, Mr Juncker: your negotiators are very much better than ours. The previously undiscussed issue of the Irish border, never a problem at any point during the referendum, has very effectively been weaponised by Barnier. But of course, this has got nothing to do with the Good Friday Agreement. Nothing to do with the peace process whatsoever. No, Barnier is much cleverer than that. This is all to do with making sure that the United Kingdom stays with the European regulatory framework. The one thing Barnier has been scared of from the start is us leaving and us becoming competitive. Sadly, the British Prime Minister has fallen hook, line and sinker for this, and we find ourselves now going into this next summit in a very weak position.  There is of course a better approach to all of this that would satisfy democratically both the Brexit vote and, I think, the demands of German industry and exporters. Don’t forget what an important marketplace we are. Your exporters call us ‘Treasure Island’, so many motor cars and so much wine and Belgian chocolate do you sell us. We should go for a simple free-trade deal. For 20 years here, everybody from Commissioner Kinnock to Valéry Giscard d’Estaing has said to me: if you want to leave political union and have a free- trade deal, that’s fine by us, we just need a prime minister who actually understands it. I know the European Commission would not necessarily want this, because they’re trying to use the Brexit vote as a means of saying that leaving this club comes at a price, but I do believe it would be possible. But we get to the heart of what this European Union is when we see the behaviour of the unelected bureaucrats, people like Mr Tusk, whose behaviour at Salzburg was arrogant, low—grade and pretty vulgar in every respect. But that is what you get when you design a form of government that gives power without accountability. Nobody voted for these guys, and nobody can get rid of these guys, they can do what the hell they like, and increasingly the nature of this club is authoritarian, taking away voting rights from Hungary, Poland and who knows next.  There is one little victory though that I’m pleased with. For a decade here I have noticed that that centralising authoritarian tone began to sound very like the old Soviet Union, with the concept of limited sovereignty of individual nation states. I have even talked in the past about the ‘Volkerkerker’, the old Austro-Hungarian prison of nations, and to see the British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt now using that language means that we have shifted the centre of gravity, we have shifted this debate. I know many of you here still think that we’re a hostage and that you’re going to demand some extraordinary ransom from us. We are not. We are a free people. Under the right leadership we’d say to you: let’s have a free-trade deal, or we would simply walk away.

Mr President, the October European Council will focus on migration. This is a good thing, because nothing is more serious than the migration submersion that Has been the victim of Europe since 2015. And the hardest part is ahead of us because Africa will double its population by 2050, which could lead to an additional influx of economic migrants, not to mention the climate change that is likely to amplify the phenomenon.  In the face of this challenge, the European Union unfortunately takes a contradictory position, because it shows firmness in intentions, but weakness in action. In its speeches, the Union announces its desire to curb the migration flood through, in particular, the cooperation agreements with Turkey and other countries. We would like to believe it, but the catastrophic content of the 2015 agreement with Turkey shows that it is incapable of defending European interests. By comparison, Italy has defended its interests much better and, therefore, our interests by negotiating directly with the Libyan authorities. Worse still, the Union is ruining its alleged efforts in trying to impose its crazy policy of relocating migrants to European states. It is a great call for air for the millions of foreigners who dream of coming to Europe and for the irresponsible NGOs that want to bring them. Fortunately, courageous states, such as Hungary and Poland, are resisting. By their firmness, these two states show us the only way forward if we are to save the identity of the European peoples.

I say to the EU as well as my own government, that when it comes to the stability of the United Kingdom and the security of northern Ireland’s place in it, mark my words, we are not bluffing. The Irish Sea checks proposed by Mr Barnier, would put in place customs and regulatory differences within the United Kingdom, cutting our province adrift and creating a border within the United Kingdom from day one.

Saving lives is noble, but supporting clandestine migration to Europe is not. At the June European Summit, it was decided to examine whether regional disembarkation platforms could be an alternative. These centres in third countries would then accommodate the drowning people. This practice is fully in line with international law. In the same breath, it was decided that all boats operating in the Mediterranean should not interfere with the Libyan Coastguard. So not even when Libya, mindful of those platforms, is stopping boats heading towards Europe. The bailout that no longer automatically results in an asylum application in Europe will be very dissuasive. As in Australia, this will reduce the tragic drowning to zero. In this way, we can get migration back under control, which increases public support for the real needy and the people smugglers lose their source of income.

The Council has become the bottleneck for mainly all policies, but in particular migration, because the European Commission has made proposals for a common policy, the European Parliament has managed to agree, across the political groups on a policy. Even the Pope – and I am not known for praising the Pope – is supportive. NGOs are supportive. Opinion polls show that the vast majority of Europeans are very pragmatic and they expect us to act when it comes to migration.  Local authorities are taking a different attitude. There are 28 individuals, national government leaders, blocking any kind of decent and efficient asylum and migration policy. It is your responsibility in the Council to unblock that situation.  The same goes for the rule of law. I’m glad that the Council has at least twice discussed the situation in Poland, but I think you should take your responsibility and discuss the situation in other countries where there are reasons for concern, such as Romania, Hungary, Slovakia and Malta, but also finally agree to a broader mechanism that will treat all Member States equally and gives an annual assessment of the health of democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights throughout the European Union and not dither any longer.

I’d like to offer my apology on behalf of the many British people who respect the brave struggle for freedom fought by our friends in Central Europe and the Baltic states.  For many countries, the EU has supported their path away from authoritarianism and towards prosperity. Our current cooperation in peace, democracy and human rights celebrates that achievement. Coming from a country that has always prided itself on diplomatic prowess, for me the speech was part of an unfolding national tragedy. This is where the ignorance of Brexit has led us. Insulting our friends, misrepresenting our history, indulging our fantasies of a return to the colonial past. But the Brexiteers are running out of steam. In an equally lacklustre speech yesterday Dominic Raab claimed that democracy is sacrosanct. So I’m waiting for him to join me in calling for a criminal inquiry into ‘Vote Leave’, of which he was a board member, and into Russian interference in the Brexit campaign. True democracy cannot be based on deceit and an empty prospectus; it requires that British people make a choice on the deal as negotiated so that they can decide whether this is the Brexit they voted for.

With regard to the Italian Government's position on immigration, we have received an explosive situation with regard to immigration, because what has been created in Libya by bombs in the past, by governments that were not represented by us, has created major problems. This is the fundamental point on which the Council meeting must also focus: finding a solution in Libya, France, Italy, the United States and the European Union. A table to find an immediate solution, because there is a obviously implosive risk on a nation that is far from stable at the moment and the flows will have decreased now, but could also get worse. What has the Italian Government done? When we found ourselves receiving this problem, it accepted and welcomed more than the other European countries, because we took people who very often did not even qualify for asylum. The European Union has turned its back on us completely, and the revision of the Dublin Regulation also requires us to make procedures that would make Italy Europe's great refugee camp. There is no accountability on the part of Europe on this, and what have we done? We have started to defeat the immigration business, the NGOs that brought and ferryed these people and made agreements most likely also with organised crime in Italy, they have been defeated for the time being by this government, but a European solution is still not on the table and therefore for Libya and for this problem it should be put at the forefront by the Council. As far as the economy is concerned, excuse me, but if we also look at the accounts and procedures of the six pack, since yesterday you made some very heavy statements, I would like to understand why, Mr Juncker, two years ago, when France was due to be put under procedure, you, in an interview with the same question that you received yesterday, said that France will never be put under procedure and the rules do not apply to France. , because France is France, while for Italy what is it?

Leadership of the Presidency here is needed, and many of the Members of the European Council are probably happy to have migration still on the agenda because it is a way to bash the EU all the time, and in fact the Czech Prime Minister says there is no other issue vis-à-vis the EU than migration. But I am afraid migration is not the only issue, though it looks like that’s the only problem. If we look at what our public says, 70 to 80% feel that the EU should have a higher role in trade policy. 70 to 80% want a European defence policy. Roughly the same number says that there are challenges in the economic area where Europe has a role to play. My question is, when are we going to close the gap on a number of those issues? When are we going to be delivering on those issues?  So migration, yes by all means, and let’s finally settle it. However, we finally need to address these issues as well.

Another topic, which is very important, is the protection of external borders and internal security. Speaking of external borders, I'm sure the Dublin rule needs to be improved. Parliament had its own position, the Commission had its own proposal and we expect the Council to finally take a decision on the Dublin system. That would be very good.

The British Government is torn apart by its internal divisions on the matter and is reverting to the tired old game of blaming Brussels for its own internal divisions.

In those circumstances, it is not surprising that more and more British citizens, especially those who voted leave, are saying ‘wait a minute, this is not what we were promised, this is not what we were told, and it’s damn well not what I voted for’. The Labour Party at its congress last week decided that it will vote against any such damaging withdrawal agreement on a Brexit deal. If that doesn’t bring down this government and cause a general election, then we will support other options, including the possibility of a new referendum, a referendum on the actual Brexit deal. People have a right to stand up for a proper democratic process. People have a right to say ‘this is not what we were told; this is not what we were promised’.

To start with migration, it should be obvious to all of us that we can only find a sustainable solution to the challenge of migration if it is a comprehensive solution. Yes, we are working hard to strengthen our external border protection, but those who believe that we will solve this issue just by strengthening the external borders are delusional. We can only solve this issue in a European way – and I believe by now every Member State understands that this cannot be done just individually by Member States – but we can only find a comprehensive and sustainable solution if it comprises all elements linked to migration. Not just a stronger protection of our external borders, but also agreements with countries of origin for the return of people who do not have the right to asylum, as well as forms of internal solidarity in the European Union and the revision of the Dublin Agreement.  Why? Because frankly it boils down to a very simple truth: either we find a solution internally for that challenge that effectively shows the understanding that we cannot leave countries alone simply because of reasons of geography, because they are closest to where the migration flows come from. Either we understand that, or we condemn ourselves to reintroduce internal borders in the European Union. It is as simple as that.  That is why the Commission strongly believes that we need to revise the Dublin Regulation, but we need to do it in a way that expresses the new realities, which were not known when Dublin came into being, and expresses the future reality that we will only solve this issue on the basis of European-wide solidarity. Just imagine what would have happened in 2015 and 2016 if all nations in Europe had said we just close our borders and we will not let in anyone. What would have happened to Greece and Italy if everybody had taken that attitude, as some nations have? It would have been a tragedy of incredible proportions, a human tragedy. So leaders at that time took their responsibility, sometimes at incredible political cost, but on the basis of the values I hope we continue to share.  Let me end on one issue about migration. Our sister continent, Africa, is at the core of the problem and will have to be at the core of the solution. No other parts of the world will have to take a greater responsibility for the future of Africa than Europe. Only if we understand that the future of Africa is the future of Europe, will we be able to solve the issue. In that sense, I honestly believe the challenge we are facing – To bridge the Mediterranean – is of the same magnitude as the challenge our grandparents faced to bridge the Rhine after the Second World War, and the challenge we faced when we were younger, to bridge the Elbe after the fall of the Berlin Wall. That is the magnitude of the challenge, and the sooner we wake up to that challenge, the sooner we will find a comprehensive solution to an issue, migration, that will not go away simply by refusing entry, simply by building walls, simply by protecting better our external borders.  On the issue of Brexit, the British people have voted, and that means that for now, we are all under the obligation to do as little harm as possible. That is in the interest of all Europeans, whether they are in the United Kingdom or on the continent. And I believe this means trying to find solutions for the problem we face. But let me be very clear: carving out parts of the four liberties is not going to bring a solution. Let me also be very clear. if somebody says ‘I want to leave your house but I’ll take the key, and I’ll come back in whenever I like, and take whatever I like from that house’, that doesn’t work. We have to make sure that we come to terms with the fact that the United Kingdom has expressed a wish to leave the European Union and that we negotiate in good faith to make this happen in a way that respects the integrity of the European Union, including its four freedoms, and respects the wish of the British people as it stands.  I want to make add two remarks. First of all, on the Good Friday Agreement.  How is it possible that people coming from the United Kingdom maintain that there is no link between the European Union and the Good Friday Agreement? The European Union is an integral part of the success of the Good Friday Agreement. It would not have been possible without the European Union. And you cannot just brush away that responsibility, which is a collective responsibility. The Good Friday Agreement was one of the most historic achievements of the United Kingdom, Ireland and the European Union, and we are all responsible for maintaining that legacy and for preventing the island of Ireland from going back to a past that I knew as a young man, and I hope I will never see again.  This Agreement was concluded 20 years ago, one month before I was elected to the Dutch parliament for the first time. And yes, Mr Farage, I was elected six times to a national parliament. I would like to see you try that in the United Kingdom at some stage – we’ll see. But again, the issue of Ireland – I want to stress what Jean-Claude Juncker said – is central to our responsibility to do as little harm as possible in these negotiations, and just to brush us aside in London is completely irresponsible; the Commission will never take the responsibility to do the same thing, and that is why Michel Barnier is doing what he is doing.  Finally, of course, at this stage emotions run high on all sides. I have some understanding for that, and you have to sort of forget some of the things that are being said with all these emotions. But, I represent a college of Commissioners, where more than one third of its Members have personal experience with dictatorship, with oppression and with dictatorial communist rule inspired by the Soviet Union. They have all fought to liberate themselves from this. One of my colleagues, Vytenis Andriukaitis, was born in Siberia. Why? Because his parents, Lithuanians, were deported by the Soviet regime to the Gulag. Vytenis did not know sunlight, what it meant. He did not know what the length of a day was. He had never seen an orange as a child. All these things that he has told me over the years show clearly what the Soviet Union was. And any comparison to the EU is not just misleading. It is insulting to what the Union is, to what we have become.

You are for sure aware of the fact that mandatory allocation, which is at the heart of Parliament’s mandate, continues to be the main stumbling block in the negotiations in the Council and divides not only the Member States, but also the electorates which you represent. To make progress in finding a compromise, the Presidency, in particular Chancellor Kurz, has conducted bilateral talks with all Member States over the summer, in order to find a possible middle—ground. The issue was discussed at the informal meeting in Salzburg and we will have a discussion at the Justice and Home Affairs Council on 12 October. We aim to present the outcome of our efforts to Heads of State and Government at the European Council later this month. We are also working on the other files to find a solution to the whole package.

The Council is dealing with this issue, as it is on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 16 October, as you might know.

But work-life balance or transparent and reliable working conditions – to name two of them – are absolutely not an issue!

I am particularly pleased with this visit, because you are the first Head of State of a Balkan country to speak before this Parliament. I am pleased to welcome you for the fourth time in just over a year, and the regularity of our meetings confirms a well-established reality: Montenegro is part of Europe, not only geographically but also because we share the cultural heritage, history and values that have forged our European identity. And as an Italian I cannot fail to recall how the history of Montenegro and that of Italy have intertwined several times. These meetings make it possible to anchor Montenegro and, more generally, the Balkans in the European Union. It is important to give your country a clear perspective. It must be said forcefully that your accession process to the Union is irreversible. Your leadership is essential in this process because it is a political path and not a bureaucratic one. You can count on my support and that of the European Parliament. We need to step up our cooperation to address security challenges and the threat of terrorism. It is our responsibility to work together, including to manage migratory flows. The Union must also be at your side in order to oppose, together with the influence of those who want to destabilise us. The agendas of extremists and fanatics, islamic radicalists, are contrary to our values. Your stability is our stability. We are also at your disposal to help you make the necessary reforms of administration and justice. They are valuable tools for consolidating a healthy business climate and for attracting even more European investment to your country.

Thank you for giving me this opportunity to inform you of the achievements and plans for Montenegro, the country that is the frontrunner in the negotiating process with the EU, and the country that, since its independence referendum in 2006, has been approaching its strategic national goal in a determined, stable and dynamic way. That goal is full membership in contemporary Europe’s system of values.  I would also like to present our views on the future of the Western Balkans and the European Union. I would like to understand your invitation as yet another confirmation of the European Parliament’s commitment and support, not only to the EU prospects of Montenegro, but also to the EU accession of the region and the EU’s enlargement policy. So the question is: where is Montenegro today, 12 years on, as a country whose renewed independence was met by scepticism by many in the country and neighbourhood, but also in Europe and the world? I would like to draw your attention to two of our key achievements. We have strengthened our internal stability and ensured dynamic economic, institutional and democratic development. Internationally, we have been achieving – and over-achieving – our very ambitious goals. We have been a NATO member for a year and a half; we are a candidate country for EU membership, and there are only two remaining chapters to open. We are a responsible neighbour and an important contributor to regional stability and cooperation. And as a result of all of this, we are a destination for investments and an inspiration for many renowned foreign partners.  With the moral and political capital of an ex-Yugoslav republic that did not see a war on its territory in the 1990s, we are now developing a civic society of multi-ethnic and multi-religious harmony, without outstanding issues with our neighbours, which is confirmed by our border agreements with Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo, the first such agreement among ex-Yugoslav countries. Despite being one of the least developed ex-Yugoslav republics, our economy is the leading one in the Balkans today. Last year, we registered real growth in GDP of 4.7%, which is one of the highest rates in Europe. Throughout the period since the independence referendum, we have had average annual rate of real growth of the economy of over 3%, and the living standards of our population are now among the highest in the region. Twelve years ago, we were at 34% of the EU average, and last year it was 46%. All the other Balkan countries are below 40% and some, unfortunately, are even below 30%. From 2006 to the end of last year, our GDP grew nominally by 100%. Consequently, GDP per capita in current prices in 2017 was close to EUR 7 000, compared to close to EUR 3 500 in 2006. In August this year, the average rate was EUR 511, which is nominally around 80% higher than the previous year. The average wages in Montenegro are the highest in the region, but still, unfortunately, three times lower than the EU average. This is a consequence of the historical lagging behind of this part of Europe in terms of economic development. An important impetus to economic growth has been given by foreign direct investment in this period, with net inflows of over EUR six billion, or close to 18% of annual average GDP. We have also been registering very good results in tourism, which accounts for 20% of GDP. We have a population of over 600 000, and last year we had around two million tourists in hotel and private accommodation. Of course, we should recall that throughout a good part of this period, we had a devastating financial and economic crisis in Europe and the world, which has logically adversely affected our economy as well. Insufficient employment, especially of young people, is still the biggest challenge in terms of social development in Montenegro for the period to come. It is necessary to strengthen macroeconomic stability and improve our competitiveness internationally through further structural reforms. We have made a major step forward in the Euro-Atlantic Accession processes. Last year we became a fully-fledged member of NATO and, as such, we participated in the NATO Summit in Brussels and confirmed our readiness to contribute to the policies of the alliance as a responsible and credible ally. NATO membership for us is the greatest recognition of our enormous efforts in implementing comprehensive reforms and our contribution to regional and global stability through developing cooperation among partners.  Our NATO membership has produced positive effects, not only in terms of security and political stability, but also in other areas. We have more direct investments from NATO countries, and the share of tourists from NATO countries this year grew by 25%. Our NATO accession testifies to an important reform-based step forward for our entire society, economically and politically speaking, and of the results of the continuous efforts we are investing in building rule of law. As a candidate country, Montenegro has made much progress in the process of EU negotiations. In the six years of negotiations, we have opened 31 negotiating chapters and provisionally closed three. Montenegro has fulfilled all the opening benchmarks, in total 22 of them that were set for 13 areas, thus completing this demanding phase. We have also submitted 32 negotiating positions and we are preparing for Chapter VIII – Competition. We hope that the remaining two chapters will be opened in the near future. Apart from Competition, there is Chapter 27 – Environment. At the same time we are committed to fulfilling the closing benchmarks in all the areas in which these parameters have been defined.  One should not forget that the negotiating process with Montenegro started with the new approach in which Chapters 23 and 24 are opened at the beginning, and the whole process depends on the progress of these two chapters, which is the greatest challenge for the region. Already today, Montenegro behaves as a member of the European Union when it comes to the EU Common Foreign and Security Policy. We unequivocally adhere to the common EU positions, despite the frequent pressures we are subjected to because of this. Furthermore, Montenegro is continuously contributing to peace and security through the participation of the Army of Montenegro in NATO, EU and UN operations and missions.  When it comes to the issue of resolving the migrant crisis, Montenegro is in line with the principles of solidarity and humanity, expressing the wish to receive migrants from African countries within the limits of its capacities. That is an expression of our dedication to humanitarian goals forged in the time of wars in the former Yugoslavia, when refugees of all ethnic origins at times made up a fourth of our population.  Economic and social progress is directly linked to the results in the field of the rule of law. During the negotiations in this field, we have passed approximately 70 reform laws, strengthened the strategic framework and created institutions such as the Special Public Prosecutor’s Office and the Agency for the Prevention of Corruption. We have made progress in the fight against high-level corruption and organised crime. We know the importance of the rule of law for society as a whole, not only for the negotiations. We are working hard on fulfilling the provisional benchmarks, and we hope they will be recognised in the positive report and the closing benchmarks.  We are committed to enhancing justice, creating conditions for a full guarantee of the freedom of expression in the media, and cooperation with civil society; we are supported in this by the European Commission, the Council of Europe and the OSCE. We appreciate the financial, technical and any other form of assistance from the EU and its Member States. We also share our experiences with other candidate countries. We believe that the success of any Western Balkan country on the European path is the success of all, and we are convinced that the ‘regatta approach’, reconfirmed in the recent enlargement strategy, is a mechanism that represents a true incentive for the whole Western Balkans.  Integration of the countries of the region is a good strategy for the stability of the European continent. The enlargement process is important not only for the Balkans, but also for the stability and competitiveness of Europe. I underline this because it seems that the strong euro-enthusiasm, which was characteristic of Central and Eastern Europe and also of the Western Balkans, is losing momentum. There are two strong causes for this. It is the dissonant tones coming from different parts of Europe regarding the pace of the European enlargement, and also the unresolved problems and issues that have remained open in the regions since the Yugoslav crisis, such as the problems in the relations between Serbia and Kosovo, in Macedonia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina. These two causes are interdependent. The confusion and uncertainty in Europe feed the illusions of the proponents of regressive politics in our region, who still dream of reshuffling the region and seek support for these ideas from some important international actors. They are counting on the short memory of the international community. That is why sometimes one has the impression that the destructive tones are louder today than in the 1990s. That is why I believe that the European prospects of the region in the certain and foreseeable future – which were implicitly announced at the Sofia Summit and in the last speech of President Juncker – will be wind in the sails of the pro-European elites. Unfortunately, the results of the referendum in Macedonia are the best illustration of the problems I am referring to. Decades of neglecting the problem could not be overcome through the intensified Western support in the last few months. Also, the referendum was organised too soon and without enough preparation. Perhaps the domestic public should have been given more time to fully grasp the importance of such a decision.  However, one should not lose hope that, through a two-thirds majority vote in the parliament or through new elections, this outcome can be achieved. I hope that, in Brussels and in other capitals, this result will be understood as an alarm bell and a sign that it is necessary to take more decisive strategic policy steps. What remains is the hope that this will not reflect negatively on the dialogue between Serbia and Kosovo, which is already very complicated even without this. Additional efforts are necessary to ensure that the result is achieved, even more so when knowing that there is enthusiasm, both in Pristina and in Belgrade. The most important thing is that the dialogue has been established and that it lasts, regardless of occasional incidents and the political temperature that has been raised on both sides. I sincerely hope that all those involved in this process will take into account the traditionally fragile stability of the Western Balkans and strive for a solution that will be in favour of overcoming this historically burdensome gap between Belgrade and Pristina and, at the same time, not jeopardise broader regional security interests Unfortunately, there also remains the unresolved issue of the functioning of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There is a strong feeling of dissatisfaction with the results of political players – both domestic and international – in the 25 years of implementation of the Dayton Agreement.  Bosnia and Herzegovina will go to the polls soon, but regardless of the individual composition of the future three-member presidency, I do not expect either consensus to be reached or greater commitment of leading political structure and individuals to reforms that would take the country in the direction of adoption of the European system of values and integration. It will take a new, broader international action to achieve that goal, with emphasis on the constructive consensus of all keen neighbouring countries and the most relevant international community players, who have a special role in that part of the country. We understand very well the need of the EU to eliminate the causes of the crisis it is going through and to carry out the process of internal consolidation, but we do not think the answer to those problems is to stop or seriously slow down the missionary project of unifying Europe. On the contrary, I believe that full unification is the most important part of the answer to all problems that the EU is going through. Of course, we are not trying to overlook the numerous weaknesses in the EU’s architecture, but we do not want to fall into the despondency that suggests giving up on this vision. Therefore, I think it is necessary to consolidate the vision and fix the architecture. That is the road that will bring the best guarantees that Europe keeps its global competition. Everything else would lead to its weakening, and despite the differences in our views, primarily due to current differences in the level of development, it would lead to loss for all of us, the citizens of Europe. In addition, if the European Union misses another opportunity to integrate the Western Balkans, this would bring a big threat of political involvement of other countries, third countries, which do not share the same strategic goals as the European Union. This would hold our region back within the zone of conflict and would make the European continent insufficiently stable and disunited.  The process of enlargement and full unification of the EU is therefore an optimal path for Montenegro, for the region and for Europe as a whole. However, whether this will happen certainly does not decisively depend on us. We will do what we can do, with or without enlargement policy. Whether it moves quickly or slowly, we will pursue the Europeanisation of Montenegrin society with even greater commitment. Besides, we are already well-advanced on the track that resembles a one-way street. We simply cannot go in the opposite direction. Montenegro does not want to have any other option. When we speak critically of the European Union, it is because we believe that, as Europeans, we have the right to think and speak about a topic that is our common interest and responsibility, thus we also observe the deficiencies of European policy. We will certainly continue doing so in the future, because I believe that is how we contribute to the growth in support of the regional public for the European future of our states, not the stagnation or decline as is the case now.  We do not accept that we must speak of the EU uncritically, as if it were a new religion, but rather we see it as our joint home – the current one or the future one. In the worst case scenario, as the most important neighbour of all of us but without us being members. I am sometimes misunderstood myself, at home and in some European contexts, because of these statements that are tendentious or that are seen, due to lack of understanding, as euro-sceptical. This is not Euroscepticism. On the contrary, I consider the idea of a united Europe to be absolutely superior, and I see the European path for the development of the Balkans as a path without an alternative, but we expect everybody to accept that we in the Balkans are partners in the negotiation process with the European Union, and not an experimental laboratory of its administration. We in the region can complete this process of further unification with Europe much quicker and better if the vision is crystal clear and if the partnership is honest and in line with mutual respect. Everything that modern Montenegro has gone through is based on, and is fully in line with, the essential values that the European Union was founded on and continues to preserve, from preserving peace and multi-ethnic harmony in the 1990s, to the referendum on independence held in line with the highest European standards, and finally to the decisive and successful resistance to the brutal aggression in 2016, which aimed to take freedom away from Montenegro and divert it from the European and Euro-Atlantic path of development.  Therefore, we are right to emphasis Montenegro took a ground-breaking step forward after roaming the wastelands outside Europe, together with the region, throughout history. We have finally taken our ship of state into the direction of its natural European harbour, and we shall not give up on this intention of ours. The Western Balkans region is at a turning point too: it will complete its political and economic transition and join the club of European Union states, or it will continue to struggle with its interethnic and interreligious conflicts, complicated open issues, underdevelopment and low standard of living. Like a time bomb that can still jeopardise European security.  I believe I share the opinion of all of you when I say that all institutions and official authorities, as well as all individuals who are politically involved in any way at the national level or within the European framework, today have the responsibility to contemplate a better and safer future for a united Europe throughout the entire continent that is based on traditional values and embroidered with the spirit of the new times we live in.  It is very important that the forthcoming elections for the European Parliament are prepared and held in this positive atmosphere. The balance of power in Parliament will, to a great extent, define Europe’s path and determine the future of European nations. I want to believe that this path will be a joint path for us from the Western Balkans too. With this, I would like to thank you all once again. I want to assure you that you will always have a reliable partner in the small country of Montenegro, which sees the EU as a lighthouse we are getting closer to.

As a result, we recognised that the European Parliament was authorised to adopt the Union's annual budget for 2017 in Brussels. On 10 September 2018, I imposed sanctions on Georges Bach, Guillaume Balas, José Bové, Edouard Martin, Claude Rolin, Maria Arena and Isabelle Thomas for the actions taken during the plenary session on 3 July 2018, which seriously disrupted parliament's work and caused the session to be interrupted.  On 11 September 2018, Maria Arena, Georges Bach, Guillaume Balas, Edouard Martin and Isabelle Thomas appealed against that decision. At yesterday's meeting the Bureau examined these appeals and confirmed the decisions on sanctions, which consist, in the case of George Bach, Guillaume Balas, Maria Arena and Isabelle Thomas, of the loss of entitlement to the residence allowance for a period of five days and, without prejudice to the exercise of the right to vote in plenary session. , suspending all the activities of Parliament and its bodies for a period of five consecutive days in which Parliament or any of its bodies, committees and delegations meet and, in the case of Edouard Martin, in the loss of entitlement to the residence allowance for a period of eight days and, without prejudice to the exercise of the right to vote in plenary session , suspending participation in all the activities of Parliament and its bodies for a period of eight consecutive days in which its bodies meet. These sanctions, having been suspended at the time when the appeals were lodged, are again beginning to apply from today.  Pursuant to Rule 166 of the Rules of Procedure, on the basis of the conclusions of the Advisory Committee responsible for complaints of harassment concerning accredited parliamentary assistants and Members and having taken note of the written comments of the Member concerned, I have decided to impose a sanction on Giulia Moi for her conduct towards parliamentary assistants, which is described as psychological harassment. The penalty is the loss of entitlement to the residence allowance for a period of 12 days. The decision was notified to the Member concerned, who may lodge an internal appeal against that decision before the Bureau in accordance with Rule 167 of the Rules of Procedure. That action is suspensive in that action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 87, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Bruno GOLLNISCH", "mepid": "1164", "text": "   Mr President, my point of order is based on Articles 166 and 167 of the Regulation.

The issue concerns the EU's involvement in the drafting of a UN instrument aimed at influencing the responsibility of multinationals for human rights.  The UN is currently carrying out an intergovernmental process to develop a global system within the framework of the International Human Rights Act to address business-related human rights violations. This is an important step forward. The EU must play an active role in the process.  The joint issue of the three committees is proof of Parliament's interest in the subject. It will help us to better understand the EU's current reservations about the ongoing UN negotiations. We are working with other European institutions to better understand their perspectives and concerns. We would also like to ask when and under what conditions we can expect a formal EU mandate to participate in the negotiations. What role does the EU intend to play next week when the next round of intergovernmental negotiations takes place in Geneva? I would like to remind you that the Committee on Development has also adopted a resolution on this subject, calling on the EU to take part in un-led negotiations. The aim is to reach an agreement that would hold multinationals that commit human rights violations to account. The resolution will be put to the vote here on Thursday.

Mr President, Commissioner, representatives of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. It is quite clear that we have more and more global value chains in international trade. 70% of international trade relates to global value chains. Of course, it is not possible to ensure that these global value chains run fairly with contracts with individual countries. We are increasingly in a situation where we have seen a violation of human rights and workers' rights in different countries around the world. That is why it is all the more important that we look at these global value chains and really make clear the responsibility of companies for these global value chains, be it smartphones or T-shirts. We have to get on with it. Global corporate responsibility must be the goal. By the way, ladies and gentlemen, we have, after all, introduced legislation in the field of conflict minerals that provides for binding care from the mine to the melting furnace to the product. And so, in many areas, it is necessary to enforce binding due diligence. That is why we also welcome the initiative of Ecuador and South Africa to enforce a binding code of due diligence within the framework of the United Nations. That is why we are also concerned, when there are votes from the Commission and the Council, that they want to withdraw from this discussion. No, the European Union must proactively influence this discussion and move it forward, so that we can ultimately take up this approach of the United Nations, which is already 40 years old, and enforce a clear duty of care for companies. Of course, there are also a few weaknesses in the approaches of Ecuador and South Africa, e.B. why only multilateral and multinational companies are taken into account.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, respect for human rights in the business world is a decisive issue for us, particularly as many companies operate in developing countries. Yet there is still a lack of a comprehensive approach to regulating respect for human rights in transnational societies. The United Nations in 2014, in a resolution of the Human Rights Council, specifically set up an intergovernmental working group, in order to create a legally binding instrument on transnational companies and, above all, to fill a gap between respect for human rights and commercial interests. Although the protection of human rights is one of the Main Objectives of the European Union in its external actions, in line with the Treaty on European Union, the European Union itself has been very reluctant with regard to the binding Treaty. It should be remembered that several Member States voted against the resolution on the creation of the working group in 2014. The European Union and the Member States must commit themselves to playing a key role in this process, maintaining a single clear position and a common negotiating mandate that are currently lacking. I would like to stress that, after many internal debates, we managed to put the resolution to the vote on Thursday with the European Parliament's position on this issue. Four years after the creation of the working group, I would like the Council, the EEAS and the Commission to somehow justify the absence of a negotiating mandate, allowing the European Union to participate effectively in the process.

I shall endeavour to give you briefly the broad EU view from the Council’s perspective, and afterwards the Commission will be in a position to elaborate on the topics concerned. I would first of all like to stress that advancing on business and human rights is an important priority of the EU’s human rights agenda, as set out in the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy for the period 2015—2019, adopted by the Council on 20 July 2015. It should be noted that the recurrent element which is underpinning all our actions identified in the action plan is the United Nations Guiding Principles of 2011 as the first, and so far only authoritative global framework to address the impact of business on human rights. In its 2016 conclusions on business and human rights, the Council recalled the global consensus reached on the UN Guiding Principles adopted in 2011 and stressed that any possible further steps regarding the international legal framework for business and human rights at UN level must be inclusive, firmly rooted in the UN Guiding Principles, and address all types of companies, not only transnational. These three principles have always constituted our barometers for engagement in the intergovernmental working group process. President, honourable Members, I can reassure you that the Council, in particular through its Working Party on Human Rights, continues working on the business and human rights file, including on developing our common position on the process regarding a possible legally binding instrument. The EU is, at the same time, progressing on other tracks, notably the Working Group on Business and Human Rights and the Annual Forum on Business and Human Rights, specifically on efforts to achieve a coherent approach throughout the EU on access to remedy for victims of business-related human rights violations. The EU continues to offer its support to the accountability and remedy project led by the Office of the High Commissioner on Human Rights, recognising that the initiative may provide best practices that can be implemented at EU and Member State level, including on improved cooperation between states in cross-border cases.

The European Union is fully engaged in the ongoing discussions on Business and Human Rights. We are not only exploring possible future initiatives, we are also intensively working both internally and with partners to implement the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Already, 14 EU Member States have adopted a national action plan on business and human rights. Our policy is based on a mix of voluntary and regulatory measures that provide for tangible protection against human rights abuses. The EU is therefore not opposed, as a matter of principle, to discussing a potential legally binding instrument, and this is why we have engaged in the process led by Ecuador.  Nonetheless, we insist that the scope of the discussion should include all companies, not only transnationals or multinationals, as many human rights violations are committed by domestic companies. The draft text submitted by Ecuador last July contains important elements, including on access to remedy by victims of corporate abuse. Yet its scope is still too restrictive. Another prerequisite for the European Union is that the negotiations are based on the existing UN Guiding Principles. What is also clear at this moment is that the process is not yet fully ripe for negotiations. For the moment, the Human Rights Council is still divided on this issue. We nevertheless engaged in discussions in Geneva in the hope that process issues would be solved and a meaningful discussion possible.  What is, in our view, essential is a process that would be chaired in an impartial manner and that would be inclusive, transparent and predictable. We also ask that rules and established practice in Intergovernmental Working Groups are respected. We hope that we can count on the European Parliament to also signal the need for a better process. As the European Union, we have engaged in in—depth discussions with Member States, industry and NGOs on these very complex issues. We have done extensive work on the principles for EU engagement and on the possible format and points of substance of a possible legally binding instrument, and we stand ready to debrief the European Parliament at any stage of this process. We believe the added value of any possible legally binding instrument should be to ensure a level playing field for companies globally. Therefore, it is essential for a proposal to reach sufficient traction amongst UN member states. It is also important to ensure policy coherence and avoid the duplication of efforts. We are reflecting on which format of a legally binding instrument would stand better chances to achieve this level playing field.  These discussions are also a good opportunity to encourage others to upgrade their standards. The European Union can offer its experience on corporate due diligence in the field of human rights, including transparency requirements and public procurement rules. We need better prevention of abuses, and better access to remedy for victims when abuses occur.  The European Union has measures in place to ensure judicial and non-judicial access to remedy for victims, including access to justice and acknowledgement of victims’ rights, with a focus on provisions to clarify issues of jurisdiction, and to make international judicial cooperation and mutual legal assistance more effective. In addition, on access to remedy, the Commission is conducting a study aimed at collecting information on existing judicial and non-judicial mechanisms in the EU Member States concerning access to remedy for victims of business-related abuses. The results are expected by the end of next year, 2019.  To conclude, the European Union is committed to continuing a discussion with a view to finding feasible and sustainable solutions to the existing protection gaps, on a basis that ensures a true level playing field for all.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 109, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "José Ignacio SALAFRANCA SÁNCHEZ-NEYRA", "mepid": "2002", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Commissioner, Madam President-in-Office, ladies and gentlemen, as the first article of the resolution which will be adopted by Parliament tomorrow says, the company plays an essential role in the process of economic globalisation through international trade in goods and services.

The fact that France now has a corporate duty of vigilance law, the Netherlands has the Child Labour Due Diligence Law, and even the UK with its Modern Slavery Act, all show that countries are slowly coming round to the right way of thinking on this issue. As Bernd Lange rightly mentioned, at the EU level we are now in a position where we have the Conflict Minerals Regulation, which contains binding due diligence. This Parliament says that, even if nothing happens at the UN, we should be extending that to the garment sector to make sure we have due diligence in the whole garment chain.  I am pleased to say that we are also slowly making progress on our trade deals. The—EU Japan FTA includes, for the first time, a chapter on corporate governance. In relation to investment, while I have supported investment protection for industry, I equally think it’s time for us to ensure that investors meet their legitimate obligation to protect the folk that they meant to serve as institutions.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Commissioner! I have looked at who has advocated the resolution of the Human Rights Council. These are countries such as China, Cuba, Russia, Vietnam. Who was against it? Austria, Czech Republic, Estonia, France, Germany. So those who voted in favour do not have so much to do with human rights in their own countries, while the countries that voted against respect human rights. We must now also see what the practice of cross-border companies is. What are they doing? They offer higher wages, they have better working conditions, they have better health care and they have more social benefits than local businesses. Why is that? Not because they are so nice, the big companies, but because they deserve their workers to do well. Healthy and satisfied workers are more productive than dissatisfied workers. Next, you have to see there are spill-over effects. Cross-border companies have exemplary functions in many countries. This must not be allowed to fall under the table, as they affect others and then follow suit like others. And if I look at what is happening in the individual countries, when a large company in Germany is doing something that violates human rights – for example, supporting child labour – then, to a certain extent, this company is now often led to the slaughterhouse. That is not what you want in Germany! It would be good for the world if local companies were guided by the practices of cross-border companies. That is the reality!

I would like to greet the rapporteurs and my colleague, Lola Sanchez Caldentey, who insisted that today's debate should conclude with a vote on a resolution. The best way to help the United Nations move this debate forward is to support the obviously binding nature of these regulations. This is essential for the credibility of the European Union as a global player. In essence, ladies and gentlemen, the issue is primarily political. We need to be consistent with the models developed in the past. I recall that there has been a great deal of progress on the issue of conflict minerals, the regulations on wood and derivatives, the regulation on registration, assessment, authorisation of chemicals and restrictions on these substances. So, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union is a normative power at the same time as it is an economic power. As such, it must position itself as a leader in the dissemination of best practices and in the development of global standards. The Commission and the Council do not have the right, Commissioner, Madam President, to avoid this debate, and that is why I would like you to clarify your position on the mandate.

It is therefore very good that the United Nations started a process in 2014 to obtain such a binding treaty. The fact that this draft text is now in place is nice, but a little more ambition is still allowed. Does this treaty really cover all human rights or not? And will crimes by state-owned enterprises and local businesses also be taken into account? And how are we actually going to enforce the treaty? What will the European Union do in Geneva?

As we know, the private sector is an important partner in achieving the SDGs and in mobilising additional resources for development cooperation, which is why private sector actors must adapt to the principles of development effectiveness and respect the principles of corporate responsibility.  Globalisation today affects all areas of life, including economic activity and the supply chain. Therefore, the role of corporations in ensuring respect for human rights is becoming more important and creates a situation where international standards and principles are crucial to avoid human rights violations in third countries. Unfortunately, there is still a lack of a holistic approach to corporate responsibility for violations of these rights, and victims face numerous obstacles to access to remedies, including judicial measures. Despite the European Parliament's support for the IGWG process and its request for engagement from the European Union, it has expressed concerns about the progress of the process so far and still appears to be threatened by obstacles preventing it from engaging in the negotiation process, resulting in a lack of negotiating mandate.  In the view of our political group, the Union and its Member States should join a new, potentially legally binding instrument if their demands are properly incorporated and its mandate should not go beyond what is legally established in the European Union.  As we know, there are countries that are not involved in this process. The effectiveness of the Treaty is conditional on the fact that the vast majority of states must ratify and respect it.

This aspiration relates to the insufficiency of the rules adopted voluntarily by undertakings, on the one hand, and the difficulty of clearly determining the judicial scope of states in the case of undertakings operating in third countries, on the other. Globalisation has made this system more complex by weakening traditional borders and by promoting the geographical mobility of businesses. The potential negative effects of multinational activities are particularly worrying among the most vulnerable and unprotected communities, such as indigenous communities and peasants.  In 2014, the establishment of a UN intergovernmental working group to draft a binding treaty proposal led by Ecuador and South Africa gave new encouragement to this old aspiration. The activities of this group were, however, accompanied with great skepticism. The truth is that there was no commitment and enthusiasm from the countries of the European Union on the part of several actors. Nevertheless, this initiative is beginning to bear fruit with a first treaty proposal prepared by Ecuador.  The great challenge is that the Treaty covers the multiple situations of the potential negative impact of human rights that arise from business activity indirectly, through its branches, subsidiary companies and companies or contractors. It is in this dimension that the European Union must concentrate its efforts and contributions. We are convinced that this Treaty can take us to a new level with regard to the regulation of globalisation, and it could pave the way for responsible and sustainable globalisation, right away with guarantees of access to justice and reparation.

I would like to reply and make some remarks on some of the observations.  First of all, let me underline what I said in my opening remarks. The European Union is not opposed, as a matter of principle, to discussing a potential legally—binding instrument, and this is why we have engaged in the process led by Ecuador. The second point, also on your observations. We nonetheless insist that the scope of the discussions should include all companies, not only transnational or multinational, as many human rights violations are committed by domestic companies. Some of you raised this issue.  My third point is about the European Union’s position on this specific legally—binding instrument. The European Union is a staunch supporter of the United Nations in a rules-based global order and we expect all EU Member States to comply with these obligations and implement them strictly. Full implementation of these existing human rights obligations would help to respond to the numerous cases documented by civil society organisations and human rights defenders. We believe that any possible further steps regarding the international legal framework for business and human rights at UN level must be inclusive, firmly rooted in the UN guiding principles, and address all types of companies whether international or domestic, as I have already said.  In the world of today, it is only within a multilateral framework that we can ensure that all the victims of human rights abuses resulting from companies’ actions receive the same level of protection. The European Union has a strong track record in agreeing with and implementing the UN Guiding Principles. We need to acknowledge progress also by a number of European companies to implement these Principles, and expect others to follow. However, we should continue to explore options for filling the gaps in their implementation, for increasing respect of human rights by private operators and ensuring access to remedies both multilaterally and bilaterally. We should also see how we can best promote a global level playing field in line with international standards in this area.

At the meeting, which I also attended, the European Union reaffirmed once more its political and financial support. UNRWA is essential to peace in the Holy Land. It is serving millions of Palestine refugees and preserving the very possibility of a Palestinian state. The ministerial meeting was an opportunity to underline the importance of guaranteeing full financial support to UNRWA, and we managed to mobilise very significant resources that reduce the funding gap enormously. This means that Palestine will continue to be assisted by the UN Agency. The Commission proposed additional support to UNRWA of EUR 40 million. The EU and its Member States collectively provide almost half of UNRWA’s budget. We have all invested over EUR 1 billion in funding over the last three years. We are, and we will continue to be, strong, reliable, and critical supporters of the Agency. Supporting UNRWA is, above all, a humanitarian responsibility, but it is also in our collective interest for the sake of peace in the Middle East. First, millions of people, many of them extremely young, rely on UNRWA for essential services such as education, health services and food assistance. This is true in the West Bank and Gaza, but also in countries such as Jordan, Lebanon and Syria that host a large number of Palestinian refugees. Thanks to these funds, half a million children can go to school every day, millions of patients receive health care, and thousands of people have access to jobs. Second, UNRWA’s activities are particularly important for the people in Gaza who face a complex political and humanitarian situation. At last week’s ad hoc Liaison Committee meeting on Palestine in New York, we recalled that our priority must be to avoid another escalation and to restore a political horizon for the people of Gaza, but this will never be possible if we don’t also address the humanitarian situation right now and remain committed to assisting the most vulnerable people in Gaza. Finally, without UNRWA it would be even more difficult to reach a negotiated two-state solution. A just, fair, agreed and realistic solution for Palestine refugees is a final status issue that only the two parties can resolve through negotiations, with the support of the international community. Today, the Agency is reforming itself to be more effective, efficient and to have a perspective for the future. UNRWA has expanded its donor base and taken internal management measures to increase efficiency and reduce costs. Next year will be an even tougher year for UNRWA. In this context, we need to stress once more the crucial importance for UNRWA to intensify its efforts to put in place cost saving measures and reforms, including refocusing UNRWA’s activities on core services for the most vulnerable refugees. We are engaging with UNRWA to explore synergies with other potential service providers to safeguard key services to Palestinian refugees.  Precisely because we believe that UNRWA is essential, we want it to be more effective and efficient than it is today. We will do our utmost to ensure that UNRWA and its staff continue to operate until a just, fair, agreed and realistic solution to the plight of Palestinian refugees is finally reached. Without UNRWA and without the two—state perspective, there would just be chaos and violence for both the Israeli and the Palestinian people. We need a multilateral framework to support negotiations, we need a collective engagement to push for political progress and we need the region and the entire international community to continue to play their role. The European Union will double down on efforts to work with our partners – the US and other regional and international partners – towards our common goal of a negotiated two—state solution.

It is precisely the American decision to stop funding UNRWA in its current form that offers the international community an excellent opportunity to drastically change the essential aid to Palestinian refugees in a responsible manner.

Mr President, this debate is not so much about Israel and about Palestine. Maybe not so much about the United States. But it is about the decisions of one man, President Trump, his unilateral decisions and their negative consequences. First, and we all know that, there was the decision to move the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem. Then there was the decision to discontinue some of the financial assistance to UNRWA and finally to implement the overall cessation. Colleagues, if you as a state fund one-third of an organization and you decide to stop it unilaterally, then you don't, colleagues and Mr. De Belder, to encourage reform. That's bullshit. Then you do it because you want to shut down the organization. And when he took office – we all remember that – President Trump said, \"I want to work on the ultimate deal.\" His actions, on the other hand, seem rather partisan. He recently expressed his support for a two-state solution, but how? The conclusions I draw from his actions is that by penalise one party he wants to get them back to the negotiating table. \"Leverage,\" as you might hear him say. Now, if President Trump thinks that way he will go down in history as the person who is implementing a two-state solution, then he is completely wrong. Because UNRWA, ladies and gentlemen, and the Commissioner has said it, is fundamental to the future Palestinian state. It is in favour of the education of the children, for the food packages, for the health care of the Palestinian refugees. That is why, Commissioner, I am pleased that Europe is taking responsibility. That we closed a piece of the hole. But there are three things we need to keep doing. One, continue to show commitment to the Palestinian refugees. Two, unrwa guide in the necessary reforms.

And what is the European Commission doing? He is fine with it all and continues to distribute many hundreds of millions of euros a year. Unsellable and unacceptable. Unfortunately, my own country, the Netherlands, faithfully transfers many tens of millions of euros annually. Money that we can spend much better in our own country. Mr President, it is clear.

From this debate I conclude that we all share a common interest in using the EU’s diplomatic power and EU instruments to their full potential in support of ensuring the sustainability of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) core services to vulnerable Palestinian refugees.  We will continue to look at how best to use all the instruments available to us in humanitarian relief, stabilisation and development assistance, and political dialogue but please allow me to make some clarifications due to one or other comments or statements by honourable Members.  First, UNRWA is not something which founded itself, nor is it an NGO. It was founded based on a UN General Assembly Decision from 8 December 1949 as a reaction to the Palestinian refugee disaster in the late 1940s. Its mandate is renewed every three years. So the whole construction is based on a UN General Assembly Decision, meaning a multilateral agreement.  There is, by the way, a clear mandate, a clear task and in that respect UNRWA is different from the tasks of UNHCR. UNRWA deals with providing necessary support, in particular of education and health treatment, and other things but in particular these two areas, for refugees, definitely in a medium-and long-term perspective as this has been continuing now for many decades, whereas UNHCR is dedicated to supporting, to helping the short-term challenge of certain refugee situations all around the world.  This was, by the way, clearly presented by the current UN Secretary-General, Mr Guterres, last week in New York, at this event I already mentioned in my introduction, and Mr Guterres is very well placed to speak about this because before he became Secretary General of the UN, he was for 10 years High Commissioner for Refugees and chairing UNHCR.  Having said all this, I think we should say what is happening. The US is breaching international agreements – international agreements – and, by the way, bilateral contracts between UNRWA and the US about the funding of UNRWA. Only in December last year, the administration signed a contract with UNRWA about further financing and only a few weeks later they decided to cut or to stop immediately payments to UNRWA. This is a decision which again does not respect multilateral agreements and contracts.  Finally, as was also said by some colleagues, some Members of this Parliament, on the textbook issue, here once again a clarification. Our support to UNRWA is the payment of salaries and pensions for teachers in the West Bank. We are already working to tackle the deficiencies in the Palestinian Authority (PA) education system with an EU-PA dialogue linked to EU financial cooperation. The EU insists that Palestinian textbooks meet UNESCO standards for peace and tolerance in school education. This was in the EU-UNRWA strategic dialogue.  The EU consistently requests clarification on UNRWA handling of non-neutrality buyers and non-violence issues in textbooks. In the recent review of support to the two-state solution, I proposed linking disbursement of funding to the implementation of agreed reforms, which could also be extended to curricula.  May I close by signalling once again my appreciation of Parliament’s role in keeping this important file on the international agenda.

It aims to impose by force a single state, of a confessional and racist nature, in virtually the entire historical territory of Palestine.

It has taken a tremendous toll on this country, where millions are suffering the consequences of the conflict. We see images of Yemenis eating tree leaves and parents forced to watch their babies starve to death. This is completely unacceptable. The figures are appalling: almost 18 million are literally starving. The UN recently warned that they may be unable to prevent a massive famine – unless the security situation improves. The escalation of hostilities along the coast has worsened an already disastrous situation: civilians and civilian infrastructure continue to be targeted, in clear violation of international humanitarian law. More than half a million people have been displaced from Hodeidah, where several hundred thousand more remain trapped. Public salaries in the northern part of the country, controlled by the Houthi, have not been paid in years. Instead of going to school, children are being recruited to fight on the frontlines. With the collapse of basic services, Yemenis have been deprived of health facilities and drinking water. This has led to the worst cholera epidemic ever recorded in the country. The war has also disrupted imports of basic commodities, driving prices up and pushing more and more Yemenis into poverty and destitution. Smuggling and war profiteering are thriving on the back of a suffering population. Lawlessness has allowed terrorist groups like al-Qaeda or Daesh to gain a foothold in the country.  The war has also had an impact in the region. Saudi Arabia has become a regular target of missiles coming from Houthi-controlled areas. Maritime traffic between the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean has been affected, as several ships have been targeted by rockets. But perhaps more importantly, the war has increased regional tensions. Indeed, Yemen remains a catalyst for instability and regional turmoil. There is no easy fix for Yemen. A political settlement will require concessions from all sides, continued banking and diplomatic pressure from the international community. That is why we believe it is more crucial than ever at this time to lend as much support as possible to the United Nations and their Special Envoy, Martin Griffiths. Let me thank him for his attempt to resume consultations in Geneva among the parties. It is unfortunate that the Houthi did not attend. As Griffiths put it, resumptions of talks are always a delicate, fragile moment. Our support, from the EU and our Member States, is now truly essential. We will therefore continue to call on the parties to remain engaged in the UN-led process in view of achieving a comprehensive political settlement to this really unacceptable war.  We will not just ‘declare’ our political commitment. We are looking into ways to provide concrete support to the UN Special Envoy team in areas identified by Mr Griffiths. The idea is to add value to his ongoing work and complement his efforts where needed. Furthermore, the European Union is already contributing EUR 173 million of development assistance to several projects in Yemen, ranging from rural resilience, health and nutrition, food security and support to displaced persons. These projects are meant to lay the groundwork for a stable Yemen by supporting crisis-affected communities and helping maintain the basic functions of local authorities. Likewise, the EU has allocated EUR 233 million in humanitarian aid alone through our partner organisations since the beginning of this conflict in 2015. Our humanitarian aid has been directed to the areas most in need and we have continued our advocacy efforts in international fora, even last week during the UN General Assembly. In this regard, we believe that the mandate of the Group of Eminent Experts set up by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights should be renewed. Its last report points to violations of international humanitarian law committed by all sides. Accountability is crucial, not only to a real resolution of the conflict, but also to an effective and inclusive reconciliation process in Yemen. The people of Yemen have suffered for too long. Building a more cooperative regional dynamic is in everyone’s interest – and it is becoming more and more urgent.

The brutal and bloody long-term conflict in Yemen is about to get even worse, as the violent and indiscriminate attacks and blockade on civilians continue. As a consequence, today 75% of civilians are already completely dependent on humanitarian aid, and more than 17 million people are facing food insecurity.

The humanitarian aid is proving to be insufficient, and the Houthi rebels have themselves blocked the delivery of humanitarian aid.

It is a crying shame.  We should focus, of course, on reining in Iran as it helps the Houthi rebels. But just as we do not allow the sale of weapons to these militants, an embargo should finally be adopted vis-à-vis Saudi Arabia. When the Dutch Government, along with the Canadian Government, sought an independent investigation into what was happening in Yemen, Saudi Arabia pushed back.

Today I want to give you two emblematic examples: last Friday, the UN Human Rights Council voted in favour of extending the mandate of a group of eminent experts to investigate human rights violations in Yemen. This group of experts had adopted a report accusing the parties in the conflict, as early as 28 August between them, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, of possible war crimes. It is not surprising that Riyadh and Abu Dhabi voted against it, it is much more so that both Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates sit on the Council, the world's most important body for respect for human rights.  Even more absurd is the situation in our own house, as you all know, the European Union has adopted a binding common position on arms exports. Sales to Riyadh would at least violate two of the eight criteria of the position, but if you violate there are no sanctions and that doesn't seem to matter to anyone. Recent cases and controversies in Spain and Germany are emblematic, emblematic of the reportage released on Friday in which a story of corruption and sale of Leclerc tanks by France to the Emirates is documented. Those same tanks are now actively used in the conflict for defensive purposes, thunders the Minister of Defence, long live hypocrisy! Other countries are involved, including my own, I hope for a little longer, but on the other hand, no Member State wants to give up its rich contracts, well aware that its non-exports would simply be replaced with peace of position, indeed common hypocrisy.

In April this year, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres described the situation in Yemen as follows: \"Yemen is the world's worst humanitarian crisis. More than 22 million people, or three-quarters of the population, are in need of humanitarian aid and protection.\" Indeed, the panel of experts set up by the United Nations Human Rights Council has found that international humanitarian law in Yemen is being violated by all sides. As the previous speakers have already said, I share the view that there can be no winners in this conflict, which over the years has increasingly become a proxy war for regional powers. What happens next? In my view, three brief comments. Firstly, it is regrettable that the Huthi delegation did not show up in an attempt to resume peace talks in Geneva. Special Envoy Martin Griffith's efforts to bring the parties to the conflict together for talks in October must also be supported. As I said, this conflict can only be resolved politically. Secondly, the first objective on the road to peace should be confidence-building measures between the parties to the conflict. This concerns, in particular, intra-Yemeni dialogue without the involvement of other regional powers. Thirdly, independent investigations into human rights violations are necessary, and they are also in the national interest.

Let’s be clear: this is a proxy war between Iran and the Saudi-Emirati alliance, with only the Yemeni people suffering from indiscriminate attacks. So many decisions on Yemen, yet few taken by Yemenis themselves. So little interest shown by the international community in local political groups, apart from the discredited Hadi regime, has seen the splintering of normally homogenous groups. The Southern Movement, which was a broad church, has been marginalised and split into so many groups that what could have been a stabilising force has become a group of warring factions. On Sunday, seven people were killed through intra-Houthi fighting. We must engage honestly with local political leaders, respecting their concerns. Peace can only be built up from the base of local society in Yemen and we should not prejudge political outcomes before genuine discussion.  Finally, the Yemeni rial is at an all-time low. Demonstrations are planned throughout the country as ordinary people rise up against this further disaster.

Furthermore it is estimated that a staggering 22 million – 75% of the population – are in urgent need of humanitarian aid often encompassing the most basic of needs such as access to food, water and medicine. The Saudi—led offensive, particularly since its push this summer into Hodeidah region, has worsened the humanitarian crisis. According to estimates from the charity Save the Children, cases of cholera have increased by 170% since June, which in a country that has seen its public health facilities – largely as a result of bombing of hospitals – decimated, poses the real threat of a worse and more deadly epidemic. It is clear that talks must now resume urgently, not only to find a lasting resolution to the conflict but also ensure ways of alleviating the humanitarian disaster situation. In this regard, it is of paramount importance that the Houthi faction engages in the UN—led process in Geneva.

The first article of the draft Resolution to be adopted tomorrow expresses our concern at the devastating situation in this country, which has been presented to us by the Commissioner and which has been described to us by other Members: 22 million people in a humanitarian emergency – 5 million children – and 77,000 children dying each year. This situation is really unsustainable.  That is why, Mr President, apart from expressing our concern and seeking culprits, what we should do is to seek solutions.  First of all, we have to deal with the humanitarian emergency. That is why it is important to recognize the efforts of the United Nations and its negotiating tables for the country. Secondly, Commissioner, thank you for the efforts being made by the European Union, and particularly the Commissioner, who is joining us today in this debate. And thirdly, also thank many regional partners who have made important contributions available to the United Nations to try to alleviate this situation.  On the other hand, Mr President, it is very important to stop and end violence, to ensure that international humanitarian law prevails and, at the same time, to try to protect civilians.  Finally, I believe that the Commissioner has explained this in a crystal clear way, we must support the efforts of the special envoy of the Secretary-General of the United Nations to try to make the two sides sit at the negotiating table, to get the Houthi rebels to be part of this Geneva process and, at the same time, to ensure that the two sides sit at the negotiating table, to get the Houthi rebels to be part of this Geneva process, and at the same time , Mr President, to give our competition as a European Union to try to achieve a Yemen that is stable, that lives in peace and that is as far away from extremism as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 221, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Neena GILL", "mepid": "4533", "text": "   – Mr President, it is high time that we debated Yemen given the neglect of this crisis politically and financially by the European Union and the Member States.

I believe Europe has been compromised because of the arms sales to Saudi Arabia, including by the UK’s Tory government, and it risks being complicit in possible war crimes in Yemen. I believe we really have to stand up in a meaningful way and stop selling arms to Saudi Arabia.  Along with other colleagues, I deeply regret that the Geneva consultations had to be abandoned last Saturday, so I have some questions for the Commissioner. Three points. Firstly, we need a ceasefire to stop the killings and move from hostilities to negotiation. What has the EEAS done to find a political solution to the conflict? Secondly, what are the outcomes of the political consultations on regional issues with Iran on Yemen?

I am proud to be standing here to defend the Committee on the Environment’s position on legislation that respects our climate targets, the environment, public health, industry and competitiveness. I am proud because together we realised that the way forward is to ensure the environmental integrity of the industry as a whole. We agreed that real driving emissions are a necessity, and that any emission values that the European Commission bases itself on have to be measured values and not simply values declared by the car manufacturers. We agreed that we have to move from measuring emissions at the tail pipe to analysing the whole life cycle of a vehicle. That, together with the well—to—wheels approach, can really promote cleaner technology and cleaner fuels. We agreed that investment in recharging infrastructure is to be promoted, and battery and battery cell manufacturing close to vehicle manufacturing sites should be supported. I am for more ambition than what the European Commission is proposing. I am for more ambition, because we have studies that clearly show that we need to take decisive action. More ambition will stimulate innovation and investment in the European Union. It will create jobs in the years to come, particularly if the European Union embarks on a long-term strategy that seriously attracts battery production investments to the European Union. This is confirmed by the European Commission itself. I did not want to speak about numbers, but I want to set the record straight. Let’s take a 40% CO2 reduction: we would be creating 69 000 jobs in the EU if we imported batteries from outside the European Union. If we had to produce batteries within the EU, we would be creating 92 000 jobs. With a 40% CO2 reduction, there would be 12 000 fewer jobs in the automotive sector over a period of 12 years until 2030. However, at the same time, in its blueprint for cooperation on skills and the automotive sector, the Commission is saying that there will be 900 000 employees, who will retire or leave the sector between 2017 and 2025. Because workers are a priority, we are proposing a gradual transition complemented by targeted programmes to ensure that no one is impacted negatively. An ambitious proposal is all about car manufacturers having the right incentive to invest and create quality jobs right here in the European Union. I ask two questions:  why are car manufacturers investing seven times as much outside the European Union as they do within the European Union when it comes to cleaner cars? Why are car manufacturers, telling their workers’ councils that they cannot invest in battery production in the EU because of high salary costs, but then Chinese companies open battery production sites in the EU paying EU salaries. As far as I’m concerned, the answer is simple: there aren’t the right incentives for the industry to invest in cleaner cars. And we have a choice: we have a choice between attracting investment to the European Union or letting other continents take the lead, with all the disruptive effects that this will have on our industry, on our companies and our small producers, our environment and our cities. This is the time to act. This is the time to show that, for us, it is not a question of industry versus the environment, but an issue of making sure that we address both the environment and industry together. We have the opportunity to act tomorrow in our vote in this plenary.

This is a key proposal to implement the 2030 climate and energy framework, to continue delivering on our commitments under the Paris Agreement and to contribute to the transition to a low carbon economy.  This is not just essential for the climate, but also for Europe’s economic prosperity and global competiveness. With the adoption of the legislative proposals on the 2030 climate and energy framework, thanks to the excellent work of all our institutions, the European Union is turning its global commitments into reality and is determined to continue as a world leader in the fight against climate change.  Under the Effort Sharing Regulation the Member States now have binding emission reduction targets up to 2030 in the sectors not included in the European Union Emissions Trading System – that is transport, buildings, agriculture and waste. Now it is time to make sure that at European level we have the right regulatory framework in place to contribute to meeting these targets. With almost a quarter of the European Union’s total greenhouse gas emissions coming from transport, this sector has a vital role to play in this transition. While Europe has reduced its emissions by some 23% since 1990, road transport emissions have grown by about 20% and today, transport accounts for more than 20% of Europe’s total emissions and this continues to grow.  The Commission’s legislative proposal setting the new CO2 standards for cars and vans for post-2020 is therefore an essential instrument to address this. Your vote tomorrow is instrumental to allow the adoption of the proposal during the current legislative term and we need to give a clear and stable regulatory signal to industry as soon as possible because this will stimulate the right investments in the transition towards zero emission mobility.  I want to thank the rapporteur, Ms Dalli, for her hard work on this proposal, putting together the position of this Parliament, as well as for our constructive discussions and cooperation. I would also like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their work.  I want to underline that the Commission proposal, underpinned by a thorough impact assessment, is both ambitious and realistic. It strikes the right balance between the three main policy objectives that cannot be considered in isolation: firstly, achieving environmental benefits, secondly, bringing savings for consumers and finally, safeguarding employment and competitiveness in the European Union.  The Commission proposal allows for a smooth, gradual and realistic transition to zero emission vehicles. The pace of the transition is essential, as the automotive sector is crucial for Europe’s prosperity, providing jobs for 12 million people in manufacturing, sales, maintenance and transport and accounting for 4% of gross domestic product.  We need to give sufficient time to achieve this reformation, to undertake the necessary investments and to reskill and upskill the workers in the current automotive supply chain. Our target will have positive impacts on the overall economy. At the same time, the number of jobs will remain stable in the automotive sector.  Our proposal will also bring significant environmental benefits. The proposal is projected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from road transport by around 22% between 2005 and 2030, contributing to our necessary efforts to implement the Paris Agreement. We have already agreed, or proposed, additional policies which will further reduce emissions from this sector, including the recently agreed Renewable Energy Directive, as well as the proposal on CO2 standards for heavy duty vehicles, the revised Eurovignette and the Clean Vehicles and Combined Transport Directives.  From the side of consumers, the 30% target will bring significant economic benefits. Consumers will save money – up to EUR 400 for the average new car bought in 2025 and more than EUR 1 400 in 2030.  Let me conclude by saying once again that the Commission remains fully supportive of the efforts of Parliament and the Council to conclude positive discussions on this proposal still this year. I look forward to continuing to work with you on the proposal and bringing it to a positive successful conclusion. This is what our citizens, our consumers, our companies and our workers expect from all of us.

All the proposals we will vote on tomorrow will help to achieve our climate targets. The question, however, is: what happens if we try to overshoot the mark once again? In other words, what do the excessive demands of some colleagues mean for consumers, the economy and jobs? The answer is very clear: they would be devastating. The softening of the 45% target from the Committee on the Environment to the 40% target with a binding electric quota will not change this much. The punishment system for zero- and low-emission vehicles alone will cost us dearly. The Commission has calculated what the proposal of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy would mean. The economy would lose EUR 1 450 if a vehicle were sold, every consumer would have to pay EUR 1 000, and 60 000 people would lose their jobs. It is often said here that new jobs might also be created and that people could simply be put into retraining. I have met with the representatives of the trade unions and industry on this, and it is quite clear that thousands of jobs will be lost. We must prevent this. Only in the European Parliament has this news still not got it right. I firmly believe that we can define ambitious objectives, protect the climate and, at the same time, strengthen the competitiveness of our industry and thus safeguard jobs in Europe.

That would be good for the climate, that would be good for the consumer, and it would also be good for the workers.

Some, like Mr Gieseke, argue that increased ambition will lead to a loss of jobs. Well, it’s not the case. The Commission’s own impact assessment states that with a 40% reduction, total EU employment will increase by 69 000 to 92 000 jobs. In any case, colleagues, regardless of electrification, if you look at what will go on in the sector on everything that is to do with automation and digitalisation, fundamental changes need to occur in the sector. That’s why I am so proud that, under the leadership of Ms Dalli, there are many issues on just transition within the proposal of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) that we should all support. What workers should be really be afraid of is that we lose out in the automotive sector; we lose our leadership on technology. Ms Dalli mentioned it already. Why are European car manufacturers making so much effort in China to make electric cars and not do so within Europe? What do we want? To be left with all technology that is killing our people because of the effect on climate and air quality? That’s why we need to have ambition.

We took into account the different possibilities of the different countries. That, I think, is fair. What we are now doing is trying to take a further step, and this step, if you look at the figures, is very important. If we fail in transport, then transport will kick back on effort sharing, on agriculture and on the budgets of the Member States if they are not able to reach the goals. That is what we are actually now deciding on; we are deciding on the way in which we will go forward. Therefore, if you look at the figures, transport is the only part of CO2 that is rising.

I have to tell you, I cannot see that. You said only last week that you are not adjusting the European Union's overall climate objective to the Paris Agreement as intended – three years after Paris. The EU Commission has failed to adjust its own climate targets and is heading to Katowice without an adjusted target. It is therefore not at all surprising that you are not ambitious in this important area of legislation that we are discussing today. Their own experts have told them that a CO2 reduction target for the automotive industry must be at least 60% by 2030. They have submitted 30% by 2030. The recommendations of science and the Commission's proposals have never diverged so far during the time when I am co-advising on climate policy.  I must also thank the rapporteur, Mrs Dalli, who has really achieved something good with the compromise we have reached in the Committee on the Environment. However, this compromise must now at least be defended, so that we can see if we want to represent something good from this House in the international debate. The car industry, together with some governments, is on the brakes. This is not surprising, it has a system, as we have often experienced. But the trade unions, Mr Gieseke, are already discussing something differently. We have heard from the trade unions that they know full well that our industry will be left behind in international markets if we do not engage ambitiously and consistently in innovation, climate protection and environmentally friendly cars. The workplace argument has played a very big role all along. And I want to tell you that I have rarely seen in a debate such a manipulative approach to figures as these job losses as in recent weeks. It is outrageous to operate with figures on job losses that would occur if we were to discuss reduction targets such as 80% by 2030. No one has ever discussed this dimension, and yet Mr Gieseke is arguing in this way. Job losses, which will affect industry in the European Union in the foreseeable future, are due to digitisation and increased productivity, as always.  And there is no interference at all from you, Mr Gieseke. Scaremongering about climate protection is what you are doing, and that ultimately leads to The European markets being taken over by Chinese manufacturers.

Mrs Harms, you said that there was never any mention of 80%, but your group has already tabled 75%. That is not so far away from 80%, so really not. We have had Miriam Dalli's proposals: 50%. We have the committee proposal of 45%. And then the independent analysis of the European Commission, which I hold in high esteem, says that we will then have job losses and losses for the economy in Europe. That is why it is good that we are now moving on another piece and that many groups no longer support this 45%. I would also like to ask that we look again at the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment on the malus.

Once we are going to discuss agriculture I know pretty well the agriculture sector will say, not us. Okay, then we need to do it where it can be done. And the transport sector, within the transport sector, CO2 standards on cars is the most cost—efficient measure we can take now. So we should do that, and even the Commission did some studies on it. One of them was a study which showed that if you go to higher targets, with these being 6% emission reduction annually, then you have the highest societal savings. By the way, the Commission forgot to publish this one right away – later on corrected it, but forgot to publish it. That can happen of course – pure coincidence. Then last week’s non—paper – even that paper showed that with the reduction target that the Committee on the Environment (ENVI) is proposing, 151 000 more jobs will be created.

The most effective solutions are those which are widely accepted not so much by producers, but above all by consumers, also by the wealth of their portfolios. Too high a reduction rate can raise such a price too rigorously, and as a result, it can, in countries where there are lower incomes, temporarily even increase CO2 emissions, because there will be no money to buy new, relatively more expensive cars.

It is quite clear that the car industry must play its part in reducing emissions. Europe must become a pioneer in clean transport. But we still have to remember that the car industry alone cannot solve this, especially when we talk about issues that will come into force in decades' time. We must be able to cut transport emissions much more quickly.  At present, more than a quarter of Europe's emissions come from transport. We know that, according to the forecast, traffic volumes will only increase and transport emissions will be the only sector where emissions have also increased throughout Europe over the decades. In other things, the challenge is very big and requires much more than just solutions from the car industry. The fastest way to cut emissions is to use renewable sustainable fuels in cars that are already in existence, because it will take decades for the car fleet to reinsert.  What I do not like about this proposal is that it drives electric cars so strongly. Electrification will play a very big role in the future and already especially in cities, but at the moment the production of electric cars is not sustainable either.

The transition to zero-emission mobility needs to happen during the next decades. However, this transition should happen at the right pace to allow sufficient time for the re-skilling of workers in the supply chain. And a smooth transition is particularly important for the many small and medium-sized enterprises operating in this sector, which are the backbone of the economy in many regions. Some Members addressed the issue of the introduction of a malus in the zero and low—emission vehicles incentive mechanism, in particular Mr Liese and Ms Ayuso. The Commission proposal contains a new mechanism incentivising manufacturers to put more zero and low—emission vehicles on the European Union market. It leaves manufacturers the choice as to how they compose their fleet but provides this benefit for those choosing to go for zero and low—emission vehicles. Adding a malus would mean that manufacturers meeting their CO2 targets could actually be penalised if they do not meet the benchmark, and analyses also show that the economic impacts depend on the combination of the target level and a possible bonus/malus benchmark for zero-emission or low-emission vehicles. With the increased penetration of zero and low—emission vehicles, driven by the high bonus/malus benchmark level, less effort will be needed in improving the efficiency of conventional vehicles to meet the fleet-wide CO2 targets. And this results in a projected shift towards larger segments for conventional vehicles, leading to an increase in the net economic costs for consumers. Some Members commented on the non-paper on assessment of higher ambition levels, produced by the Commission, and my friend Bas Eickhout actually said it was a political document. Well, I would point out that the Commission services have not manipulated any calculations and are not misleading the co—legislator: the non—paper clearly and objectively presents the results of recent analytical work and it aims to inform the ongoing decision-making process on the impact of options not considered in the impact assessments. The non—paper’s analysis is therefore only factual. It is fully transparent and based on the same methodological approach: as in the impact assessments, we provided all the necessary underlying background. In particular, the non—paper confirms that the only impact on jobs up to 2030 is positive for more ambitious scenarios. However, it also points to the fact that the transition towards zero-emission mobility will lead to differences between sectors. While overall employment increases with the level of ambition, existing jobs in the automotive sector related to the combustion engine risk being lost if the transition is too fast. The non-paper also confirms the key role of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in this respect, allowing a transition to zero-emission vehicles while limiting automotive job impacts. In conclusion, I want to thank all of you for the very interesting debate tonight and I am looking forward to tomorrow’s vote. I am also confident that the Council and the leadership of the Austrian Presidency will be able to reach an agreement on a general approach at the Environment Council next week and that a final positive political agreement among the co—legislators can be found before the end of the year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 301, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Pavel TELIČKA", "mepid": "124706", "text": "  Thank you Commissioner.

Seriously, is this the level of the debate about such important legislation? What I heard tonight is not necessarily always based on fact. To the MEPs who think that by going low on ambition they are doing the industry a favour, I ask you to look at what is going on around you. See what is happening in Japan, see what is happening in China, see what our cities are doing, and see what our governments are doing. Case in point: the Danish Government is saying that it will ban gasoline and diesel cars by 2030. This is what is happening at this point in time, and not all EPP Members necessarily agree with this or are happy with this, but to come here tonight and say that having ambition going to 40% will be devastating really shows how much some people are out of touch. I will refer colleagues to what the chief of a major trade union in Germany said: that 40% is achievable. He said that infrastructure needs to move forward, and that is something we agree upon and that we also addressed in the environment position. We also heard about the push towards one technology over the other. It is not true. If we are speaking about a 40% CO2 reduction, let’s be factual with people. We are talking about a 10% battery electric vehicle market share by 2030. It does not mean that we are going towards battery electric vehicles overnight. It means that there will be a large share of efficient internal combustion engines and a large share of plug-in hybrids, which are labour—intensive and which require more employees across the European Union.

Therefore, their harmful effects on the environment should be measured by a comprehensive efficiency indicator, calculated as the ratio of the effectiveness of the various links in this chain. A comprehensive estimate of the efficiency of vehicles with internal combustion engines is the production of fuels in refineries (petrol or oil) from crude oil with an energy efficiency equal to, on average, about 50%, and then used in vehicles with efficiency for mechanical propulsion, i.e. about 20%, which gives a final efficiency of about 10%. In the case of electric motor vehicle propulsion, we can come out with about 40% of the energy efficiency of electricity generation in the energy chain and about 80% of the energy efficiency of its use, which will estimate the final efficiency of the vehicle at about 30%. As you can see, the energy efficiency of \"electricians\" here would be about three times higher than the energy efficiency of internal combustion vehicles. Assuming that a 1% efficiency increase is about a two% reduction in CO2 emissions, we can see that a complete transition to electro-mobility would result in a reduction in CO2 emissions of around 40%. However, the transition to electro-mobility involves a number of difficulties to overcome. The capacity of power plants should be significantly increased and new power plants built.

When it comes to the supposedly temporary system for cross-border VAT in Europe, that criticism has surely been warranted. For 25 years, nothing really happened. Think about that: a quarter of a century has gone by with a patchwork of a system for cross-border VAT in Europe, full of loopholes, mismatches between 28 different systems of VAT and outright black holes where even authorities didn’t know how to accurately assess VAT dues. This system of compromises upon compromises and patchwork upon patchwork has been a contributing factor to the growing VAT gap in Europe. The problem has now reached a shocking and completely unacceptable scale, with an annual VAT gap of around EUR 150 billion every single year. Now VAT is of course short for value—added tax, but today I would propose that VAT might also be short for value—added talk, because now apparently the right politicians have started talking to each other and action has indeed followed. Commissioner Moscovici has spearheaded a much—needed reform of the EU VAT system, and we have had many constructive and productive talks with the Commissioner and his team. In these talks, we have found workable solutions to a range of specific problems with the current VAT model in Europe. Now, with the adoption of these new measures, as proposed by the Commission and amended by Parliament, we can reduce the current VAT gap in Europe by upwards of EUR 41 billion a year, and at the same time ease the administrative burden for trusted companies who pay their fair taxes by an additional EUR 1 billion a year. Now that is only the start, we have some way to go, but it’s an ambitious and highly effective start. First of all, we will establish the legal cornerstone for a new and defined EU VAT system. Secondly, we will be adopting a number of urgently needed quick fixes to the current VAT system. And finally, we will introduce a new safeguard against cross—border VAT fraud in the form of certified taxable person status. However, before a definitive new VAT system can be put in place, we need to address a number of urgent problems in the current system. These come in the form of four so—called quick fixes and will resolve long—standing issues related to the so-called call—off stock arrangements, where goods from one supplier are stored in the location of the customer but ownership of the goods is not transferred until the exact moment of use. Here regulation and interpretation of rules vary between Member States, which leads to legal uncertainty and to administrative burdens. Now we will ensure simplified administrative requirements that will clarify legal requirements and ease cross—border sales. We will also introduce simplified procedures for so—called chain transactions, where again a problem of legal uncertainty as to where VAT is ascribed in transactions between two or more companies currently exists. And finally, we will add simplification in relation to the proof of transport between companies and clarify that VAT numbers must be duly recorded. However, these quick fixes and simplifications cannot stand alone. This is very important. By introducing the status of a certified taxable person, we ensure that trustworthy companies who dutifully pay their fair taxes will be able to benefit from the simplified procedures for cross-border VAT, which will effectively cut down their administrative costs. It will also free up resources for Member States’ authorities to more effectively scrutinise companies which have previously failed to pay their taxes. It will also give a clear incentive for businesses not only to obtain the status of a certified taxable person, but also to maintain that status. As the European Parliament rapporteur, I urge Member States to fully implement the CTP provisions as proposed by the Commission and Parliament. I’m a little disappointed by the decision today by the Economic and Financial Affairs Council (Ecofin) in that regard. Talking frankly, the quick fixes and running – as some have been tempted to do on the Council side – are extremely ill-advised. This is a package and this must be adopted in its entirety. Let’s not waste this opportunity by being reckless and throwing the door open to simplification of VAT requirements to all corners. That would undermine the very purpose of these new initiatives and risk opening a new avenue for VAT fraud in Europe, and that would be the responsibility of the Council if they did so. I would like to commend the Commission, and Commissioner Moscovici and his team, for their dedication and excellent work in paving the way for a definitive VAT system. I would also like to thank the shadows from each political group for their constructive approach, their cooperation on this file and their support in ensuring a very large majority for the adoption of these new measures in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). I look forward to our ensuing debate on this topic, and hopefully to the swift adoption of these urgently needed improvements of the VAT system in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 311, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Tibor SZANYI", "mepid": "124703", "text": "  Artist. - Mr President, I would like to thank you for your support. First of all, I would like to thank the shadow reporters for their more constructive cooperation than is usual in the negotiation of such dossiers. I am pleased that, as a result of professional work that goes beyond partisan interests, we can discuss here today a report adopted by almost full consensus in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.  I trust that in tomorrow's vote we will also be able to act in a similar way in order to combat VAT fraud and to develop a definitive VAT system that has been going on for many decades.  The EU VAT system is an important tool for the single internal market and has made a major contribution to promoting trade within the European Union. However, as the current system of taxation of trade between Member States has not been able to keep pace with the globalisation and digitisation of the economy, the European Commission has proposed to amend the Directive.  There is a great deal of agreement within the European Parliament that the fragmentation of the current VAT system is a major obstacle to the proper functioning of the single internal market. However, it is a great step forward that under the new system, the privileges of individual Member States based on previous privileges will be abolished and that everyone can decide on their own VAT rate system on the basis of the same rules.  The proposal supported by the report therefore does not limit the current flexibility of The Member States in setting vat rates, on the contrary: it introduces harmonised and less restrictive rules, for example by introducing a so-called negative list instead of supplementing an already long list of goods and services to which a reduced rate of taxation can be applied. So let's just say that we can't be subject to a discounted rate. The new system therefore guarantees member states more freedom to decide which products they wish to tax at a reduced rate.  At the same time, however, a weighted average of 12% will be achieved in all Member States, taking into account all VAT rate, in order to ensure budgetary resources and avoid harmful tax competition. The political will to have not only a lower but also a cap on the standard VAT rate, namely 15% and 25%, will finally be stated. In addition to the general rate, each Member State will be able to apply two preferential rates and one rate between zero and 5%, in order to eliminate the further discrimination between Member States mentioned above.  I know that some of my fellow Members would have been even more sympathetic if we had voted with fewer key options, and perhaps this could be a next step in the future, but I would also like to reassure colleagues that the report specifically calls for the creation of an INFORMATION portal at EU level, which should provide accurate information on vat systems in all Member States, thereby helping small and medium-sized enterprises in particular.  As rapporteur, it was also of the utmost importance to me that the reduced rate should be applied for the benefit of final consumers and for the support of small and medium-sized enterprises. It was particularly important for the Socialists and Democrats group that, when applying reduced tax rates, social and environmental aspects should be taken into account by the Member States and that we should not allow harmful or luxury products to be benefited.  However, I must underline here that one of the key elements of the proposal for a definitive VAT system is that the VAT system for the taxation of trade between Member States will be based on the taxation of the Member State of destination.

EUR 150 billion per year is lost every year at the level of the European Union.  We must recognise that Member States have been improving VAT collection throughout the European Union, but such a loss for national budgets remains unacceptable, especially when EUR 50 billion of this is lining the pockets of criminals and probably even terrorists.  These figures show that the reform of the current European Union VAT system, combined with better cooperation at European Union level, are needed so that Member States can make full use of VAT revenues in their budgets. In April 2016, the European Commission presented a communication on an action plan on VAT in which it set out the pathway to the creation of a single European Union VAT area. The Commission announced that it would present a number of proposal for the fundamental reform of the EU VAT system over the coming months with the objective of making the VAT system simpler, more fraud-proof and more business friendly. This programme of reforms included the two proposals you will vote on tomorrow, namely the proposal adopted by the Commission on 4 October 2017, which introduces the cornerstones of the future definitive VAT system, together with four short—term improvements, or quick—fixes, to the current VAT rules in relation to cross—border trade in goods, and a proposal granting more flexibility for Member States to define reduced VAT rates. Considering the complexity of the past, the major subjects have been addressed step-by-step in 2016, but they all contribute to the same objective: to create a single VAT area that provides for a level playing field for business; to create a single VAT area that is fraud-proof; and to treat Member States equally and grant them more freedom in setting VAT rates.  To start with the first objective, I would remind you that our current VAT system is fragmented and complex to apply for the growing number of businesses operating across borders in the European Union. Such businesses have VAT compliance costs 11% higher than businesses whose main activities are domestic. We have to open the borders of VAT and create a real single VAT area for European Union companies. The proposals adopted in October 2017 presented the cornerstone for a new definitive VAT system, based on the principle of taxation in the Member State of destination, which will result in taxing cross-border sales or goods in the same way as domestic sales.  These proposals also contain four so-called quick fixes, which have been requested by businesses, stakeholders and Member States. The quick fixes aim to address specific problems encountered by business and tax authorities within the current VAT system related to the lack of clear and simple rules, or even the absence of any rules at all. In this respect, the Commission welcomes the support of the European Parliament and the draft report on this proposal in relation to the quick fixes, but also the cornerstone of the definitive VAT system and the concept of certified taxable persons. In May 2018, the Commission complimented these proposals by adopting a proposal on the detailed technical provisions for implementing the definitive VAT system. The Commission also adopted, in January 2018, measures to simplify VAT procedures for SMEs, which represent 99% of European Union business. We also welcome the support of the Parliament in this resolution, which was adopted on 11 September and we are confident that an agreement can be agreed soon in the Council. We have no time to lose. We estimate that this proposal will result in a compliance cost reduction of up to 11% for SMEs.  The second main objective of our VAT reform is to address the unacceptable problem of VAT cross-border fraud, which is estimated at around EU 50 billion per year. Before an agreement is concluded on the European Union definitive VAT regime, I am happy to say that – with the support of this Parliament – a first Commission proposal to address VAT fraud was already adopted in June 2018, only six months after its adoption by the Commission. It will enhance cooperation between tax administrations and law enforcement authorities and close loopholes in information sharing. It is the proof that, when there is political will, things can change quickly.  The last objective of the broad reform of the European Union VAT system is a full modernisation of the VAT rates policy. The VAT rates proposal is directly linked to the definitive VAT system in which Member States may be accorded greater freedom to apply reduced VAT rates, because it will be based on taxation at destination. The VAT rates proposal is also linked to the definitive VAT system, because it provides a solution to the current unequal VAT treatment of Member States. It will resolve the issue of over 150 temporary reduced VAT rates currently in place, which are due to expire with the entry into force of the definitive VAT system, and which are currently only available to some of the Member States.  In a nutshell, we are suggesting applying the subsidiarity principle to give more flexibility to Member States in a fair manner, in order to apply reduced rates in the sectors of their choice, according to their own national priorities.  On the other hand, our proposal sets a frame aiming to prevent both excessive revenue losses for Member States, and distortion of competition. Furthermore, in the future, reduced rates must clearly be of benefit to citizens, because they are the final consumers paying the VAT. Where common rules lead to a better outcome, we work together with the Member States. Where common rules are unnecessary, and rule—making can be achieved better at Member State level, the Commission steps back.  To conclude, let me say that behind the apparent complexity of some proposals, the reform of the European Union VAT system is a win-win situation for both Member States, revenues and European businesses. More money to spend for public services, and more money to invest for businesses. With the support of Parliament, the adoption of these proposals before the European elections will show citizens the added value of the European Union and the benefits of a real single market for VAT.

The temporary solution for the VAT system in cross-border operations was adopted 25 years ago and is a true example of how temporary solutions are becoming time-consuming. This proposal for amendments to the Directive introduces simplifications that are also a preparation for the establishment of a definitive VAT system, which previous speakers have already pointed out.  Entrepreneurs point out VAT and complicated VAT calculation as the main obstacle to cross-border business and the use of advantages in the single market. In particular, they list the additional costs they have to comply with different rules in each member state and of course we need to change that.  It is with these changes that we want to simplify and adapt more to the needs of the entrepreneurs. Rules for VAT calculation in cases of movement of goods and chain transactions are defined and levelled, and we know that these areas were the most common areas of VAT fraud. Likewise, the concept of a certified taxable person is being introduced, but I must point out here that the Commission needs to further clarify and establish criteria for establishing this status in order to be used evenly at the level of all Member States and for states to recognise this status with each other.

Simplicity lies in the choice of a 15% floor and a 25% ceiling. It is also a simplification that results in a much more flexible procedure than unanimity in defining reduced rates. This is yet another simplification of what is still to be created, that is, a system of certified tax payers, which will allow access to much less cumbersome procedures and facilitate the payment of VAT in cross-border transactions. Efficiency, on the other hand, lies in the introduction of a comprehensive multilingual portal through which businesses and citizens can understand the system. Efficiency also requires a system of mechanism for resolving conflicts between states.  There is now another step, which will also be guided by efficiency and simplicity, namely the principle of taxation in the destination state, one of the means of combating fraud estimated at 50 billion euros in this area.

It is now more than difficult for businesses and tax authorities to find the right way through the jungle of tax rates, rules and jurisprudence. But fraudsters know exactly how to exploit the system.

The report by Mr Szanyi makes progress in three crucial areas: firstly, Member States shall adopt a maximum of two reduced rates, which shall not be lower than 5%. These reduced rates would only be allowed for goods, the supply of which is in the genuine public interest. This will reduce dispersion in the VAT rates across the EU and benefit final consumers.  Secondly, the weighted average VAT rate should be at least 12%. Thirdly, while the derogations and the reduced rates will continue to be determined by individual Member States, they will also be available to exporters from all other Member States. Together, these changes will help achieve a level playing field in the single market, eliminate distortions and allow for a consistent application of the country of destination principle. At the same time, they will give more freedom to Member States in fixing the national VAT rates according to their priorities.  The other report by Mr Kofod aims at harmonising and simplifying certain rules in the VAT system. In particular, harmonising rules in VAT treatment of chain transactions will significantly reduce the scope for VAT fraud across the EU. This is especially true when it comes to so-called ‘triangular transactions’ or ‘carousel schemes’, which had been one of the most popular VAT fraud schemes in intra-Community trade.

Profits made in European Member States are not even channelled into tax havens through such ingenious constructions. Through VAT carousels, my VAT is going to charge third parties to put it in their own pocket instead of transferning it to the treasury where they were supposed to arrive. In the case of VAT fraud, we can no longer speak of loopholes. It's so common and it happens on such a large scale that we just don't see the net through the cracks anymore. Each year, Member States of the Union together collect more than EUR 1000 billion in VAT revenue, but that could and should be much more. In 2016, the difference between revenue and revenue in the end was around EUR 147 billion, we have already heard the figure this evening. For my country of Belgium, this amounts to EUR 3.3 billion. I repeat: EUR 3.3 billion. Tackling VAT fraud, ladies and gentlemen, requires political courage and European action. It cannot be explained that we in Europe have been working with some sort of transitional regime for cross-border transactions between companies for 24 years. For 24 years, vat carousels went crazy with an invoice for the European Member States of EUR 50 billion. Every year. So it's not 5 for 12, it's not 5 after 12, lunch is actually long gone.

However, just a note of caution: this depends on how quickly the governments of the 28 Member States approve and implement this agreement. Large—scale VAT fraud means EUR 50 billion lost from national budgets each year because of the complexities with differing rules – money that could have been better spent on housing, better schools and improved health-care facilities. However, national tax authorities on their own have lacked the resources to tackle cross—border VAT fraud thoroughly. One big flaw is the system of VAT refund for exported goods. Far too often, this system has been abused, leading to carousel VAT fraud. This can be addressed only if we have a clear, automated, definitive and EU—wide VAT system. Particularly where there are disputes, a simple EU—wide VAT dispute resolution mechanism is urgently needed. Therefore, I welcome today the fact that agreement has been reached in the Council to move towards a strong, harmonised, definitive VAT system.

There is significant progress that we have already made, because, since 2015, new rules for sales of e—services online came into force which allows Member States to collect VAT where the consumer is based, through a one—stop shop. Member States have also now agreed to extend this new system to services and goods online, delivering another boost for VAT collection in the European Union. As I mentioned in the introduction, the European Union has also recently agreed on a ground—breaking new framework to exchange more information and boost cooperation between national tax authorities and law enforcement authorities.  However, after all the fundamental reform, a European Union VAT definitive system is still to be adopted by the Council. In his State of the Union speech, President Juncker called for an end of unanimity in taxation policy. Unanimity can block proposals that are in the interests of the majority and thus prevent companies and citizens from benefiting from a full single market.  The Commission will play its role in the reflection towards a chain of rules by presenting a communication in the coming months on qualified majority voting in the field of taxation. With your support, I am confident that the two proposals you will vote on will benefit from broad support and that progress can be achieved on all VAT proposals in the coming months.  Finally, in reply to the question from Mr Arthuis, yes, the horse sector can benefit from VAT reduced rates if the Member State so decides.  Commission Statement (in writing) The Commission and the Council are aware of a certain divergence in the VAT treatment of independent groups of persons that pool their services and share costs between their members. The Council and the Commission recognize the need to clarify such VAT rules on independent groups of persons.

I am grateful to have this opportunity.  First, I would like to express my sympathy to Ms Forenza, who was attacked in Bari a week ago, and who informed us on Monday at the opening session. Such attacks, especially against a Member of the European Parliament and her staff, have no place in Europe. It is our joint responsibility to safeguard the values on which the Union is founded. EU values are the backbone of the Union and encompass pluralism, tolerance, justice and fundamental rights. Among the fundamental rights, the Charter of Fundamental Rights includes freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly. Any politically motivated attack on a peaceful demonstration is an attack on our common values.  The use of violence for political reasons to forbid others to express their ideas is unjustifiable in our open democratic societies. We are appalled by the most recent violent incidents in several Member States. Evidence from different sources, such as the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and the Council of Europe, confirms an alarming increase in intolerance and hatred in Europe. Whatever the source might be, let me be clear that there is no justification for this. At EU level, the Council attaches great importance to ensuring the effective transposition and implementation of the Framework Decision on Combating Racism and Xenophobia and other relevant hate crime laws at national level. The Council constantly calls upon Member States to develop effective methods to report and ensure proper recording of hate crimes. At national level, it is for law enforcement authorities and the national courts to protect fundamental rights when these are attacked by political extremists.  Let me also underline the important role of education and youth work. In my capacity as a Youth Minister, I want to stress the need to develop democratic resilience, media literacy, tolerance, critical thinking and conflict resolution skills in learning processes. I would like to conclude by stressing how important it is to prevent our societies from becoming dominated by hatred. We are therefore obliged to take all incidents of this kind seriously and never ignore them.

According to the latest data we have, there are roughly four anti-Semitic incidents per day in France, the United Kingdom and Germany. We expect Member States to act forcefully against crimes committed by neo—Nazi groups – whether in the streets, in football arenas or in the targeting of places of worship or asylum shelters. However, we also have to look at where this violence comes from. Societal polarisation has increased, not least in the social media. We read and talk to the like-minded, and this increases the polarisation of our societies. As a society, we need to step up action against racism, intolerance and the toxic narratives which are shrinking the space for well-informed and democratic discussion in the public sphere and are polarising our societies. We have our Charter of Fundamental Rights and we have to make clear that its basic principles really matter: that they are not negotiable. But we have to ensure that people in Europe can also relate to them. These principles should become an anchor in the fast-changing and sometimes confusing world. Simply, they should be the bedrock of our society. For me, I understand the key principles as follows: equality before the law; no tolerance for discrimination; freedom of speech, but with limits to exclude, for instance, speech calling for violence; freedom of religion within the limits of the legal order; and access to justice for all, not only the privileged or the rich. And finally, among the main principles, I want to mention the right of feeling secure, of feeling safe, but not at the expense of the safety of others. These principles can only work if they are applied and visible in people’s everyday lives. The Commission is leading the work on countering the increasingly worrying phenomenon of illegal online hate speech. We are working intensively with Member States to step up the implementation of EU law to combat racism and xenophobia and to ensure that prompt investigation, prosecution and proportionate sanctioning become a reality in the EU Member States. The intent is to be practical, and we are striving to make a difference on the ground. Our work with Member States includes the compilation of promising practices and guiding principles on key issues such as hate-crime training and hate-crime victim support. We will also present a comprehensive guidance document on the practical application of the Framework Decision on Combating Racism. I consider these issues very important because they also send strong signals that hate crime and illegal hate speech are not tolerated and will be penalised. We too, as individual politicians, have a role to play in avoiding divisive attitudes and in sticking to the norms. This is the moment to stand up for the principles of our Charter. And the independent media also have their role to play here: it is their responsibility to counter discourse that sows division, spreads disinformation and encourages exclusion. The media are also instrumental in holding politicians to account and in defining the limits of what is acceptable and what is unacceptable in society. The Commission is also tackling the worrying rise of far-right violent extremism under its radicalisation policies. The Radicalisation Awareness Network has dedicated, and will continue to dedicate, its efforts, inter alia, to training frontline practitioners – police officers and prison staff – on how to address far-right extremism and all manifestations of polarisation. Overall, I can assure you, honourable Members, that this is a priority issue for the Commission and that we are working with all the relevant actors, including in law enforcement, civil society and industry, especially the digital industry, to tackle all these problems not only through the law but also in our work to foster a more tolerant, safer and law-abiding society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 345, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Róża THUN UND HOHENSTEIN", "mepid": "96776", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Commissioner, i would like to thank you very much for I will recall the word that we all know, the word of St. John: \"There was a word at the beginning.\" And we all know that great things begin with the word, but terrible and vile things can also begin in the word, and we all know that the word can change into deeds.  Unfortunately, today we are witnessing verbal aggression in many places in our Union, dividing society into a better and worse sort, into patriots and traitors. Permission for hejt in audiovisual media, written and online. Stories of refugees bringing parasites and diseases. This is reminiscent of the mosthyde propaganda of the darkest moments in European history. And these words are often followed by the approval of fascist marches inciting violence, racism, homophobia. There are already excesses such as the burning of the Jew's cuckoo or the symbolic hanging of portraits of politicians, who clearly article the need to protect the weak, minorities and call for the observance of European values. We have examples of this in the Czech Republic, Poland, Hungary, Malta. In some countries, the public media sows hatred of the government's political opponents, in others the government does so personally.

Let us be clear about this: the multiple economic and institutional crises have led to the re-surface of the blackest stain in our history. We, as members of a democratic institution, cannot accept intolerance. For the sake and freedom of all, we must oppose nationalist violence by pursuing the fundamental principles enshrined in the Founding Treaties of the European Union.

It is these daily episodes, fuelled by the whirlwind of exacerbated hatred and propaganda slogans, in an endless campaign climate. A propaganda against migrants, against the Roma, against Afro-descendants, precisely Afrophobia, against Jews or Muslims, against minorities.

Of course, any kind of violence should be condemned, but it seems to me that Islamic and left—wing radicalism are much more relevant problems in today’s Europe, including when we talk about anti—Jewish violence.  It is very unfortunate that whenever ordinary people express their concern over immigrant or Islamic violence, they are immediately labelled fascists, racists and Nazis.

In this context, I would also like to point out that the danger to European democracy is not only from the far right, but also from the far left. I consider left-wing extremism to be no less pernicious than right-wing extremism. And there are still a number of Communist parties in Europe that are true emers of Marxism-Leninism, an ideology that is responsible for a comparable number of people's lives. Every democracy is fragile and vulnerable by nature, so we must take due care of our European one, so that it does not happen that it flows through our fingers.

We should speak more about the breeding ground, which is fear, which is poverty, which is uncertainty, which is confusion. People in Europe went through the financial crisis. Some Member States and some societies were more affected, some less. People are still stressed by the migration crisis of 2015 and 2016, which was unprecedented. We were not ready for that. We are stressed by terrorist attacks, we have a lot of uncertainty in our society due to something which sounds positive but which can have negative consequences on many people and that is the technological revolution. People have stopped understanding the world and they ask for more security and more certainty. My question is, why we as democrats, we who say clearly that aggression and violence is intolerable, that collective guilt is unacceptable, why are we not able to reach out to these people and to offer them more security and more certainty? Why do these people come and more and more believe the populist parties and the people who provide them with easy solutions, which might lead to another tragedy in Europe? I think that we should not only deal with the consequences – and this was the debate about the consequences here in Parliament – but we should speak more about the sources, about the breeding ground.  So I will do this, at least in my work, because I am in very frequent contact with normal citizens, with these people which have senior age. They have said to me: we fear, we are uncertain and we want our sons and our grandsons to have a peaceful life in Europe. We have to offer this to the people and we have to take lessons from history and consider seriously what the new elements are. I already touched upon this, it is the digital revolution. Just imagine if the totalitarian regimes of the past, and I will not name them because I don’t want to get into the passionate debate again, but what if they had this digital highway for propaganda? It would be much more efficient, much more easy to capture societies and to come with very dangerous proposals which, as we know, were realised.  This digital world enables us to reach for very good things and bad things at the same time. Here, I would say, we should be able to alert society because the passive majority, if it remains passive, will enable the evil again to rule the EU. I think that this is our task: to alert people. You know that we have the Code of Conduct against hate crime and hate speech. We are doing a lot against disinformation and sometimes when I see the statistical figures showing the increase of aggressivity and violence, I ask myself, is it really true that evil is so automatic and so strong and the good must be organised? I think that we should ask ourselves these questions and ask ourselves what are the most efficient instruments, how to address the majority of people, the honest people who need to have the option for their electoral preferences, to vote for the people who offer something other than aggression and violence.  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much once again for this debate.

However, I’m very pleased that this debate is taking place since voting rights is a key issue for the committee of which I am Chair, namely the Committee on Petitions, in this House.  Participation in the democratic life of the EU and the electoral rights of EU citizens living abroad in another Member State in the Union is frequently the subject of petitions to my committee. Six Member States – namely Cyprus, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Malta and the United Kingdom – systematically deprive their nationals of the right to vote in national elections due to their residence in another Member State. The same Member States also disenfranchise their nationals in European elections if they live permanently in a third country.  However, the right to vote is a fundamental right. Therefore, depriving citizens of the right to vote once they move to another EU Member State is effectively equivalent to punishing these citizens for having exercised their right to free movement in the Union.  These persons very often feel like second—class citizens. These practices can change their whole lives without giving them the opportunity to participate, which was the case for all the British citizens who were not allowed to participate in the referendum about Brexit because they had lived in another Member State for some time. However, they were directly affected by the result when Brexit was a fact. It is therefore high time that the Member States in this Union address this very concrete concern because disenfranchisement has huge consequences for all the individuals concerned. The loss of electoral rights for citizens moving to another Member State can be seen as an infringement upon freedom of movement under EU law. It could potentially stop EU citizens from exercising their right to free movement in the Union. Indeed, the discouraging effect in each individual case may be difficult to prove, but the violation of EU citizenship rights does not require statistical or other evidence. It’s enough to read the petitions to our committee. The main justification for disenfranchisement, that citizens living abroad no longer have sufficient links with their home country, seems completely outdated in the globalised world of today. We are interconnected with each other. The nationality bond with a state is still the main connecting factor for the rights and obligations of each citizen, but citizens resident abroad still have obligations deriving from their nationality so they should also be conferred their corresponding rights. In addition, there has been a Eurobarometer on electoral rights, where two—thirds of the respondents thought that it was not at all justified that people lose the right to vote in national elections in their country simply because they reside in another EU country.  The Committee on Petitions considers that EU citizens who move to reside in another Member State should have the possibility to exercise their right to vote in the national elections of their country of origin. The committee therefore calls on those Member States that disenfranchise nationals who choose to live for an extended period in another Member State to ease the conditions for these nationals and preserve their right to vote in national elections. The committee is aware of the fact that the decision on who is conferred the right to vote in national and European elections lies with the Member States. Nevertheless, we also know that the problem of the disenfranchisement of voting rights has been known for a long time. It is therefore high time to take action now.  We therefore urge the Commission to propose specific measures for removing any obstacles to free movement. Especially in view of the upcoming elections in May next year, we must safeguard the right of all EU citizens to choose to vote either in their Member State of origin or in the host Member State where they reside. I look forward to hearing your answers to the questions put forward by the Committee on Petitions.

The Union itself is founded on the value of respect for democracy. For the Council, increasing and improving citizens’ participation in the democratic life of the Union is a priority and all European institutions and Member States should join forces to achieve this objective.  The Presidency notes the concerns voiced by Ms Wikström, reflecting the concern of the authors of the petition regarding the consequences of the disenfranchisement of voting rights in national elections in some Member States in relation to the exercise of the freedom of movement. However, the Treaties do not confer any power to the Council to act in this regard, as this is a matter of national sovereignty, which in many Member States is regulated by the Constitution.  Concerning the facilitation of the exercise of the right to vote, I want to emphasise that in July, the Council adopted a revision of the 1976 electoral law act, encouraging the Member States inter alia to take the measures necessary to allow citizens residing in third countries to vote in elections to the European Parliament. This has been without any doubt an important move towards a more participative European election process.  Regarding the upcoming elections to the European Parliament, the Council supports the EU—wide information and awareness raising campaign on EU citizenship rights, including electoral rights to support turnout. In particular, last year the Council adopted conclusions where it invited Member States to enhance citizens’ participation in the EU democratic process, for example, by better informing them of their rights to vote in local and European elections and by removing barriers to their participation.  In the discussion held last year in the Council on the EU citizenship report 2017, the Council asked the Commission to promote best practices implemented in the Member States to help citizens vote or stand in EU elections. The Council also considered as a positive measure the developments by the Commission of a multilingual standard form to facilitate the swift exchange of information between Member States to its contact points about the rights of citizens to stand as a candidate when residing in another Member State.

In my answer I will summarise what the Commission has done up to now on this issue.  Already in the 2013 citizenship report, the Commission underlined that full participation of Union citizens in the democratic life of the Union at all levels is the very essence of Union citizenship. The right to vote is also clearly at the base of democracy. While most Member States allow their citizens to vote in national elections and referenda in their home countries, a few, enumerated by Madam Wikström today, set considerable restrictions on this right when citizens move to another EU Member State. Since no EU country currently awards foreign nationals the right to vote in national elections and referenda, it means that some EU citizens cannot vote in such elections in any of the EU Member States. The Commission recognises that Member States are solely competent to determine who can benefit from the right to vote in national elections. The EU Treaties only guarantee EU citizens the right to vote in their state of residence in municipal and European elections. However, the founding premise of Union citizenship is that it is additional to national citizenship and is meant to give additional rights. The fact that the exercise of the right to free movement may lead to losing the right of political participation is at odds with that principle.  The Commission has kept the situation under observation for a number of years and the Commission therefore issued a recommendation in 2014, in which Member States were asked that their nationals might apply to remain registered on the electoral roll and therefore retain their right to vote. In last year’s 2017 a report on EU citizenship the Commission referred to this issue of disinfringement in national elections. It noted that 67% of respondents to the 2015 Eurobarometer on EU citizenship felt it was unjustified that citizens should lose their right to vote in national elections in their country of origin.  In April this year the Commission included this issue in the discussion paper transmitted to Member States ahead of an exchange between national election authorities organised following the Commission recommendation of February 2018 on the efficient conduct of the European elections.  Let me assure you that the Commission continues to monitor developments and initiate specific actions within its competence. The annual fundamental rights colloquium to be held on 26 and 27 November this year in Brussels is dedicated to this issue and the title of this year’s colloquium is ‘democracy in the European Union’. You are warmly welcomed to this event. The colloquium will include a session focused on the exercise of the right to vote when moving to another Member State. I am convinced that if we work together we can induce improvements. With regard to the question on the complaints received by the Commission, I would like to inform you that we analysed the ten complaints received in the past five years, but had to conclude that it was not possible to take further action, notably because of lack of competence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 386, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, the right to vote is fundamentally linked to the rule of law and the exercise of political rights, as well as to the free movement of Citizens of the European Union. I am surprised that in the 21st century, some Member States deny the right to vote in national elections to citizens living abroad. After all, the right to vote is one of the fundamental civil rights, and citizens of the same state should be equal in their rights. In some situations, if the state unjustifiably denies citizens the right to vote, it effectively creates secondary citizenship. Is a citizen guilty of working, studying or staying in another country? This does not mean that he does not care about the fate of his country and that he should not have the right to comment on his affairs. Member States should therefore pay more attention to the Commission's 2014 recommendation and allow at least those citizens living abroad who so request to participate in national elections. However, in the institutions of the European Union, we should deal mainly with European elections. I find it unfortunate that some Member States – and the Czech Republic are among them – do not allow their citizens living abroad to vote for their national candidates in European elections. I strongly support the current bill that has been submitted in the Czech Republic for the introduction of a correspondence vote. In european elections, this law would allow Czech citizens to vote for Czech candidates from abroad for the first time. I consider this fair in terms of equal treatment of citizens living abroad. And I believe it would increase turnout. Following this new possibility, there will, of course, also be the need to avoid the double application of the right to vote. However, I believe that good cooperation and exchange of experience with other Member States will help us in this, as will the recently approved amendment to the Electoral Code.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 387, "date": "2018-10-02.json", "name": "Jude KIRTON-DARLING", "mepid": "124953", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, EU citizenship is fundamental for our millions of citizens. It is a shared identity in addition to our national or regional identities which unlocks the possibilities of exploring this great continent, allowing free movement and the opportunity to live, work and study in other EU countries. Political rights as basic as the right to vote or stand as a candidate sit at the very heart of our shared European values.  Since the EU referendum, we Brits are perhaps more aware than most of the value of EU citizenship, since we fear we will lose it. However, while we might share equal treatment protection in the workplace and in access to university places, we do not have equal treatment in that most fundamental bedrock of our societies: the right to democratic participation. Citizens who have taken advantage of the freedom of movement from five Member States, notably my own, often find themselves completely disenfranchised of national representation. They are unable to vote in national elections, both in their home country and in their adopted country.  While I have sympathy for those who argue the logic that citizens who live in another Member State may not be affected by domestic laws or taxes made in their home country, this complete lack of national voting rights for EU citizens who have moved using EU treaty rights is incompatible with our European values.  Moreover, today we have a further complication – in fact, we have lots of complications in relation to Brexit – as we will see EU citizens, either UK nationals in the rest of the EU or EU citizens in the UK, disenfranchised on purpose. These EU citizens, whether Brits abroad for longer than 15 years or EU nationals from our sister countries in the UK, are the most acutely affected by Brexit. Yet they had no say in 2016, and now their democratic rights are being disregarded again as there are no provisions in the draft withdrawal agreement on voting rights, no guarantee of existing rights and no provision for future rights. This is a moral dereliction of duty. What are you doing in the Commission and the Council to avoid this intentional disenfranchisement?

Mr President, the initiative of the Committee on Petitions to bring about the deprivation of electoral rights at European Union level, I think, is very important. And initiatives of this kind must be taken frequently, as we move towards the European elections, because there must be full safeguarding and exercise of electoral rights during the European elections, which come in a very short period of time.  There should be full safeguarding and exercise of electoral rights for those who have left their home Member States. And this applies to over 400,000 Greek citizens who left Greece because of the crisis, who must be able to exercise their electoral rights. And as long as it is in the European Union, this, at least from Greece's point of view, is possible. In other words, they have the possibility to vote by a Greek ballot paper, even if they are, for example, in France.  However, this possibility should, in our view, also be given to those Greek citizens who are registered to vote and reside in third countries, mainly in the United States, Australia and Canada. This is the Greek homogeneity which, if registered on the Greek electoral roll, should be able to exercise this right in the European elections, either by letter vote or at the consulates and embassies of Greece in these countries. Only in this way can there be a full exercise of electoral rights.

The techniques used, seen in other countries as well, include begging voting, unrefiable deadlines, complex consular procedures, paying the voting costs themselves, loss of voting documentation, lack of staff in consulates, etc. Voting has become an ordeal for more than two and a half million people living outside Spain.

The rules in the UK are clear: a person cannot vote in a UK election if they are not on the electoral roll. This is a means by which we can ensure only people entitled to vote can do so.

Now, as a naive contemporary, it is believed that the Member States are trying to ensure that their citizens retain this right for a long time.

We cannot accept that the right to vote in the European Union is de facto dependent on the place of birth.

The right to vote is a fundamental right, and it is the fundamental right that itself protects democracy, because at the end of the day, it is democracy that protects the individual from the excesses of the state. That can only be protected by participation. However, instead of making it easier for people to vote now, we seem to be making it more difficult, either by rigging the register or making it more difficult for people to turn out to vote on the day.  It is vital that we give people who move the right to vote, because it’s people who move in search of work, to discover, to learn, to export, to trade or to create wealth who are the people to whom we need to give a stake in the communities in which they choose to live. Those who have chosen to live in the European continent have been betrayed by the British Government in that referendum and betrayed in the withdrawal agreement. We are now seeing Brexit for what it is, namely the wholesale removal of rights from individuals by the state. They should get the right to reconsider the outcome.

As an elected Member from the United Kingdom, I’m appalled at my national government’s disregard for British citizens’ freedom to exercise conjointly the right to vote and the right to move freely in other European countries. Another very urgent issue concerns the rights of UK citizens who, despite having lived in European countries for many years, may not be able to take part in the local political life of their host country. This is also a concern for European citizens living in the UK. These voting rights are not merely abstract ideas, they have a concrete effect on national and European politics – one of them being the gerrymandered results of the 2016 British referendum.

However, during both the marriage and abortion referendums, the ‘Get the Boat to Vote’ campaign demonstrated that thousands of Irish people abroad are deeply concerned about the future of their country and, if the property market would allow it, they would one day return. Last year our government made the tokenistic proposal to extend voting rights in the election of the president, a largely ceremonial role with no executive powers. Why not enact meaningful reform and allow every Irish citizen a say in how the country is actually run? The answer, of course, is that these disenfranchised voters are also disenchanted voters, and cannot be counted on for their support. By consistently refusing to act and privileging those voters who didn’t have to resort to migration, Ireland is effectively gerrymandering the country and blocking those most affected by the catastrophic decisions of successive Irish governments.
