We know that the continental manufacturing sector suffered a sharp drop in productivity during the crisis years and the employment rate dropped. Entire regions of our Europe have been deindustrialized and have gone into crisis. Only recently has there been a recovery in the share of the industrial sector in relation to European GDP. But today industry is at the crossroads, between innovation and loss of competitiveness, and the European Union must do its part, it must relaunch its own specific industrial policy. This is the meaning and purpose of the question. We call for a more specific and bolder European industrial policy, with a coherent and holistic action plan that goes precisely in the direction it is taking but which needs further impetus to support the competitiveness of our businesses, with active support from the Commission and also of the Member States, on the basis of some priority axes. The first is innovation. The industrial revolution is investing, supporting and shaking the entire industrial sector. Industry 4.0 is an indispensable step, especially for SMEs, for small production companies that cannot make it on their own. So you have to work side by side with companies. Smart manufacturing is the strong theme of this policy. Research clearly shows that companies with high and advanced digital manufacturing also have a higher productivity and revenue premium. So there is a very close link between smart manufacturing and the production capacity of companies. The EU must also foster convergence between different national systems. We cannot have a Europe with 27 industries 4.0. We need a convergence framework, a community framework, because today there is too great a diversity of performance in this field. There is a country that is front runner and the others that struggle, but this divergence is not good for the whole European economy. The European economy needs greater convergence, therefore to ensure that a more advanced smart manufacturing capacity is born in all states. But digital innovation is not just technological innovation, it is a change in business models, it is a change in the world of work. Therefore industrial policy must also go hand in hand with a training policy, preparing the necessary digital skills. The second point is investments. We have many tools that have been put in place. But I think there is a need, first of all, to strengthen those who have given more success, more results, and then to make them more complementary. I am thinking of the structural funds, I am thinking of Horizon. The industrial pillar of Horizon - I say this to the Commissioner because she is certainly sensitive to this - must also be managed more by industry, stronger also in terms of dedicated resources, because it has shown that it works well. And then I also think about the Juncker Plan. If the new Juncker Plan is to make significant investments for the transformation of European industry and the European economy, it must give much more to small and medium-sized enterprises and their capacity for innovation. Finally, internationalization. Here it is not enough to support export stimuli, it is necessary to support the strengthening of companies to position themselves within the global value chain, which is now European and international. We need a more balanced trade policy in the sense also of opening up, of having an open economy, but attentive to reciprocity and mutual benefits, also knowing how to defend - we tell the Commissioner which deals with international trade - with more defensive capacity than our industry, especially where there are countries that have a very strong production overcapacity.I don't have time to deal with the issue of the green economy and the digital economy.Let me just close by saying that there is time and need for a new European Research Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-06-15.json", "name": "Françoise GROSSETÊTE", "mepid": "2025", "text": "author. - Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the manufacturing industry represents today only 13% of the GDP in Europe, that is to say twice less than in 1980. This means that we are living in a deep crisis of competitiveness. Many jobs have been threatened, they are still under threat because we failed to anticipate the industrial revolution. For a long time, we forgot about our industry. As a result, we must now lean on his bedside, because our companies have been hit hard by international competition and the loss of their competitiveness. The renewal of European industry is a priority, as our industry makes a significant contribution to research and development. Without industry, there is no innovation and there is no growth. Certain regions of Europe, formerly industrial, saw the birth of their first technological hub and are becoming regions where start-ups rub shoulders with universities. This new lease of life is the hope for redevelopment of employment and new attractiveness for investors. But we need a truly integrated industrial policy. We need to bring out European champions who export abroad. European competition policy must not hinder the creation of these champions. We cannot treat industrial policy with a narrow view. It is therefore essential to give meaning to each of the tools that we use. I won't go into them in detail, my colleague, Ms. Toia, spoke about them. Finally, our industry needs visibility and stability, fiscal and legal, in order to be able to carry out long-term investments. To do this, we must also train our young generations in the professions of tomorrow, in particular in the digital sector.

The recent Commission reflection paper on harnessing globalisation likewise underlined the need for a strong industrial base in Europe. Some facts, very briefly: European industry provides 50 million direct jobs, equivalent to 20% of our European workforce. Europe is the global leader in many industrial sectors which supply high-value jobs, such as engineering, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, aeronautics and automotives, and European companies play a leading role in markets for future technologies. The Commission, as you know, has taken a novel approach from the outset  to supporting industrial competitiveness and transformation of the EU economy. In every single initiative that we take, we consider the impact on our industry and on jobs.  What have we done so far? For a start, we have been investing in innovation, and, of course, I mean here the opportunities being created by the investment plan and the Horizon 2020 programme. What, I think, is even more important is that direct investment for innovation is improving the climate for private investors. Then there was, for instance, our work last month on the European venture capital funds, added to which are the revamped tax and regulatory environment, the initiatives – over 200 – for further reduction and simplification under the regulatory fitness programme, and, of course, all of the measures under the single market strategy that we are working on.  We are also focusing on skills. Last year we took a radically new approach in our new Skills Agenda for Europe. In this way, for the first time really, as industry is very well placed in our new Skills Agenda, skills have come to the centre of the industrial policy agenda. In addition, we are focusing our policies on new technologies and new approaches. Let me just mention the Circular Economy Package, in which we are now providing very practical ways for industry to turn recycling of resources into strong real business opportunities.  Similarly, we are very clear about the fact that the future is digital. We are deploying all means across the policy agenda. We work from financing research to facilitating standard setting. For example, we want to ensure that our industries make a successful transition to this new digital age and we will soon be reviewing our policy on key enabling technologies. I think that this point should also be stressed because the policy dates from 2008 and a lot has changed since then – 3D printing and autonomous cars were unknown at that stage, so it is high time for a review.  Finally, we are providing sector-specific solutions when needed, from cars to steel, from space to defence. So I personally think, and I know that you know this, that we are now ready and very well prepared, as Ms Toia said, for a coherent ‘holistic European industrial strategy’.  This Commission is 100% committed to fostering a strong industrial base in Europe to face both the challenges of globalisation and, of course, the fourth industrial revolution. Our approach is result oriented. We need to take concrete actions to modernise the economy at the EU’s different levels – EU, national and regional. And we will coordinate national industrial strategies, in particular those related to digitalisation. One way of doing so is to continue the dialogue with industry and with the Member States, so on the last day of February I inaugurated the first European Industry Day, an event at which we all agreed to explore the priority areas, in other words people, territory and technologies.  Let me just refer briefly to each of them. As regards people, given the major transformation in the EU economy, we really need massive upskilling and reskilling of our workforce to avoid widening social gaps. Regarding territory, industrial transformation really happens at regional and local level, so we need to empower regions and to respond to the challenges that we are facing and, of course, make the best of the opportunities. And as far as technologies are concerned, more needs to be done to accelerate the spread of technology in order to close the productivity gap. That is the major issue here. The recent Commission reflection paper on harnessing globalisation picked out exactly the same three areas and points for Europe’s response to globalisation.  In its most recent discussion, last month, the Competitiveness Council   adopted conclusions on industry and for the first time in many years showed that there is wide agreement among Member States on the importance of industry and the need for a European industrial strategy. Not a single country was against this, so that was really a very strong signal from the Member States as well. As they say, we are all friends of industry now. The European Commission is the force for strengthening industrial competitiveness. Our efforts have to be bolstered by the Member States. And we also need Parliament’s support to put in place a legislative framework to facilitate industrial modernisation. We need to have an open debate on how Europe, working together, could do more for European industry. Finally, I also want to underline that when measuring our results, the results of our policies and activities, we could look far beyond the 20% target for manufacturing in our economy.  So once again, I would like to thank Parliament for today’s discussion. I am quite convinced that we need a common vision for the future of European industry, and your contribution and support are vital to that end.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-06-15.json", "name": "Massimiliano SALINI", "mepid": "125670", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, in a minute and a half I do not want to recall once again the numerical value of European industry. We will all talk during this discussion of important numbers, of small and medium-sized enterprises, of large companies and so on. I will emphasize only one thing: the support we decided to give a few years ago, reiterating it, clearly, starting with the Commission, starting with what was said by his predecessor, who is today the President of the European Parliament, Antonio Tajani. We have set ourselves the goal of reaching 20% ​​of the gross domestic product deriving from industry, but this has remained theoretical. Today we are in 2017 and we are at 15%. So let's be honest. If we give ourselves binding targets, which are very right, for example in the context of environmental protection policies in relation to the great emergency of climate change, but we do not give ourselves binding targets on the industrial sector, we do damage both to climate policies and to industry, because it means that, if those are binding and these are not as objectives, it means that those are not intended to protect the environment, but to modify and weaken the industry. So, since we as Europeans support a model of economic development in which man is the protagonist and counts more than a mushroom, because it generates value and also generates capacity for climate protection, we make industrial objectives as binding as those, and this will be an act. of great sincerity and honesty, industrial and cultural.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2017-06-15.json", "name": "Martina WERNER", "mepid": "124826", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Group. - Madam President, Commissioner, colleagues! Up until now, I have always had the feeling that we have always talked past each other in our dialogue with the European Commission. For me, industrial policy is not about listing everything that directly or indirectly influences industrial development. Instead, an EU industrial strategy should define goals and name measures how they can be achieved. The Commission's mainstream approach is reaching its limits at a time when challenges are putting the stability of European industry to the test. These are the enormous international competitive pressure and digitization. When we talk about industrial policy, however, we also have to keep two dimensions in mind - the external and the internal. In the first case, we need to dovetail industrial policy much more closely with trade policy. The Americans benefit from the exchange with the EU - Trump will understand that at some point - and the Chinese are still dependent on foreign know-how. We should use these levers. We have to take the Chinese rhetoric of free trade at its word and push for reciprocal market access and the protection of intellectual property. When we look at Europe, it is particularly important to me that competition, environmental, social and trade policies are more closely intertwined. A stronger interlinking of political areas also means that we have to pay much more attention to social acceptance, and that can only be achieved in a dialogue with trade unions and employers. In Germany, for example, the Future of Industry Alliance is working successfully, and I am sure that there are similar forums in other Member States. An industrial strategy can emerge from a European dialogue that sensibly combines cross-industry and sectoral elements. you must find answers to questions: How do we keep value creation and know-how in Europe, and which future fields are actually decisive?And only then does it make sense to adapt the legal framework or, for example, define the priorities for research and infrastructure funding after 2020.So now is the right time to reflect on industrial policy and for the Commission to finally come up with a proposal on it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-06-15.json", "name": "Evžen TOŠENOVSKÝ", "mepid": "96713", "text": "for the ECR Group. - Madam President, in a globalized world, it is very important to keep our industry competitive.

Let's see, finally, finally it seems that an industrial policy for Europe is being taken seriously. But, having said that, I must say with all due respect that I was a little disappointed by the position of the Commissioner. Again, we talk about innovation again. It's very good. Of course, who is not going to go for innovation? And, above all, linked to the environment. It's very good. Once again, we speak again, in the solutions, of the circular economy, which, of course, the ALDE Group supports, and so on. No, you see, that is still throwing balls out.

An ambitious industrial policy must necessarily be based on four aspects: public intervention, territorial cohesion, social rights and a new framework for global trade. Without regulation, the industry becomes the hostage of finance and rentiers, like the electricity oligopoly, pending only its benefits and not the productive development of the country. Therefore, the objective of 20% of industrial GDP cannot be achieved if these sectors are not put at the service of the general interest. Our organization advocates the nationalization of energy and banking, but even in the current framework we need reforms to lower industrial costs. Let's think about bilateral contracts between generators and industry or within industrial estates, possibilities very little exploited, for example, with governments of countries like Spain. We also need to fight against asymmetries within the European Union: while some countries accumulate trade surpluses, others have anemic industry, which prevents us from developing a productive model and condemns us to unemployment and precariousness. Only a true investment plan targeting less industrialized regions will ensure that they develop in the long term. Let's also talk about labor rights: industrial relocations, outsourcing and subcontracting are multiplying to weaken the labor movement. If we want a strong industry, we have to adapt the legislation to strengthen collective bargaining. If Europe wants to lead the industrial transition, it has to do so from productivity and not from precariousness. Finally, we need another view of global trade.

I am very happy about this discussion and would like to expressly thank the colleagues who initiated this. Ms. Bieńkowska, if you have listened carefully, there is one lesson you should learn from this discussion: stop patting yourself on the back as if you were doing everything right! At a time when a revolution is on the way, you have to show great design ambition if you don't want to end up in a dead end. I do not see this design ambition in you yet. I see six principles necessary for this industrial policy initiative at issue here. First: we need a European strategy, not just an agglomeration of national strategies. Second: innovation must be at the center. Everyone here says that. Thirdly: we need a cross-cutting policy instead of adding columnar attempts. Fourth, we need inclusivity, and inclusivity applies both to the workers that Mrs Werner spoke of and to the regions on which we are not allowed to depend. Fifth, we need a holistic approach, as Mrs Toia said. In my opinion, a holistic approach also means that we have to combine competitiveness and sustainability; this Parliament has already decided that.

I have an idea that to all of you might seem strange and against all precedent, but will, I think, work. Do nothing. In fact, stop what you are doing now. Roll it back. Let our nation-states do what they think is best for their peoples. Every nation is different, every nation has different strengths, circumstances and psyches. Your overarching one-size-fits-all strategies simply do not work and will only cause more hardship across our continent. Stop trying to harmonise everything. All your big plans do is give influence to the tens of thousands of lobbyists and their paymasters in tax-eating mega businesses and NGOs which infest your corridors of power and restrict innovation.  Let nations set their own tax rates. Let them do what they think best. Let national governments and their peoples again have the freedom they need to innovate and to create employment. This incessant desire to do something is actually a drag on innovation and employment. Do not follow the five-year plan mentality of social cooperative-style ideology. You cannot legislate yourselves into prosperity. Step back. Stop piling administrative burdens onto businesses and governments and let people work in their own enlightened economic self-interest. Innovation happens only when people have the freedom to innovate. Forcing people into your perception of what they should do is not only morally wrong: it is counterproductive. Resist the prescriptive urge. That is the only path to prosperity.  This constant desire to do something, anything, merely brings into existence a boa constrictor that chokes life and spirit from free peoples. Resist it. Let small businesses breathe.

The industrial share in the world is falling, the European share is decreasing. So something has to be done. Therefore, everything cannot have been right. And now there is an argument about what is right. Some say: another dialogue, another conversation; some have even said: more laws; others said: more money. I think this is all wrong. I believe - some colleagues have also said this here - that industry in Europe has a chance if we help where we can, but also give industry the opportunity to let itself develop. The key is innovation - of course! What do we do at Horizon? We cut. Great, great contribution. Implementing structural reforms in the countries: The member states are responsible for this. Wherever Member States are not making good progress, we help, we apply pressure - half-heartedly. Half-heartedly - the Commission does not always take the opportunities that are available.

I also agree that it is quite difficult, much more difficult, to use existing instruments if we do not have such a common approach, but definitely those two and a half years were not wasted. We are prepared quite well, but we need the support of everyone and every actor to have and to start the work on such a strategy.

First, appropriate regulation should help increase R&D spending in a technology-neutral way. Second, we need to give all the help we need to the industry so that they can sell their products at a competitive price in the global market as well. For energy-intensive industries, the level of energy prices is crucial. With the creation of the single energy market, we have started to reduce energy prices. However, there are still some pending energy policy issues that could negatively affect market development. An excellent example of this is the authorization of the expansion of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which could contribute to rising energy prices in some Member States.

But let us be very clear that to breach the sovereignty of other countries to abduct, beat up and imprison journalists and critics of the government is completely unacceptable. We utterly condemn what has happened to Mr Mukhtarli and call on the Georgian Government to ensure a prompt investigation. We call on the Azerbaijani Government to immediately drop all the bogus charges against Afgan Mukhtarli and release him from prison and, with him, let all the political prisoners go.

The dialogue - regardless of the level at which it is conducted - is a thousand times better than an essentially speechless confrontation. A few days ago in the southern Caucasus I was able to observe for myself how complex the social transformation processes are in the region, how great is the need for joint social learning processes and meeting processes. The human rights demands of our resolution are clearly placed here. Äfqan Muxtarlı is to be released immediately, and the charges against him are to be overturned, because in the end nowhere can justice be pronounced which is based on a fundamental injustice. The obvious kidnapping of someone who has fled persecution and his transfer to the country he fled from is wrong. Our demand also applies: the country that pretended to be a safe place of escape must prove without contradiction that it has nothing to do with the kidnapping. Azerbaijan has developed inconsistently in terms of human rights. We learn again from this that our demands can only be implemented sustainably if something changes in the systems of exercise of power. The criminalization of criticism and critics will go on and on if it is not ultimately made a criminal offense and prosecution itself.

It happened to investigative journalist Afgan Mukhtarli, who was arrested 2 weeks ago under false pretenses and now has the prospect of a long-term politically motivated trial in Azerbaijan. The situation is part of a series of worrying developments, with the Baku government silencing critics, from fabricated crimes to oppressive legislation and bureaucratic rules for civil society organizations. The result? Today, more than 100 political prisoners are held without the prospect of anything resembling a fair trial. But the repression has now entered a new phase. Political refugees in neighboring countries are apparently no longer safe either. According to Mukhtarli, his captors spoke Georgian. This raises serious questions about the possible involvement of the Georgian security services. Therefore, this must also be researched to the bottom. It means that hundreds of Azerbaijanis living in exile in Georgia suddenly have to worry about their safety. Let me say the last words in English so that we can have the debate here in the Parliament. There is this proposal to postpone, for the first time, a vote on a matter of urgency.

We have taken careful note of the arrest and sentencing of the number of persons who have criticised the authorities, as well as systemic measures to curb freedom of expression, such as a decision to permanently block five online media outlets or increase criminal penalties for insulting the President.  The number of government critics behind bars has increased rapidly since last summer. The charges are not always related to the exercise of freedom of expression, but range, of course, from drug-related charges to liberal and financial irregularities. What these cases have in common is the ease with which the arguments of the defence have been dismissed. On 30 May, the EU reacted immediately to the apparent abduction of a journalist in another country in order to imprison him in Azerbaijan, recalling that civil rights and due process of law must be respected.  These developments ran counter to the broader renewal of recent positive engagement between the EU and Azerbaijan following a number of positive developments since 2015, including the release of several high-profile human rights defenders, activists and journalists. Positive interparliamentary cooperation has also resumed and the visit by the Committee on Foreign Affairs to Azerbaijan in May was welcomed as a part of this renewed engagement. We will step up our diplomatic effort to return to this path. In a statement on 4 June, the spokesperson for the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy/Vice-President of the Commission called for an immediate review of the case and the release of all individuals detained as a result of exercising their fundamental freedoms. The issue will also be raised by Commissioner Hahn, as you noticed, who will be visiting Baku as of tomorrow, including with President Aliyev. The EEAS has also raised this point in a meeting with their counterparts. Our main tool for steering our relationship with Azerbaijan is, of course, the new agreement that is currently being negotiated.

Of 50 Muslim-majority countries around the world, only 13 – including Pakistan – have a death penalty for blasphemy. Islam is a religion of peace, not of death. We welcome the Pakistani Government’s decision to adopt the Human Rights Action Plan; we call on them to repeal capital punishment for blasphemy and immediately release all prisoners held under these charges. Only a country that allows people to speak out freely can truly be called righteous.

Among other things, this plan includes the execution of death sentences for those accused of terrorism. Unfortunately, we have seen how, within the umbrella of the accusation of terrorism, the Government of Pakistan is including all kinds of cases, especially to persecute the political and social opposition. Especially significant is the case of the activist Baba Jan and twelve other peaceful protesters, sentenced to life imprisonment in 2014 by the Anti-Terrorism Tribunal. From here we send you a big greeting and hug. This situation is a clear step back from the 2008 moratorium, which partially eased the execution of civilians. But since the beginning of 2015 this moratorium has completely ended for all those sentenced for capital crimes. From here we want to demand not only fair and fair trials and freedom for political activists unjustly imprisoned in Pakistan like Baba Jan, but we want to raise our voice for the global abolition of the death penalty. In our opinion, this situation shows, once again, the shame of a European Union and, in particular, of the Commission, which allows Pakistan to be one of the eight countries that benefit from the Generalized System of Preferences - the GSP -, for which is obtained preferential rates in exchange for the commitment to respect human rights, which Pakistan does not respect. To this day, the monitoring system and the SPG itself are clearly in question, once again. Surely, this system has contributed a lot to boost many businesses. We know, for example, that many European companies import manufactured textile products from Pakistan and surely benefit from this framework.

This is the reason why we aim at deepening our partnership with Pakistan through a strategic engagement plan which is currently under preparation. Still, despite some progress made in the GSP+ process, the gap between the institutional human rights framework and the situation on the ground in Pakistan continues to be significant.  In all its contacts with Pakistan the EU continues to stress the importance of reintroducing the moratorium on executions. The number of executions has been reduced in the second half of 2016 and the first half of this year. We hope that this trend will lead to a definitive stop of executions and hope that this will set a direction towards finally abolishing the death penalty and towards the full respect of all international human rights obligations by Pakistan.  Yet, the extension of the military courts for another two years really constitutes a worrying element and the EU has been repeatedly calling for a comprehensive judicial reform. We are equally very concerned about the situation of human rights defenders in Pakistan. Apart from pressure and intimidation by the authorities, human rights defenders are also subject to threats, violence and even murder by extremist militant groups, and an even more worrisome trend is that allegations of blasphemy are being used to silence human rights defenders.  Yet Pakistan has established a national commission for human rights. It has adopted a human rights action plan and introduced legislation for the protection of women and children. However, there are big differences among the provinces of Pakistan as well as strong resistance against any change from religious political parties. The EU is supporting several projects to improve human rights awareness and protection in Pakistan with a total amount of EUR 97 million.

The death penalty is increasingly used in the fight against drug trafficking, including against foreigners. The case of the French Serge Atlaoui is an example.

We value our close partnership with this country. The EU has always had the highest regard for Indonesia’s tradition as a pluralist, diverse and tolerant society but we acknowledge incidents that might call this tradition into question now. Members of this House have raised a number of human rights issues in Indonesia, including the situation of the LGBTI community, media freedom, the application of the blasphemy law, the rights of the minorities, women’s rights and Christians’ rights. The EU has established a constructive and cooperative engagement on human rights in the form of a regular human rights dialogue with Indonesia, which allows for an exchange also on very sensitive subjects. We had the sixth Human Rights Dialogue last June and we are planning for the next meeting later in this year. We also use other available opportunities to discuss human rights issues, through traditional diplomatic tools. The EU has encouraged Indonesia to abide by its international human rights commitments under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and to ensure that national and regional laws, both in their formulation and implementation, do not discriminate against any of its citizens. In regard to LGBTI persons, we welcome the statement by President Joko Widodo last October, when he said the police must act, that there should be no discrimination against anyone and that protection should be ensured.  The right to freedom of religion or belief is guaranteed in Indonesia’s constitution. The European Union has consistently stated that laws that criminalise blasphemy can, when applied in a discriminatory manner, have a serious inhibiting effect on freedom of expression and on freedom of religion or belief. We note that the Constitutional Court reviewed the blasphemy law in 2010 but found it not to be in violation of the constitution. We note renewed debate about the law in Indonesia, where the EU has made its voice very hard. Let me add that several projects are funded under the European Initiative on Democracy and Human Rights, on freedom of religion and belief and protection of minority groups.

Some of the colleagues have proposed postponement for one reason, and that is that Commissioner Hahn will have an opportunity, travelling to Baku, to raise the issue – or he has already travelled – but the point is, we have considered this an urgency and all political groups have agreed. Everyone knows, including the person detained, as well as the Azerbaijani Government, that we are discussing and eventually postponing it on the request of Mr Hahn, for the reason that he would like to be in a better position. That is not correct. My assessment is different. If we postpone it, that basically means that we accept the disrespect of President Aliyev in that a few days before the abduction he received for an hour and a half an EP high ranking delegation discussing human rights, and then this is done. I do not believe that that will achieve the goal.  A final remark – what will achieve the goal is if the Commissioner has in hand a well—balanced wording of a resolution that will help to strengthen his position in order to release the gentleman.

Now the competition is going on: which comes first? The positive result of cohesion and investment policies for the Latvian economy or huge demographic change in Latvia.  Many people have left the country because they are tired of waiting for the Latvian economy to reach western and Nordic EU economy levels. They prefer to emigrate with their families. The shrinking working-age population will not offer any prospects for those who remain in the country. As a result, we will see a beautiful but empty country with a small, old and poor population.

Apart from entailing a lot of work in each successive debate, this is not good for stable democracy in the EU. That is my opinion. The proposal raising the number of MEPs needed to create a European party is unhelpful for the much-needed dialogue between the EU institutions and citizens in the EU. It gives a strong impression that you need to be inside the Brussels bubble in order to become part of it.

The reason for this debate today is International Family Day, and the United Nations has published a handout for it. According to the United Nations, mother and father are the most important point of reference in the lives of children and especially toddlers. Young children are best socialized within the family - within the family rather than outside the family, says the United Nations. And the more fathers and mothers take care of their children, the better things go in their children's lives, say the United Nations. The educational achievements of parents are measurable achievements that are economically and socially relevant and which must therefore be promoted, say the United Nations. In summary, the UN say: The most important thing for children in their lives are father and mother - their parents - and not an all-day kindergarten or external care. You notice that this is the exact opposite of what religion seems to be here in this house. The European Union prefers to sponsor week nurseries like in the Eastern Bloc and in the GDR. Mothers shouldn't take care of their toddlers, but they should realize themselves at the workbench, because only that is true achievement and career. And in the Noichl report we actually decided that marriage - of course only traditional marriage and not gay marriage - and the role of father and mother are dangerous to health. That is probably also the reason why it is not the responsible Commissioner Jourová who is sitting here today, but the Commissioner for Health. Family a health risk. The EU simply does not want to recognize the importance of the family and the role of father and mother, when it is the most important thing in a child's life. But there are Member States that are on the right track. Hungary, for example, recently held a demography summit under the Orbán government. They had previously launched a number of family policies that do just that - promoting fathers and mothers for their children and for early childhood education. So they exist, these Member States, who have taken the right path, and I hope for Germany and also for the European Union, but especially for my country Germany, that we will take this Hungarian path in terms of family policy. And that means that we must move completely away from the path that is being followed here in this House and turn towards the path that the United Nations describe: The most important thing in life for a child is father and mother and families and not the state as higher authority; that is the belief here, that is fundamentally wrong.

Observing the day offers a good opportunity to discuss the role of families and the impact of family-oriented policies in promoting overall well—being in Europe and worldwide, and in the world of work more generally. As you know, Member States are, first and foremost, responsible for social policies addressed to families. Nevertheless, the Commission has been supporting Member States through political guidance in the context of the European Semester. European Union financial support is also available through the European Social Fund, the European Regional Development Fund and the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived. Concerning the roles of families in educating their children, the Commission reiterated in our recent communication on school development and excellent teaching that the cooperation of educational institutions and parents is key. We will continue to use the tools under the Education and Training 2020 Strategy and the Erasmus Plus programme to support Member States who wish to develop school policies that deepen parental involvement. Second question: we share your view on the important role played by families in the welfare of our societies, in particular when it comes to providing care for children and other dependent family members. This is precisely why the European Pillar of Social Rights adopted on 26 April 2017 recognises the role of family members as caregivers and states that parents and people with caring responsibilities have the right to suitable leave, flexible working agreements and access to care services.  As a concrete deliverable of the Pillar, our new initiative on work—life balance for parents and carers aims to modernise the way in which work—life balance policies are designed to improve the daily lives of many parents and carers. In addition to supporting the provisions of formal care services, we intend to update the European Union legal framework in the areas of family—related leave and flexible working arrangements in order to enable working parents and carers to better reconcile their professional and caring responsibilities. In addition, the Pillar includes the right to affordable early childhood education and care of good quality. It also states the right to protection from poverty and the right to specific support measures to enhance equal opportunities for children from disadvantaged backgrounds. Early childhood education and care is precisely such a specific measure which helps to break the cycle of disadvantage. This is why the Commission supports Member States in improving access to, and the quality of, early childhood education and care. We acknowledge that family is the first and most important place for children to grow and develop. At the same time, the Commission sees early childhood education provision and the family’s role in education as complementary. Participating in early education is in the best interests of children and their families. It is in these formative years that we can lay the foundations for a successful life, social integration and employability. The Commission therefore considers that the provision of early childhood education is an indispensable part of an efficient and modern social infrastructure. We are also monitoring the implementation of the 2013 recommendation on investing in children. In the context of the European Semester, the Commission has provided targeted, country—specific recommendations to those Member States with the biggest challenges, and we are supporting the exchange of good practices in the area of child and family policy through the European Platform for Investing in Children and the Erasmus+ programme. The Commission also provides financial support to various NGOs, including Eurocarers, the Confederation of Family Organisations in the EU, Eurochild and the European Network on Independent Living. The actions undertaken by these NGOs substantially contribute to raising awareness of issues related to the work of family members. Third question: we share your concern regarding the invisible or unpaid work of working parents and carers. This is why the Commission put forward this new initiative on work—life balance for working parents and carers. This sets out a comprehensive package of complementary legal and policy measures which will enable both parents to care for their children, thus enhancing their children’s cognitive development and well—being. As regards European Union funds, the funding possibilities for children in the existing EU financial instrument have been significantly strengthened in the current 2014-2020 programming period. Approximately EUR 21.2 billion of the total European Social Fund’s allocation was earmarked for social inclusion measures, of which EUR 3.9 billion is set aside for access to services, including childcare, and EUR 8 billion was earmarked for measures to prevent early school leaving. Moreover, around EUR 11 billion from the European Regional Development Fund is planned for measures promoting social inclusion and combating poverty, while around EUR 6 billion are planned for investment in educational infrastructure.

Among the most endangered are those who live with one parent or even without a stable family background.

I would also like to point out that, unfortunately, many activities are not entirely favorable to the family, which - as we know - is the natural environment for raising a child. The Barcelona cells encourage women to work, despite the fact that, according to research, a significant proportion want to personally look after their baby after its birth. Meanwhile, it is proposed that most children should attend pre-school education. According to Norwegian studies, the level of stress in children in nurseries is as much as 30% higher than in those staying at home. Especially in young children, prolonged stress has a very negative effect on development, especially on the brain. It has been proven that the more time children spend in a nursery, the more anti-social attitudes they show, and teenagers brought up in nurseries after the age of 15 more often use alcohol, cigarettes or drugs. Personally, I am also against introducing special incentives for fathers to raise newborns instead of mothers, because they need a more delicate, caring and sensitive personality to the needs of the newborn. The period of childhood plays a huge role in proper development, when the child unconsciously identifies with its mother until the second year of life. Later, for a female child, the mother remains a model, while for boys, in the third year of life, identification with the father begins. The difference in interests of male and female children is noticeable from the earliest moments of life, which proves that gender differentiation is built into the cognitive process in the womb.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "IND/DEM", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 151, "date": "2017-06-15.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Club. - Madam President, I am very glad that this item is on the agenda of our Parliament today because I want to say very clearly that it is very good to celebrate International Family Day, because the family is certainly one of the foundations of society.

Our labor market and pension systems punish fathers and mothers who choose to raise children. The time they devote to them is a barrier for employers and leads to lower wages and pensions. Being a parent is not worth it. The solution is not individualization of policies, but family mainstreaming. Every policy has an impact on the family, and this needs to be quantified in advance.

There are loopholes through which, through national legislation, there is an excess of zeal in taking children from their parents, for one reason or another. We have the case of that doctor from Finland, where the two children, right now when we are talking, are separated from their mother, the mother being a doctor and being able to take care of them.

There is subsidiarity, but I think we can intervene so that, on the one hand, there are no excesses in the adoption of children from the family and their institutionalization and, on the other hand, we see how we invest in education, in order to increase families' incomes, in order to be recognized, for example, in retirement, maternity leave should be in a larger amount, so that we can motivate, because we are not well with the demographics.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 157, "date": "2017-06-15.json", "name": "Tibor SZANYI", "mepid": "124703", "text": "- Ms. President!

This can address issues with work and life at home and what you mentioned about private and other things.  This is an agenda which needs to fully engage all stakeholders, in particular Member States. Of course, it must be in line with the subsidiarity principle, because we have no chance to intervene in the Member States’ area of responsibility: absolutely, it is crystal clear. We must also look at the situation of proportionality.

I would also like to set up the discussion in such a way that it concerns health and also the family, which is important to all of us. For example, we could have been the parents of an Italian girl from Naples, Tiziana, who killed herself a year ago because the videos of her sexual relations had ended up on the net, on Facebook, for a revenge from her ex-boyfriend and had become viral. The girl could no longer leave the house, she was the victim of persecution, harassment, a kind of collective rape, until she hanged herself. For many months the videos of the dead girl continued to circulate on Facebook, in a macabre rise in audience, until an Italian court ruling blocked them. But Facebook's lawyers in Ireland, who look after Facebook's interests in Italy in order not to pay taxes in Italy, have obtained that the company in any case does not suffer any sanctions and have appealed to European legislation for this. I don't know if this seems justice to you, it doesn't seem to me. We have an e-commerce directive which excludes online platforms from editorial responsibility. A directive that is seventeen years old, when e-commerce did not exist, platforms were just born and were really a pure vehicle for sharing content and information, and in addition the technologies did not allow ex ante control of the contents entered. Network. Today the world has changed, you all know that. E-commerce is the largest growing business on the planet, platforms are global players, economic giants that devour entire production sectors, concentrate quantities of resources and power, threaten media pluralism. Fortunately, however, the advances in science allow us today, with increasingly sophisticated algorithms, to control i contents on the net in a very short time. Despite this, Facebook and Google, which are able to destroy a person's reputation in an hour or influence the outcome of an election campaign by hosting fake news campaigns, continue to be less responsible than a small local broadcaster, a small provincial newspaper, which for a cause may risk closure. But the most serious trait concerns us as parents, because the weakest element of this unfair and sick market is only minors, children, who are exposed to a bombardment of deceptive advertisements through deceptive product placement advertisements, they are exposed to a bombardment of bad habits, such as junk food, and of course they are the victims of other worrying phenomena that are expanding on the net such as hate speech or child pornography. Instead of rhetoric about the family, we try to defend our children from these risks. So the Commission does not think that this unfair market should now finally be regulated with fair and modern criteria, which protect consumers, especially the weakest, especially minors, starting to revise the e-commerce directive as soon as possible. ask many European countries starting with Italy?", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 162, "date": "2017-06-15.json", "name": "Curzio MALTESE", "mepid": "125192", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, the Commission shares broadly the problem analysed and presented by the honourable Member. One of the main objectives of the European Union is to protect vulnerable groups, including minors, consumers and citizens in general through harmonisation of laws. The Commission is fully committed both to safeguarding freedom of expression and protecting vulnerable viewers – children in particular – from harmful content, and all citizens against hate speech. Article 14 of the e-commerce directive needs to be interpreted on a case—by—case basis. While the e-commerce directive prohibits Member States from imposing a general monitoring obligation on providers, it requires providers to act upon obtaining actual knowledge of illegal activity in order to avoid liability.  The Commission believes that progress can be made without reopening the e-commerce directive, which has been a major contributor to innovation and societal benefits. The European Union has proposed targeted measures to ensure that platforms take action against specific problems, such as illegal hate speech and terrorist propaganda.  The Commission has also initiated and strongly supported co-regulatory efforts. The Commission communication on the mid-term review of the Digital Single Market of 10 May 2017 announced a better coordination of dialogues with platforms, focusing on the mechanisms and technical solutions for the removal of illegal content. This communication also announced the Commission’s guidelines on two topics: first, coherent procedural aspects such as the notification and removal of illegal content; second, on liability rules and support to platforms on voluntary measures taken by the platform when they work proactively to remove illegal content, acting in good faith. The Commission is currently reflecting on the most appropriate form for such guidance.  The issue of protection of minors and hate speech on video-sharing platforms is addressed by the proposals of a review of the Audiovisual Media Service Directive adopted on 25 May 2016, which is currently under discussion by the Council and Parliament. The Commission proposal foresees a limited extension of its scope to video-sharing platforms, for example YouTube. The proposed system seeks to keep the balance between the fundamental right of freedom of expression and important public interest objectives, such as the protection of minors against harmful content and the protection of all citizens against hate speech.  According to the proposals, only those rules that are necessary to protect the viewers from the most harmful content will apply to video-sharing platforms. Member States should ensure that video-sharing platforms put in place measures to 1) protect minors from harmful content, access to which would have to be restricted, and 2) protect all citizens from incitement to hate.  The measures consist, where appropriate, in establishing and operating flagging and reporting mechanisms, age verification systems, systems to read the content by the uploaders or users, or parental control systems. It is important to stress that none of the measures included in the proposal entail a general obligation to monitor or ex—ante control; it is fully in line with the e-commerce directive.  Member States are encouraged to implement the new rules via co-regulation. The involvement of the industry will ensure that measures are future-proofed and that platform is built on what they are already doing on a voluntary basis. Some platforms are indeed already making great efforts to protect minors online and citizens from hate speech. Through the implementation via co-regulation, we are aiming to a building on the work already done. However, there are services that do not have such measures in place. Now all video-sharing platforms will be obliged to take measures. The Audiovisual Media Service Directive would provide regulators with a regulatory backstop in case there is no action from platforms. In addition, video-sharing platforms today apply their own standards when it comes to assessing what is harmful for minors or what constitutes hate speech. The Commission proposal aims that they have to comply with the Audiovisual Directive standards in this field.  The Commission believes that the proposed rules will ensure a better protection of viewers in online services. The Commission is also looking forward to the upcoming trialogues, and hopes to secure the adoption of the revised Audiovisual Media Service Directive as soon as possible, as this is a priority file and identified by the institutions.

With varying degrees of severity and content across countries, but across Europe, our common experience is that young generations are re-infected with different manifestations of human hatred and intolerance, the poison of extreme nationalism, racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia. The phenomenon is particularly well known in Eastern and Central Europe, where the dangerous varieties of anti-Semitism are striking, among the youngest, almost childhood populations, which led to the extermination of millions well before their birth and even the birth of their parents, whole peoples, generations. to its priceless suffering and irreparable losses. In researching the reasons for this terrifying trend, we first come across the most unscrupulous representatives of the political extremism, who do not shy away from the mental poisoning of young people, or from tolerating it from a position of power, in order to achieve their obscure political goals. The responsibility of the government and other factors responsible for education cannot be avoided for failing to arm the younger generations enough against the return of the ordeal of our history, and there are even examples of signs of this appearing in the curriculum itself or in official government policy. The latter, unfortunately, is now a global dimension, the cyber war by Putin's Russia and organized falsification of news. And when looking at the tools, today they provide the most obvious, and perhaps the least transparent and verifiable, space for this dangerous phenomenon, to which children and juveniles are most susceptible, including, for the first time, the video-sharing platforms under discussion today. That is why our common thinking today is so important that I think it should be translated into joint and effective EU action in the short term.

I know both the case of Tiziana Cantone - I come from the same region - and the case of the blue whale, which a colleague mentioned earlier. However, in this case, we are talking about crimes and I beg to differ. In the e-commerce directive it does not say that platforms are not responsible. And if we want to say that Article 14, paragraph 3, is not working, I agree and if we are willing to reopen the directive to find a more stringent way to protect European citizens, I agree perfectly. However, on the other hand, these are crimes and we must also think about freedom of expression. Are we really convinced that the simplest solution is to give private individuals a power that belongs to the judicial authority? Often these individuals are big companies, are often or almost always non-Europeans, and have a monopoly status. And so I wonder where the limit begins and where the freedom of expression ends. Another separate discussion concerns advertising. I believe that the latest form of protection for children is truly guaranteed by the abolition of advertising that belongs to them. The clear and precise rules of commercial communications should instead be contained in an ad hoc legislative act, which concerns advertising on all media.
