In recent weeks, we have seen the people of Hong Kong marching in unprecedented numbers, exercising their fundamental rights of freedom of expression and assembly, as guaranteed by the Basic Law. The massive demonstrations over the last weeks have shown the determination of the Hong Kong people to keep the ‘one country, two systems’ principle intact.  I would like to take this opportunity of the debate today to recall that the EU’s full support for the ‘one country, two systems’ principle and its implementation remains very vocal. The principle gives Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and ensures respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong’s people.  This principle is also key for business confidence in Hong Kong. Hong Kong, as you know and as you have already said, is an important financial centre, a global hub for offshore Renminbi (RMB) business and a strategic trans-shipment port. The ‘one country, two systems’ principle is essential for Hong Kong to continue to fully play its strategic economic role. Since the beginning of the movement, the European Union has called for restraint by all sides, underlining that violence and escalatory responses must be avoided. We reject all kinds of violence. We were deeply shocked by the events of 1 July at the Legislative Council building.  The European Union shares many of the concerns raised by citizens of Hong Kong regarding the government’s proposed extradition reforms. This is a very sensitive issue with potentially far-reaching consequences for Hong Kong and its people, for the European Union and foreign citizens, as well as for business confidence in Hong Kong.

They are a grave violation of the Refugee Convention as they deprive migrants of the right to seek asylum and get protection if they are in need of this. The results are painfully visible in the Mexican-US border region, and this resolution therefore urges both countries to live up to their international obligations. Trump’s policy is shamelessly violating international law by separating children from their parents and even detaining them, by detaining many migrants in appalling circumstances and by sending asylum seekers back to Mexican cities. Back in Mexico they struggle to get access to an asylum procedure, and if they manage to lodge an asylum claim, the lengthy procedure is unclear and lacks the normal safeguards. As asylum seekers don’t have access to shelter or other basic needs, they are extremely vulnerable to exploitation and violence. The US Government refuses to take any responsibility and is forcing Mexico to deal with the migrants and refugees. In autumn last year most countries ratified the UN Global Compact on Refugees, in which almost all countries promised to share responsibility for refugees. Pushback actions go totally against this common objective and they also trigger the same policies in other countries. If there’s no common responsibility, no one wants to take it up. The USA did not sign this compact but it still has to comply with its international obligations.

Reno – a case of mistreatment suffered in an CIE by a 15-year-old Salvadoran woman, dating back to 1997 – according to which children cannot be detained in CIEs together with adults awaiting sentencing. The Trump administration, therefore, did not change the rules, they were the same rules even under Democratic governments. Children are being held in other NGO-controlled facilities. In the New York Times, illegal immigrants admitted that they had brought children with them, believing that in this way the US authorities would release them. Others admitted that the children who were with them were not their children. Policies to curb illegal immigration are sacrosanct. Those who build a fence around their home do not do it because they hate those outside, but to protect those inside. President Trump's clarity in the unreserved fight against illegal immigration is certainly preferable to the buonism to which European leaders accustomed us years ago, who claimed, in words, to open their doors and hearts to all immigrants and then dumped the problem on the countries of first reception.

Mr President, we are talking here about the southern border of the United States. We could also talk about europe's southern border. But I don't hear about that at all!

On the U.S. southern border, far fewer people have drowned in the Rio Grande and about 400 people have died. The problem in Europe is therefore much bigger than in the United States, but we condemn the United States! Let's look at our own house first. A migration policy cannot be done without effective borders. Only at effective limits can you tell who can get in, what criteria there are, who doesn't get in, where work needs to be found.

Thousands aim to cross the US-Mexico border in the hope of reaching safety and building a livelihood for themselves, their families and their children. The reasons are manifold and many were noted in the earlier debate of the previous European Parliament on 14 November 2018.  While the situation on the ground requires urgent responses by the relevant authorities, the root causes of the migratory flows that drive many to the US’s southern borders have long been present. Only a persistent, systematic and coordinated joint effort by the countries concerned in the international community may lead to an improvement on the ground. The European Union is concerned by reports about the current situation in the border areas. The separation of families of migrants, the cases of ill—treatment of migrants, and of course the conditions in detention centres, as you have already emphasised.  The European Union continues to stand firmly on the side of human dignity. We reiterate the importance of protecting human rights and respecting international law, while we also recall the right of each country to manage its borders.  The European Union’s policy aims to promote regular and well-managed migration while addressing the root causes of irregular migration, enforced displacement and of course fighting human trafficking and smuggling. As the European Union, we have undertaken a strong effort in supporting the countries in the region, based on the principle of partnership and international cooperation in addressing migratory cooperation and challenges. Our policy builds on a comprehensive approach, which includes, first of all, saving lives, and secondly, ensuring protection and support, as well as legal pathways for those in need of international protection. The European Union’s long-standing cooperation efforts towards the countries of the so-called ‘northern triangle’ – Honduras, Guatemala, El Salvador – are in fact addressing the main drivers of migration. European Union cooperation has been strengthening the rule of law and fighting crime and gang violence, but also violence against women and vulnerable groups such as LGBTI or indigenous people. European Union funds have been provided to address the dire consequences of climate change, in particular in terms of food security, and to promote the creation of jobs, along with the opening of our markets.  In addition, in line with what we commit to do with our Mexican counterparts under the modernised EU-Mexico Association Agreement, we invite the US and Mexico to cooperate on migration issues to foster safe, regular and orderly migration to prevent irregular migration, to counter migrant smuggling and trafficking in persons. We also call for the protection of migrant women and children, particularly those who are unaccompanied, as well as other vulnerable groups.  As the European Union, we stand ready to work together with the countries concerned – the US, Mexico and Central American countries – in addressing this issue. In this respect, we support the El Salvador-Guatemala-Honduras-Mexico Comprehensive Development Plan, as proposed by the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, currently being developed and discussed with partners in the region which, as you know, aims at addressing the root causes of irregular migration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 34, "date": "2019-07-18.json", "name": "Dita CHARANZOVÁ", "mepid": "124708", "text": "  The debate is closed.

The European Union has repeatedly expressed concern at the fate of all Ukrainian citizens illegally detained in the Crimean Peninsula and in Russia. These include Crimean Tatars and others who have opposed the illegal annexation as well as other Ukrainians. We continue to call for the immediate and unconditional release of the captured Ukrainian servicemen and their vessels, as has been ordered by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Diplomats from the EU delegations in our Member States’ embassies in Moscow regularly attend the court hearings and are in constant contact with the lawyers. The European Union also regularly raises individual cases – including those of Oleg Sentsov, Pavlo Hryb and Edem Bekirov, who, as you know, require urgent medical assistance – in bilateral meetings with Russian representatives and in public statements, including in the Council of Europe and also in the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Russia holds special responsibility for respecting human rights in the illegally annexed Crimean Peninsula. The rights to legal counsel, access to consular officers and health care must be fully respected. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has noted that Crimean Tatars continue to be disproportionately affected by police raids and prosecutions in respect of offences related to terrorism and extremism, in proceedings that fall short of human-rights standards. All pending cases of violations and abuses should be thoroughly investigated. The human-rights situation in non-government-controlled areas of eastern Ukraine, where Russia plays a significant role, is also deeply worrying. The overall environment for human-rights and civil-society activists in Russia is characterised by restriction on fundamental freedoms. At a time of international awareness of climate issues, violent assaults on individual environmental activists, such as Andrei Rudomakha and his colleagues, and the judicial harassment of others, such as the non—governmental organisation Eco-Defence, are deeply troubling. We recall that it is the duty of the Russian authorities to respect and protect the right of all illegally detained Ukrainian citizens and the rights of Russian citizens and activists, in line with Russia’s international human-rights commitments. I conclude by reaffirming our strong commitment to, and support for, human rights and civil society, including environmental activists in Russia, as well as illegally detained Ukrainians in particular. The European Union has consistently called on Russia to ensure that human-rights violations in Russia and the Crimean Peninsula are investigated and that accountability and justice for victims are ensured.
