It is also described in the Commission’s 2015 Annual Report on Gender Equality published today. Equality between women and men is one of the Union’s fundamental values; it has been present as a legal obligation in our Treaties since the very beginning of the integration. Our societies have progressed enormously in the past sixty years, and the position of women has advanced a great deal. Women have more access to employment than ever before. There is no denying that we are moving forward. But there are still inequalities which persist.  However, if we continue at this pace, it will take us another 70 years to achieve gender equality. Still, for every hour of women’s work, they take home 16% less than men. Still, fathers spend about an hour per day taking care of the children and the house, while mothers devote three hours. Parents, and mothers far more than fathers, face such great challenges in combining their private life with their work.  This threatens women’s economic independence and can lead families into poverty, especially, but not only, if the woman is the sole breadwinner of the family. This also has consequences on women’s pensions and risk of poverty in old age. Nowadays, women’s pensions are 40% lower than men’s pensions on average, and this gap shows no sign of narrowing.  We need to accelerate the positive changes of the previous decades, to create the kind of society where every boy and girl can thrive.  Please allow me to reflect on three key issues on how to move towards a more equal Europe. Women make up half of the European population. There are more men than women in most levels of management and supervisory positions, and there are more men than women in national parliaments in all Member States, and also in this House. In the largest publicly listed companies registered in the EU countries, only a little over 20% of all board members are women. The Commission’s proposal to achieve greater gender balance on boards of listed companies aims to tackle this inequality by ensuring that boards consist of at least 40% of both sexes. We must get this adopted, and you must help advocate it in the Member States, which are still reluctant. Secondly, we have to make it easier for European citizens to combine the responsibilities they have at work with the responsibilities they have at home. Later this year, the Commission intends to present a package of legislative and non-legislative proposals aimed at improving the work-life balance of employees. It will be well-rounded, dealing with the accessibility and affordability of high quality childcare, leave arrangements for fathers, mothers and carers, and flexible work arrangements.  It will be an important contribution to the integration of women in the labour market, which is demographically and economically necessary. It is also an important contribution in the European growth process.  And finally, there is a persisting gender-based violence. In the European Union, one in three women has been physically attacked, sexually attacked or both.  Last week, the European Commission proposed the EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention, the first ever legally binding instrument to combat violence against women at international level. The accession of the EU to the Istanbul Convention is a key step under our ‘Strategic Engagement’. The Convention’s holistic approach to this complex phenomenon is in tune with the EU approach.  The accession of the EU will provide greater efficiency and coherence in combating and preventing violence against women where there are already common EU rules, as well as in the more effective use of EU programmes and funds.  It will strengthen our common credibility and accountability externally. It will contribute to wider EU objectives of gender equality, anti—discrimination and economic growth. Further, I have been working with Commissioner Thyssen to ensure the follow-up of the survey conducted by the Fundamental Rights Agency (FRA) in 2013. This survey on gender—based violence would be led by Eurostat and carried out by national statistical offices with EU support and funding. Eurostat will start working towards such a survey, as announced in its Annual Work Programme. The Strategic engagement for gender equality 2016-2019 clearly identifies all the above-mentioned areas as a priority within our work to promote gender equality, including on equal economic independence. The strategy sets out, in addition to the key actions, that gender equality will continue to be promoted through the integration of a gender-equality perspective into every aspect of EU intervention, such as the preparation, design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, legal measures and spending programmes. Let me conclude by underlining that improving the socio-economic situation of women and promoting actions to stop violence against women are the top priorities for the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Constance LE GRIP", "mepid": "101580", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Madam President, Commissioner, thank you for your words, which show a very strong personal and political commitment, both in your capacity as Commissioner in charge of the issue of equality between men and women. You have given us a number of clarifications, you have pointed out a number of avenues and you have testified, once again, to the main priorities of the European Commission in terms of improving the socio-economic situation of women and combating violence against women. This is also the two main challenges for my group, the EPP Group, on whose behalf on behalf of this International Women's Day. Improving the socio-economic situation of women is simply an issue of competitiveness, an issue of equality, an issue of justice between men and women. It is about improving the economic situation of our continent through the fight against the human waste that represents the non-fulfilment of the female potential. Women in Europe are just as well trained, just as well educated as men, and therefore there is a real waste, a real loss of human resources and a loss of potential not to give women all the place and responsibilities they can aspire to in the labour market. We, the EPP Group, are particularly concerned, of course, and we will be actively working in the coming weeks and months on the instruments, on the avenues for improvement that can be proposed, which can be implemented on the initiative of the European institutions, but we will mainly ask The Member States to meet their responsibilities in terms of reducing wage inequality and reducing pension inequalities. The reduction of the gender pay gap and the gender pension gap seems to us to be, in terms of improving the socio-economic situation of women, the two main issues on which we must make rapid progress in the coming months.

Speaking on behalf of the S&amp;D Group, I certainly congratulate the Commission, which has decided to propose to the European Union, as a cross-border organisation, accession to the Istanbul Convention. This would only be the second United Nations convention to which the European Union will become a country, but I would really very much like, and I wish both myself and all my colleagues and the Commission, that laws and decisions in favour of both women and men in the European Union would be remembered and taken not only on this day. And indeed, for women and for improving their socio-economic situation in Europe, we can and must do much more.  First of all, we need to create and ensure that women are more successful in re-combining work and private life. Let us admit that even in the 21st century, we have not been able to In Europe, this responsibility is most often borne by women. What can we do to prevent a woman with a family from having a job and giving up personal professional development so that a working mother finally has time for both herself and her health care? We need to legislate to ensure maternity, paternity and parental leave.  Finally, we need to legislate to take care leave for family members – disabled or old family members – without losing their jobs. Finally, it is necessary to invest to achieve the Barcelona objectives so that our children have educational and educational opportunities (I am talking about the sufficiency of crèches, the adequacy of places in kindergartens). Finally, we need to work with the social partners to find innovative solutions that allow working people to reconcile work and family responsibilities.

The EU Commission continues to refuse to include and recognise value added by mothers in the national accounts. Gary Becker has won his Nobel Prize with models to make the added value of families and especially mothers visible. The OECD has already recognised this, and so has the United Nations. The services and work provided by the families and especially by the mothers – that is, by women – are a hard-hitting economic factor. Value creation begins with appreciation.

And I would say one more thing: it is our interest, it is the only thing that will make us go further and it will make us devote all the efforts to what we have to dedicate them, which is to achieve equality in the world. This obligation not only becomes, many times, a drag on women, even though, as we well remembered, we are the majority of the population, but it has different drifts.  And on this International Women's Day 2016, we are still faced with a huge pay gap , which is actually on average 16%, but there are countries, like mine, Spain, where it is close to 25%; we find ourselves at greater risk of poverty for women because the pension gap is also huge; we also find that the economic crisis has reduced women's access to the labour market and their wages are becoming lower; and we also find that we continue to have enormous inequality in board of directors and management positions.  For all this, we have instruments, gentlemen. To all this, we have the European Parliament as a co-legislator and I repeat the 'co' to advance that legal obligation that we have to achieve equality.  To this end, we have the Maternity Directive , pending a new proposal – or paternity, or parental leave, let us call it whatever it is, but which is real and appropriate for today's European families.  We must have the capacity to take forward the Women on Boards Directive because very few countries, including the current Presidency, which are blocking this agreement, and it is in our interest: reaching 40% is not capricious; it's about speeding up time.

I am a bit tired of repeating exactly the same things and the same formulas every year, because the socio-economic situation of women in Europe is simple: inequality has increased, the wage gap has increased, unemployment has increased, violence on women has increased and often in the most brutal way. In my country, for example, 29 women died of domestic violence in my country alone last year and the problem is, in fact, political.  I think it would be important for the Commission not to deal with this socio-economic inequality only with quota issues and words, that it brought politics because, as I said, the problem is political.

This modern-day form of slavery is on the rise in the EU and I am afraid the EU is to blame. Because we are forced to have open borders, the EU is enabling cross-border gangs to operate freely.

Even Europol admitted that free movement policies make it harder to detect these crimes.  So what have all the EU gender initiatives, funding and quangos actually achieved?

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her As of 8 March 2016, women are also socio-economic, and women are lagging far behind in terms of pay and career opportunities – although they vary widely in the Member States of the European Union, but nevertheless. This is despite the fact that women have long been in the fast lane when it comes to educational attainment. Numerous studies show that companies perform better with female leaders and that generations of women, politicians have fought for integration and gender equality. Women earn on average 16% less than men in the European Union, with the gender pay gap wide in the Member States: from 2.9% in Slovenia to 6.5% in Italy to 22.9% in Austria and 28.3% in Estonia. Much of this gap can be explained by children and, consequently, by a high proportion of part-time workers among women. Almost one in three women with one child work part-time in the EU, but only one in 20 men. In Austria, in my own country, two thirds of all mothers work part-time. And the more children a woman has, the more likely they are to work part-time. It is similar in leadership positions. Studies show that returns for shareholders are on average 53% higher and profit margins 42% better if at least one woman sits on the board. According to a study by the renowned Peterson Institute for Economics in Washington, a 30% increase in women's in management brings 15% more revenue. In addition to sales and profit, the market value also increases by an average of 5% when women are represented on the executive floor. So the facts and figures speak for themselves.

So the European Union cannot deal with it, only the asylum issue, the refugee issue. However, we see that it is about 10% of the influx into Europe and people that actually come from war-related areas. What did they come up with? To think about a different kind of refugee status. Let us say that if women are fleeing being discriminated against or subjected to violence in their own country, but they also add that they are discriminated against, they have the subjective right to come to Europe, apply for refugee status or to be granted asylum.

Enshrined in the founding treaty of the EU lies the commitment to reach equality between women and men. Since this founding treaty, the EU has delivered a huge amount to bring us closer to that goal. It has brought us legislation on equal treatment, equal pay, parental leave, carer’s leave and protection for pregnant workers, to mention a few of the direct benefits. I know the difference that these pieces of legislation have made; I used them in the 20 years I was a trade union official. Women have benefitted, and continue to benefit, from EU membership, in pay packets, pension provision and protection at work. But no one can suggest that we have achieved that original aim of equality. We cannot, and must not, put our feet up. Recently, we have seen that women have suffered disproportionately as a consequence of austerity policies across the EU and through employment deregulation, which has led to greater temporary and insecure employment. Looking at the Commission’s Europe 2020 strategy, there is agreement that more needs to be done – boosting female employment, reducing the pay gap, getting women into positions of power, reducing the number of people in poverty – but targets in these areas without actions are meaningless.

Women are not in charge, do not earn as much money as men, do not participate in the labour market to the same extent, do more unpaid work and are poorer. Poverty particularly affects older women, as a result of a life without full rights.  Discrimination is in stock. For example, a Roma woman is suffering from the rise in racism in the EU in the form of discrimination and social exclusion. A woman who is lesbian or transsexual is also affected by the hatred that exists in society against LGBTQ people. There are numbers on this. Politicians talk about it just like we do now. They state that it is not right, that it has costs that are both human and economic, but it is human rights violations that are unfortunately accepted, because otherwise they would have done something about it a long time ago. Gender equality policy is something that is mentioned but not a priority. A telling example is how the Commission has downgraded the EU's gender equality work to a technicality, the work that should be led by a politically entrenched strategy describing how women and men in the EU should have the same power over their lives. For me as a feminist, this is totally unacceptable. The EU should have a high standard of human rights and gender equality. It is about our fundamental values. How long are we going to have a society where women, minorities and other vulnerable people are second-class citizens? What can we call ourselves as long as we do nothing concrete about this? Nothing but hypocrites. Personally, I'm not celebrating March 8th. I think it is a manifesto of the inequality that we only experience every day. I don't want a flower today, for example. It just proves that out of 365 days, 364 is not our days.

Without going any further, in this Parliament women preside over only ten of the twenty-five existing committees.  Secondly, we suffer from the worst working conditions, the ones with the highest unemployment rates, the ones with the greatest difference in pensions and a pay gap in the European Union of more than 16%. We carry on our backs, mostly, the economy of care, a work as invisible as necessary for social support. Finally, this difference is exacerbated between northern and southern Europe. The cuts in social rights imposed by austerity policies have a double burden on us. The deterioration of public services and the degradation of working conditions mean that we are the ones who bear the brunt of austerity.

For example, in the Czech Republic, even at a time of economic growth, we still have a gender pay gap of more than 12%, both in the civil service and in the business sector.  This is partly because women are employed in sectors where there are lower salaries, whether they are teachers, nurses, but above all women are engaged in childcare and needy family members.  The European Union cannot, from its level, tell the Member States what to do, but we can say from this level that we respect women who have children, that we respect women who have the courage to have more children, and that these women need to have adequate maternity leave, parental leave and also financial security at this time. From this level we can say that we also respect women who want to have children, want to have a family and want to continue their profession.

Women in Europe, too, suffer from a considerable socio-economic gap, a gap also confirmed in the report on the EU strategy for equality between men and women after 2015.  Although work is increasingly becoming an important aspect of women's identity, with a tendency for women in employment to grow, we still have a very low rate of female presence in decision-making processes. Women are under-represented on the boards of companies and companies, but even in the field of politics they have not yet gained the right space.

Let me just react briefly to the points Members raised in the discussion. On better work-life balance, some of you mentioned that we withdrew the Maternity Leave Directive. We did it to prepare something better, something which will be better fitting with current needs – if you remember, we could not continue with the Maternity Leave Directive because two—thirds of Member States simply said that they already have it or need something fresher, something newer. So we are preparing – and it is a priority for me for this year in the work package for 2016 – the package of legislative and non-legislative proposals which will improve the balance between work and family life. And exactly as you said here, this is to open up choices for women – it is nothing like dictating or under-estimating the role of mothers. At this moment, the situation is the following: many young women who studied at universities – and 60% university leavers are women – have to decide whether to have children or whether to have a career. This is not possible, and also from an economic point of view, it is so irrational. We need to create the conditions for women to have both children and a career with highly qualified work. I really do not like the saying that it is the right of women to have children. Of course it is. I am a mother, and it is the best role I have ever had or could have in my life. But still, is it not society which needs children? To put it in a very cynical, or economic, way, society needs children, society needs future taxpayers, and why should only women bear this burden? This is not sustainable anymore. So this is where we tried to work, and this is our direction in working on this new package. The new things we want to bring in with this package are not only better arrangements for women, but better arrangements for working parents, and this is the real result from the previous proposals. On the pay gap, of course we need to find the proper instruments to decrease the pay gap. You are right, the 16% average pay gap in some Member States is very high – and it is even higher because it is the average figure. The 39% or even 40% pension gap is something which is not tolerable anymore, and I keep pushing the Member States to introduce into their national social and tax legislation measures which will decrease this pension gap and pay gap, because it is created in a large percentage due to the fact that women are caring for their families. This is the vote of society, so we must find the right instruments over this year.  I do not want to speak for too long, so just to quickly address the issue of multiple discrimination which Ms Soraya Post spoke about: we face a very serious situation in Europe, because we see these horrible cases. I speak to people who work with Roma citizens, and I also spoke to many Roma citizens directly. They say that the women pay the accounts for the family, and they are the victims of violence from the side of those who require the money back. This is physical violence; it is nothing like soft pressure, and that is just one example. We need to do more in fighting multiple discrimination. A last comment on more women in decision-making positions: you know that I try to promote the Women on Boards Directive, and I would like to inform you that this directive has been changed quite considerably under my portfolio, because I wanted to make it more gender neutral. There was a myth – which really hindered the process – that the Women on Boards Directive meant that highly-qualified men experts would be replaced by some women. We only want fair competition, and I think this is a very good direction for this directive. I would like to see the Member States which already have the law, like Germany and France and some others, to help us achieve the same result in the other Member States. I want to say that for more women in the decision-making positions it must not be a matter of one directive. Let us not create legislation; let us create proper policy, because this concerns not only the business sphere, where I myself have some reservations about how far to go, but it especially concerns public life and public positions, politics, and also – I am the Commissioner for Justice – in the sphere of the judiciary, because there we also do not see many women in high positions.  So thank you very much. I will finalise this positive message to send to the men: the idea that women want to fight is wrong – we want to cooperate.

In this context, it is the state's task to provide free primary education and financial assistance to those whose access to education may be hindered, for example, by reason of their place of residence and to create a friendly educational infrastructure.

This report on women refugees and asylum seekers is about bringing a much—needed gender perspective to the way we in the European Union deal with those seeking safety within our borders. At present, there are worrying disparities in the way different Member States handle asylum claims, particularly where those claims are related to gender. As a result, women seeking asylum in the EU are not guaranteed consistent gender—sensitive treatment. Women refugees and women seeking asylum are too often confronted with policies which fail to meet acceptable standards and where sensitive policies regarding gender are not implemented in practice. This report recommends a new set of gender guidelines to address these shortcomings. Violence is, tragically, an everyday reality for women and girls fleeing conflict. I have heard horrifying reports of women being exploited and abused. Research shows that women and girl refugees face this kind of violence, assault, exploitation and sexual harassment at every stage of their journey, including on European soil. Women – and indeed children – who are entitled to claim asylum are being coerced into transactional sex and forced into prostitution to pay for travel documents or a place in a boat or on a lorry. Traffickers and smugglers are having a field day with these desperate people.  Women need safer alternatives, as this report sets out. Pressure on the asylum reception systems should never excuse failure to protect women from violence. Nor should women seeking asylum and women refugees experience any double standards. They should have the same rights as other victims of gender-based violence.  I very much welcome the news in the past few days that the Commission has proposed accession of the EU to the Istanbul Convention. The Istanbul Convention is the most comprehensive treaty on violence against women in the world today and requires states to interpret the Refugee Convention in a gender—sensitive manner. It also requires states to implement reception and asylum procedures which are sensitive to the needs of women and girls. The proposal will now be discussed in the Council and in this Parliament, whose consent is needed for the conclusion of the convention by the EU. Only 12 Member States have already ratified the Convention and another 13 have yet to do so. We also need to look at the longer term issues. We often talk of refugees as presenting a burden, or bringing only costs to the countries which host them. However, with adequate investment, this need not be the case in the longer term. As I know we are all aware, refugees have much to offer our societies in the longer term, but we need to think carefully and develop integration strategies that are relevant to everyone. Women have specific integration and inclusion needs, such as childcare and language training. Many will not have been active in the labour market, so we need to look at properly matching skills and training provision with labour market shortages. Over 30 years ago, this Parliament acknowledged the need for a gender—sensitive interpretation of the Refugee Convention in a resolution in 1984. This was even before the UNHCR adopted gender guidelines. It would therefore be a huge step backwards if we were to fail to adopt this resolution today. Women and children now make up the majority of those seeking protection in the EU. The UN estimates it is now 55%. It is vital that we have the necessary policies and procedures in place to meet their needs. We need an approach which takes account of gender at every stage of the journey undertaken by these women refugees and provide the kind of protection that they need – and should expect – from the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Mary HONEYBALL", "mepid": "5846", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Honeyball, and the shadow rapporteurs and Members who have contributed to this very important report for their excellent work. This report highlights a very important aspect of the migration crisis, ensuring the rights and needs of women and girls who are fleeing conflicts and wars.  According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, 20% of Mediterranean Sea arrivals since 1 January 2016 were women and 33% were children. The EU has international obligations to provide protection and humanitarian support to those who need it. I fully support Parliament’s general recommendation that safe and legal routes to the EU must be made available for those fleeing conflict and persecution. No legislation and policies relating to irregular migration should ever prevent access to protection inside the EU.  We need to provide credible alternatives to irregular migration and enhance our legal channels. The Commission will soon come up with proposals in this respect. We have to proactively ensure that the newly arrived will receive protection and are enabled to participate and fully integrate in our societies. The success of integration depends on its timelines. Women face much stronger barriers than other migrants, suffering from multiple disadvantages. We need to act on this. The provision of services has been tailored to the needs of women, considering in particular childcare responsibilities.  The Commission foresees presenting further steps on improving integration in April 2016. Of course, the gender dimension will play an important role in this respect. Let me underline how important the commitment and support of Member States is; they already have important instruments at their disposal: the European Social Fund as well as the Asylum Migration Integration Fund. Both should be used to better respond to women’s needs.  The Commission is working to address the challenge of protecting women from violence and the risk of exploitation and enslavement. As regards the fight against migrant smuggling, the Commission already presented an action plan last year. In this context, we will this year propose strengthening the existing legal framework.  The Commission has already set out various elements on the issue of trafficking in the European Agendas on Migration and Security and the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy for the years 2015 to 2019. I would also like to draw attention to a legal obligation on Member States to take measures to reduce demand, the importance of criminalisation, the use of services of victims and paying attention to all forms of exploitation. The Commission prioritises the fight against trafficking in human beings as a human rights issue. We raise this in dialogues with third countries.  Members call in particular on the EU to access the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women. I am happy to inform you that last week on 4 March 2016 the Commission adopted the proposal for the EU’s accession to this Convention, which is a comprehensive instrument to tackle the widespread phenomenon of violence against women. In conclusion, let me be clear. Europe will continue to provide protection for those who need it, including for women and girls seeking refuge in the EU. Actions of all the relevant stakeholders at European and national level should be mutually reinforcing and concerted efforts should translate into more protection and effective integration policies for women refugees.

I regret, however, that we have not succeeded on this International Women's Day in ironing out the differences that have been at each other in the way in which this report has been drawn up and drafted.  According to the most recent estimates, 38% of asylum seekers in Europe are women. In the light of this fact, therefore, I welcome the fact that, within the report, Mrs Honeyball has included all the references to a European migration policy that is sensitive to the needs of women and girls, refugees and asylum seekers who, after exhausting journeys, fleeing war and violence, arrive at the borders of the Union. I also welcomed the call for a humanitarian approach for those most vulnerable groups, such as pregnant women, children and the elderly, but at the same time I am critical of the inclusion in the text of paragraphs referring to asylum procedures, family reunification or the very expensive requests for legal advice from refugee women.

And, in this context, we must be aware that, in the face of the reality of hundreds of thousands of people crossing the Mediterranean and reaching the European Union, when they flee hunger, when they flee war, when they flee from fear, there is a part of this group that are even more vulnerable: refugee women. Women and girls. According to the latest UNHCR data, as far as the last few months, 55% of refugees arriving on European shores are women and girls. Women who lose everything, lose their dignity;  women who have to sell their bodies to pay for Europe's dream ticket; women who are raped; women who are victims of mafias dealing with people. And in the face of this situation, we cannot resign ourselves and we cannot remain impassive. We have an obligation to respond, because we are also talking about the dignity of the European Union's own project. We need to be able to implement integration policies, access to education, health services, public services, to promote the integration of these people. And I have no doubt that the solution to this problem is not to return these people to the other side of the Mediterranean. I have no doubt that Europe's responsibility has to be to resolve this situation, but also to be able to give an answer to the hundreds of thousands of people who are expecting that dream of Europe today and that we are returning it with a project that has nothing to do with what gave birth to this European Union project.

This is a great achievement and was possible only thanks to the very constructive spirit of the rapporteur, Ms Honeyball, and the majority of the shadows, with the aim of recognising and protecting vulnerable women. Female migration is not a new phenomenon, but it is increasing, as is the vulnerability of female refugees and migrants to human trafficking, exploitation, discrimination and abuse. However, some colleagues think that the best way to celebrate 8 March is to deprive women refugees and asylum seekers of, among other things, sexual health and reproductive rights and deny them the possibility of a faster and more efficient family reunification process. The division in the House clearly shows that the challenge ahead is not the refugee crisis, but is in fact a political crisis. In difficult times, gender equality and women’s rights are often neglected by organisations, decision makers and civil society and considered as a detail, a luxury, or, in fact, a complication. When in crisis mode, it is more difficult to see the gender perspective, but this does not mean that we can tolerate the fact that the EU is not protecting fundamental and human rights. Women seeking asylum need specific support, since we know that many reception centres are overcrowded and lack adequate lighting and separate spaces for single women and families with children.  I hope that this report will be perceived as a guideline for the work of the Commission and the Council in order to have a truly holistic approach, also tackling the causes of violence against women, including smuggling and trafficking, and integrating more women in peace processes in order to avoid and solve the conflicts that are at the origin of every refugee crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 66, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Malin BJÖRK", "mepid": "124992", "text": "  On behalf of the GUE/NGL Group.

That is absolutely right. I will focus on two things, safe escape routes and family reunification, although there is a great deal more important in this report.  Safe escape routes are particularly important for women and girls because their escape route makes them particularly vulnerable. Safe roads, humanitarian corridors are therefore particularly important. The fact that the EU is now closing its borders is hitting women and girls particularly hard, and that is why it is an unacceptable path that the EU has chosen to take. Family reunification: The restrictions imposed by several countries through temporary residence permits and complicated family reunification are a blow to everyone in the family, but especially to women and children who are more likely to remain in precarious and insecure areas of conflict. It is inhumane to separate children from their parents and parents from their children and it must stop.

First of all, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Mrs Honeyball, who has really laid a good foundation with an excellent report. It is about the situation of female refugees. Female and male refugees have many similar problems: they are afraid of being separated from their group, they are hungry, they have the cold, they have lack of prospects, the physical rigours, the concern for the future. All this is experienced by women and men on the run.  But women still have to endure additional realities. They often travel with children, and often they are pregnant. They have often also fled from situations where they have already been threatened by violence or subjected to violence. They are still not doing well on the run. They are experiencing violence, some of them from other refugees. But they also experience violence from helpers, and they experience violence from men in the countries they are crossing. And they pay. They not only pay with money from the smugglers, but they also pay with their bodies. This is very important to mention here once again on International Women's Day.

They are vulnerable to the convenience of people smugglers, and often to official authoritarians, while in many cases they are also responsible for caring for children. They therefore need special protection and support. I welcome the fact that the report on the situation of refugee women deals extensively with the situation of refugee women and proposes solutions to their specific problems. Of these, I consider it particularly important that women should be given priority protection in refugee camps and reception centres. Be safe places for them, do not suffer disadvantages in food and access to drinking water. It is also very important that refugee women have continuous access to medical assistance and psychological support for the processing of traumas. It is also crucial that refugee women are widely informed about their rights, actions and opportunities throughout the asylum process, of course in their mother tongue. Away from their birthplace, often away from their families, this is the only way they have a chance of not being completely vulnerable. We must also remember that we must ensure that every single refugee girl is properly trained and that women are given the opportunity to receive training and education during integration.

In fact, since January this year, more than half of asylum seekers have been women and children. Number in itself is not the most important thing, but as the proportion of women in refugees increases, so does the need for an asylum policy that takes women more into account. Women have special needs, especially when it comes to health services and safety. We can make it easier for female asylum seekers to operate by fairly simple means, such as providing them with locked accommodation and training interviewers to identify women's areas of expertise, which would enable them to become more quickly involved in working life and other social activities.

Some governments spend massive millions of public money to increrate hatred and create fear against those seeking refuge here. The crisis has certainly taught Europeans one thing: to be human in inhumanity, even if it is so difficult. About half of the world's refugees are women or girls. Women and girls deprived of the protection provided by their homes, governments and often their families are more vulnerable to various threats. In addition to the adversity of escapism, they are often subjected to harassment or indifference by officials, often subjected to sexual harassment, and this is often the case even in the environment where shelter is supposed to be safe.

Mrs Coceres was a shining example for the many who fought with great courage on the front line to ensure that the country and the rights of the indigenous people of Honduras are respected. Mrs Coceres was personally known to many of her fellow Members here in the House and has worked closely with many of them over the years. The European Parliament therefore condemns this incident in the strongest possible terms and encourages the Government of Honduras to do everything in its power to bring the perpetrator or perpetrators to justice. In addition, we will continue to work hard to protect human rights defenders such as Mrs Caceres around the world. I sincerely hope that this tragic event will not discourage other activists, but will encourage them in their fight for human rights, for which so many people have sacrificed their lives, especially in Honduras. We – and I believe that all those who have known Mrs Céceres – will remember her in an honorable memory. Mr Grandi, Commissioner for Refugees, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for Refugees and Human Affairs and Human Affairs. Today, 8 March, the European Parliament is, as it does every year, here in plenary, on International Women's Day. But this year, a lot is different. We are in the midst of the biggest refugee and migration crisis since the end of the Second World War. It is therefore self-evident, and I also believe logically, that on 8 March 2016 we should pay particular attention to the women affected by this crisis. Since this February, the number of women and children coming to Europe has exceeded the number of male refugees. And we all know that women are particularly vulnerable and, on the run like the one that many have taken, are exposed to a variety of dangers. We see this every day and we receive dramatic reports every day – about discrimination, humiliation, violation of their dignity and the deprivation of fundamental human rights. And conditions continue to deteriorate as thousands are stranded in overcrowded camps and do not know where and if they will be given the opportunity to start their lives anew. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament is united in its fight against all forms of violence against women, whether in their home countries, during the flight, but also at the destinations. We owe it to the people who fought so hard for the rights of women on this continent, to the many courageous women who fought for women's rights for decades, such as the first President of this House, Mrs Simone Veil, to name but one name from our own ranks. I am aware that the legacy of these women is not irreversible. On the contrary, nothing is guaranteed forever. That is why the rights that have been defended must be re-defended every day. I am therefore pleased that the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, has come to our extraordinary meeting.

It is an honour for me to be with you today to mark International Women’s Day and to speak about it from the perspective of the United Nations’ refugee organisation. Last month I was on the Greek island of Lesbos where I saw the Hellenic Coast Guard bring in a boat it had just rescued at sea. The boat was carrying 200 people. Most were women with children, some of them very small, many elderly and a few sick people. As they were disembarking, I spoke with several of them and they told me stories of the conflicts they fled from in Syria or Afghanistan, the dangers of their journey and worries about what the future would bring. They were just one of many examples of today’s global displacement crisis.  Over 60 million people worldwide have been forced to flee. On average, 42 500 are forced to flee their homes every day. Half of them are women. Even though the vast majority of these uprooted people, 86%, are in other continents, Europe is now also seeing record numbers of refugees and migrants arriving on its shores. As you know very well, in 2015 a million people arrived in Europe, crossing the Mediterranean in unseaworthy dinghies and flimsy boats. We have all seen the images of the piles of discarded life jackets on the Greek beaches of those who survived the perilous journey. More than 3 700 people did not make it: a tragic testimony of our collective failure to properly address their plight. This year, to date, 138 000 refugees and migrants have arrived in southern Europe. In public opinion the image is often that of young single men arriving in Europe to look for work. Today, on International Women’s Day, I wish to report instead that nearly two-thirds are women and children, up from last year’s 41%.  Take for example Fatima, who fled the war in Syria. She was found in a state of shock in the port of the Greek island of Samos. She was severely traumatised and injured. She had suffered violence at the hands of the man she had been travelling with. She was taken to a hospital for treatment and there she revealed that her husband had entrusted her and their young daughter to a man she did not know to get her to a safe country in Europe. During this journey the man confiscated all their travel documents, mobile phone and money. He abused Fatima and denied her direct contact with her husband. Fatima is just one of thousands of women and girls who are making the journey on their own, fleeing violence and persecution only to face a similar ordeal on their way to Europe, a place where they had hoped and expected to find sanctuary. Many desperate people worldwide view Europe as a safe and prosperous place that stands up for human rights and welcomes refugees. Most, for lack of better, safer alternatives choose the services of smugglers at their great risk. Let me also be clear on an important fact that is often overlooked. The majority of the people arriving in Europe, 88%, come from the world’s top 10 refugee producing countries, chief among them Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq, but also Eritrea and Somalia. This has been, and essentially remains, a refugee movement. The number of women and children among them is increasing rapidly, as I have said, and many travel without male relatives. We also see a large number of pregnant women, or women with babies and small children, among the arrivals. A recent UNHCR study found that 20% of the Syrians arriving in Greece were families headed by women, without husband or father. Just as Fatima, these women and children are exposed to abuse and sexual violence at the hands of unscrupulous smugglers or are at great risk when they travel along insecure routes, having to stay in places that lack basic security, such as parks, bus or train stations or at the road side. In Greece we have seen a rapid build-up of stranded refugees and migrants, currently over 35 000, who as a result of border closures in the Western Balkans have been denied access into the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. This has had a direct impact on women and girls, who are suffering disproportionately and are at great risk of sexual exploitation and trafficking. We at UNHCR, with our partners, support local authorities in all affected areas to improve reception conditions and to provide assistance to people in need. We have taken measures to reduce risks and help women along the way. Many reception areas and transit points now have separate facilities for women and children. Together with Unicef and the International Committee of the Red Cross, we have set up 20 child and family support hubs. These hubs, also known as ‘Blue Dots’, provide a safe place for women and children, where they can find all available services and information about their options in a single location. The hubs aim to help vulnerable women and children on the move and mitigate the risks of trauma, violence, exploitation and trafficking. However, we need more than a humanitarian response. On other continents, countries with far fewer means than Europe have been responding to much larger movements of people forced to leave their homes and continue to do so. In this very Chamber, exhortations to states around the world to treat refugees according to principles and in an organised manner have resonated many times. Such exhortations now apply to Europe. This emergency does not have to be a crisis. It can be managed. As you know, yesterday the European Union Heads of State or Government met with Turkey on the onward movement of refugees and migrants to Europe. We were not party to these conversations and understand that discussions on the details are still ongoing. But as a first reaction, I am deeply concerned about any arrangement that would involve the blanket return of anyone from one country to another without spelling out the refugee protection safeguards under international law.  (Applause)  An asylum seeker should only be returned to a third state if the responsibility for assessing the particular asylum application in substance is assumed by the third country, the asylum seeker will be protected from refoulement, and if the individual will be able to seek and, if recognised, enjoy asylum in accordance with accepted international standards, and have full and effective access to education , work, healthcare and, as necessary, social assistance. These safeguards would need to be set out legally and would need to govern any mechanism under which responsibility would be transferred for assessing an asylum claim. Pre-departure screening would also need to be in place to identify heightened risk categories that may not be appropriate for return, even if the above conditions are met. Turkey is already hosting nearly three million refugees and it is important for the international community to share this responsibility more widely. We welcome, of course, any initiative that promotes regular pathways of admission for refugees in significant numbers from all neighbouring countries in the region – not just Turkey and not just Syrian refugees – to third countries. We hope that this will happen and that it will also apply to other countries in the region that also host a considerable number of refugees, such as Lebanon and Jordan. In fact, UNHCR has been calling on states to increase the different legal routes for the admission of Syrian refugees so that they do not have to resort to people smugglers and to dangerous journeys. These pathways include resettlement, humanitarian admission, private sponsorship and refugee—friendly family reunion, as well as student scholarships and labour mobility schemes. A key opportunity to advance these solutions for Syrian refugees will be on 30 March, in Geneva, when UNHCR will convene a high-level meeting on global responsibility sharing through pathways for admission of Syrian refugees. States will be invited to pledge concrete commitments. We hope that up to 10% of the Syrian refugee population in the region, which currently stands at 4.7 million, can benefit from these pathways. I still believe that to properly address the flow of refugees and migrants in Europe we need a coordinated European response, based on solidarity, political leadership and the sharing of responsibilities to stabilise the situation and manage the movement of people more effectively. Last Friday, we presented a set of practical proposals to the European Union and its Member States that would help achieve that. These proposals remain valid. They focus on improving registration and referral processes, including the relocation schemes within Europe. It remains imperative that relocation works and that the necessary places are made available. With the support of the Commission, for which we are grateful, we also need to boost the emergency response capacity in Greece. UNHCR is on the ground with its partner, working closely in support of the Greek authorities. Finally and looking forward, we must build on the lessons we have learned. It is crucial to strengthen compliance with and uphold the standards of the Common European Asylum System, even in times of emergency. It is of paramount importance to prevent further suffering and loss of life and to strengthen protection safeguards for people at risk, in particular women and unaccompanied children. This includes improving search and rescue operations, developing coordinated systems to protect and help unaccompanied children, and establishing measures to prevent and respond to sexual and gender-based violence. We need a new approach to develop an effective European asylum system, not only to manage the current refugee and migrant movement, but also for the future. We have to ensure that Member States located at the external borders of the European Union will not continue to bear the disproportionate burden in addressing immediate reception needs. The solidarity that is so essential today for Greece and Italy may well be required for other states in the future. Next week, the conflict in Syria will enter its sixth year. More than 4.7 million people, as I have said, have sought asylum in the region and 6.5 million people are internally displaced. Inside Syria, it is estimated that 13.5 million people are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 4.5 million in hard—to—reach areas. With the cessation of hostilities now holding for 10 days, the United Nations organisations, including UNHCR, have been able to deliver some much-needed humanitarian aid to people who have suffered years of war and deprivation. Meanwhile, in the neighbouring countries, despite the generosity of host governments and communities, Syrian refugees are facing increasingly difficult living conditions after five years in exile. A recent study we conducted with the World Bank found that in Jordan and Lebanon, 90% of the Syrian refugees are living under the national poverty line, as they have little access to legal work and many, by now, have depleted any resources they had brought with them. At last month’s London Conference, the international community pledged EUR 10 billion for activities that are meant to help the refugees and the host communities in improving education and livelihood opportunities. States must now honour the pledges made at the conference. This is very urgent in stabilising the refugees in the region and we need to take advantage of the window of opportunity given to us by the cessation of hostilities in Syria. But Syria is not the only country in the region beset by violence. In 2015, the escalation of violence in Iraq resulted in waves of new displacement. During the last two years alone, nearly 3.3 million people have been displaced across the country. Sixteen percent of the people arriving in Europe today are from Iraq. And after more than three decades, Afghans remain one of the largest refugee populations in the world, with some 2.6 million registered refugees. The vast majority of them live in Pakistan and Iran. An upsurge in violence in the second half of 2015 caused significant levels of displacement inside the country and across the border, including many unaccompanied children who try to reach Europe. Today, in Afghanistan, 31 out of 34 provinces are affected by conflict, with more than one million people registered as internally displaced, an increase of 78% compared to last year. Twenty-five percent of the people arriving in Europe are Afghans and many have urgent protection needs. Elsewhere in the world, conflict continues to disrupt lives and uproot people. Our refugee programmes in Africa remain severely underfunded, while the number of wars and displaced people increases rapidly: northern Nigeria, the Central African Republic, South Sudan and Burundi, just to name a few. The Horn of Africa remains the theatre of multiple displacement situations, especially Somali refugees. In many of the protracted displacement situations in Africa, however, we can hardly give the refugees more, and even sometimes we give them less than the bare minimum to survive. In many countries they are not allowed to work legally, so they remain dependent on very scarce aid. In South-East Asia, in the Bay of Bengal, more than 33 000 refugees and migrants, mostly Rohingya and Bangladesh nationals took to smugglers boats last year. Many died, the majority not from drowning as we see in the Mediterranean Sea, but from abuse at the hands of people smugglers, abandonment and disease. We also have a very specific refugee crisis in Central America, where thousands of Salvadorians, Hondurans and Guatemalans are fleeing deadly transnational gang violence. Again, International Women’s Day is an opportunity to remember that most of them are women and children. They use the traditional migration routes, going north to find safety and a future, but many are indeed refugees fleeing violence, extortion and persecution. In a world riddled with conflict, mass population movement is a reality. Building fences and walls to keep people out is not a solution. It will only increase the suffering of the people who have already suffered the unimaginable.  (Applause)  And women everywhere are among the most exposed. In the face of massive displacement and arrivals, very often the first reaction of politicians is to resort to scaremongering. Manipulation of public opinion and inciting hate against those who are different are unacceptable. A real response can only be based on solidarity and human rights, on responsibility sharing and respect for international law. Today we celebrate the many achievements we have made on the road to gender equality and the participation of women in social, economic and political life since International Women’s Day was first observed in 1975. It is also a moment to think about the long way ahead to reach full parity. But it is equally a day on which to reflect on the fact that discrimination and exclusion, because of ethnicity, religion and gender, are among the main root causes of conflict and persecution and, ultimately, of forced displacement. In 27 countries, for example, women still do not have the same rights as men to confer their nationality on their children. Many of the women arriving in Europe come from these countries, including Syria and Iraq. That means that if the fathers are missing or there is no proof of paternal descent, their children will not have a nationality and are at risk of becoming stateless. This may affect access to healthcare and education, and affect their ability to return home when conditions allow. As we have said and heard countless times in the past 25 years, there are no humanitarian solutions to the political problems that are the root causes of massive forced displacement. There are no humanitarian solutions to the intractable wars, the upsurge in violence and the oppression and lack of governance in many parts of the world. We need political leadership and action, both to resolve the conflicts that cause displacement and to make sure that people like Fatima and her little daughter can find the protection and safety they need without having to resort to criminal networks and smugglers who abuse and exploit them. These are not abstract concepts about which to make abstract statements. They are real, brutal facts which only courageous political leadership and considerate, forward-looking decisions based on international cooperation, respect for human rights, solidarity between states and a renewed sense of humanity can counter and redress. Europe is facing a moment of truth. This is the time to reaffirm the values upon which it was built.

The sheer number of people arriving on Greek shores and travelling through the Western Balkans, and the numbers we read daily in the press, risk making us forget that these are individuals and human beings, many of them vulnerable and in need of protection: many women travelling alone despite the dangers they are facing, many mothers risking their own and their children’s lives. Let me assure you that the European Commission does not forget, and does not forsake its humanitarian duties. Yes, we have to take control of the flows, make them more manageable and lower them. Yes, we need to better manage our external borders, for the European Union, for the Member States and for their citizens, but also for the people arriving. Yes, we need to stop – also with the help of Europol – the business of smugglers that send people in their thousands every day to a possible death. Instead of dangerous routes, it is our responsibility to create more legal pathways for people in need of protection to be able to come to Europe directly, legally and safely. That is why I continue to call on Member States not only to deliver on the resettlement commitments they made in July last year and for the Turkey humanitarian admission scheme, but also to commit to more, and soon. All irregular migrants who have arrived through Turkey will be returned to Turkey in accordance with European and international law. For the people who are already here, we need to improve the situation. That is why we have proposed a humanitarian assistance scheme to be used within the EU. It is why we urgently need to proceed to large-scale relocations, and why we need to further develop reception capacities. And in all of these things, the UNHCR is our steady and quintessential partner, and I look forward to continuing to work closely together with Filippo Grandi, a person who has come to lead the UNHCR in the midst of the refugee crisis, and also a veteran on these issues: he is a man with commitment to the cause of refugees , and I count very much on his invaluable help. Let me therefore once again welcome the close cooperation that we have established with the UNHCR and express my strong appreciation of the work done by the UNHCR in the current crisis. UNHCR support is highly valued inside and outside Europe. The European Commission and the UNHCR work closely together to help Italy and, especially, Greece in accommodating and relocating migrants, but also in resettling them from the outside. Together with the UNHCR we need now to ensure a quick implementation of the voluntary humanitarian scheme from Turkey and to implement projects that will further improve the situation of Syrians in Turkey. As you know, our actions are not limited to the borders of Europe. The fact that over 60 million people are refugees or internally displaced persons across the globe reminds us that we should not lose sight of the fact that migration is not a European issue only; it is a global challenge. Everyone in the international community should take their share of the responsibility. All developed countries across the world should respond to the call of the United Nations for resettlement from the affected regions. The pledging conference organised by the UNHCR for 30 March will be the next opportunity. And we need to reflect together on how to positively address the phenomenon which characterises our era, our world: people’s mobility, a phenomenon which is expected to increase for many different reasons, to take different forms and to be directed on different routes. We cannot ignore people’s mobility. We can neither deny it, nor stop it. We need to prepare ways to respond to it without destabilising our societies, but rather by turning it into a two-way opportunity for the hosting countries and the migrants. We believe, therefore, that it is Europe’s duty and in its interest to support key partners managing the migratory flows and addressing the roots causes of the displacements. Dealing with the global migration crisis requires, therefore, solid partnerships, enhanced cooperation and coordination with third countries and with regional and international organisations. In other words, it needs a global strategy. In a multifaceted and complex refugee crisis like the one of today, there cannot be a one-size-fits-all approach, and it cannot be the responsibility of just one country or one stakeholder. We all need each other, and we need to work together. That is why the relationship and collaboration between the European Union and the UNHCR is of utmost importance.

Being born a woman should be the same as being born a man, but it's not: that's a fact. In many countries around the world, women have fewer rights and less freedom: that's a fact. In Europe, women have the same rights and freedoms in the law, but not in reality: that is also a fact.  I myself, if I were a woman, would have had infinitely more difficult to come here today, on International Women's Day, to defend women's equality. That's a fact, too.  There are many people who find the usefulness of an international women's day debatable, but it is indisputable that there are millions of reasons, millions of facts justifying this International Women's Day.  There are millions of girls who do not go to school because they are girls; there are millions of women who charge less for the same job because they are women. There are millions of old ladies who will never retire because they are grandmothers.  There are millions of women mistreated, beaten, wounded, mutilated, humiliated because they are women, and many of them are even poor.  In Europe, 3,500 women die every year killed by their partners, killed by men: eight, every day; eight, today. One in three women over the age of fifteen has ever experienced sexual harassment throughout her life. We have better intentions than the Taliban, of course, but we have nothing to brag about.  Today the United Nations High Commissioner is asking us to look into the eyes of refugee women, the most vulnerable, who are fleeing not only machismo: also war.  Those who always run away with their children – because how rare it is for a man to take the children when he has to flee; which by the system and by the mafias are forced into sexual exploitation. Those that have causes of their own to flee, such as genital mutilation or rape used as a weapon of war.  In the last year, in the Mediterranean, fleeing Syria, 55% of the people who drowned were women and children. In the face of a humanitarian drama like the one we are experiencing, the solutions we are listening to are becoming more and more inhumane. Putting barriers to the inhumane flight of women with children to be difficult dehumanizes us, not them.  A society unable to feel mercy for a mother who begs asylum with her baby in a cardboard box is a heartless society, it is an inhumane society. It's not, of course, ours.  Being a woman, being born a woman is a blessing. Getting women's rights and freedoms to be, in fact, equal to the rights and freedoms of men is a task, it is a challenge not only for today, but for our whole lives, if we really want to call ourselves \"European\" dignity.

On international women's rights day and by your presence, Un High Commissioner for Refugees, we highlight the living, and sometimes survival, conditions of these women. For my part, I will give the floor to one of them, Reem, a young Syrian girl. I quote: \"I never got to sleep in the camps, I was too afraid that someone would touch me. The tents were all mixed and I witnessed violence. Women can't really complain and don't want to cause problems that could disrupt their trip.\" This testimony, collected by Amnesty International, is not that of a woman in Syria, Iraq or, I do not know where, who is plagued by endemic violence. This is happening here in Europe, as these women flee the horror of war in their home countries, they continue to experience the fear of aggression at every stage of their journey. What Reem's heartbreaking testimony reminds us is that migration policies have so far given too little weight to the issue of gender. The revision of the \"Asylum\" package has helped to raise the bar a little, but implementation on the ground is still far too weak. As my colleague Mary Honeyball's report recommends, this particular attention to migrant women must be given at all stages of their journey. This means from the asylum procedure itself, through the reception conditions and to the integration measures. It also means that reception staff need to be trained. This includes the establishment of sanitary facilities and non-mixed dormitories and access to adequate health care. What Reem's testimony also reminds us forcefully is that there is an urgent need to act together. The European Union and its Member States can no longer continue to multiply European summits without taking decisions on effective and collective actions to combat the humanitarian and moral crisis, in which the European Union is currently plunged. However, there are ways to create and strengthen the opening of legal and safe routes to Europe, but I see this as the best way to combat smugglers, who continue to enrich themselves; we have an effective mechanism of intra-European solidarity for a fair sharing of responsibilities - relocations from Greece or Italy, which are currently taking place on a drip-feed basis (600 people, I believe) must be implemented with political will. We also look forward to the Commission's proposal for a revision of the Dublin Regulation and we hope that this revision will drastically change the foundations; ensure full and consistent application of the common European asylum system throughout the EU, so that seeking asylum in Europe does not continue to be akin to a lottery or shopping; and strengthen cooperation with third countries of transit and origin, in clearly defined and balanced terms, including in particular compliance with human rights obligations. In the aftermath of the EU-Turkey summit, this balance is particularly crucial.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 115, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Timothy KIRKHOPE", "mepid": "4542", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, as the UK Minister responsible for resettlement during the Bosnian crisis, I saw first-hand just what war does to a country, to its people and to their hopes for the future, and I am proud to be from a Europe that does not turn its back on the rest of the world. But the sad truth is that when some European leaders opened their doors last year to everyone seeking a better life, it merely pushed the most desperate, the most vulnerable and the most in need to the back of an already very long queue. To truly help those people most in need, I have long believed the solution is direct resettlement from conflict regions. It reduces pull factors, it presents the tragic loss of life at sea, it reduces the demand for human trafficking, and it helps stabilise our external borders.  If the EU is to continue offering a Europe of opportunity, sanctuary and community cohesion, then the EU must realise that resettlement and controlled immigration flows must be the solution. High Commissioner, as rapporteur for the Permanent Relocation Mechanism, I would like to try to link that proposal with an ambitious UNHCR-led resettlement programme with the EU. Relocation in its current form is simply not working. Let us be truthful with each other: some Member States feel as though the system was forced on them, and migrants only want to go to certain Member States. It is not a recipe for a long-term successful system. Member States will not support relocation in a meaningful way until the external borders are secure, the flow of migrants has stabilised and we start to have a sense of the numbers we ultimately need to relocate.  Keeping Europe’s borders open with no clear plan or end in sight will only exacerbate the situation. We talk about safe legal routes to Europe. Resettlement achieves that. It helps ensure safe passage, especially for women and children to whom you have referred eloquently today, taking them out of the hands of evil human traffickers. Too many female refugees are facing exploitation. Too many unaccompanied minors are tragically unaccounted for today. Europe could offer more Syrians, more women and more children refuge if we could get control of this crisis. To put in place a fair and controlled immigration system does not mean you lack compassion, but simply ensures that you can give genuine refugees the safety, the stability and the opportunities they truly deserve.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 116, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Cecilia WIKSTRÖM", "mepid": "96677", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Grandi for his statements. Mr Grandi, you have taken up the post as High Commissioner at a time when unprecedented numbers of refugees have been approaching our shores. Within the space of two generations the refugee crisis has followed a financial crisis, and we can see how it is continuing to challenge the perception of our commitment to providing international protection to those entitled it. In Europe we tend to forget that we are living ever longer and, despite all our troubles, are still the richest continent on the planet. The very core of the global asylum system is currently being questioned by people who would prefer that the right of asylum was not an imperative right of an oppressed individual, but rather a kindness to be extended or withheld by the 28 Member States individually. I fear that in a world where states could choose whether to help refugees or not a lot of people in need would be left without protection, with irreversible tragic consequences, a cynical approach whereby the rich West dumps the challenges involved in receiving refugees onto developing third countries in order to sit back and hide behind walls, maybe sending a cheque every now and then so as to pretend to  care.  That is not an EU to which I wish to contribute  and, as the spokesperson on migration for the Liberal and Democrat Group and the rapporteur for this House on the upcoming revision of the Dublin Regulation, I can only give you, High Commissioner, a clear message that Liberals and Democrats in Europe will always stand up for the right to asylum. Whereas some people in this Chamber will claim that the choice is an either/or, that is to say, either you  support the UNHCR or you support the fundamental individual right of asylum, we will stand firmly by you and explain that you need both for the system to work. And, by the way, the UNHCR should be getting a lot more support, not least financially, from the EU. We are living in challenging times, but let us realise that this continent has never been in better shape to manage these challenges.

Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr The UN, and the UNHCR in particular, is a key player in maintaining respect for international asylum law. That's why it's especially important that you're here with us today. I find it unfortunate that you have not been invited to take more responsibility in terms of how europe formulates its responses to the refugee situation and your words today make me even more convinced of that concern. You also give us the bigger picture that yes, there is a global refugee crisis going on, but we do not have a refugee crisis here in Europe. You highlight wise things, important things, such as the need to strengthen the rights and security of women refugees. We have debated this this morning and we will be voting for a very good report later. You highlight the fact that Europe must receive more and that we must do so in a way that divides responsibility between our countries. You highlight that the policy of closed borders is not the way forward. We need to create legal avenues. We agree with you. We need to help unaccompanied minors better and our reception systems need to be improved. I was in Calais yesterday, and the situation I witnessed there, it is not compatible with human rights. We ask you to visit Calais and see and witness the situation and evaluate the situation there. You point out that we must combat racism and Islamophobia in Europe. We agree with you. Last but not least, we cannot allow Greece to become a refugee camp. We must take joint responsibility. Mr Grandi, the way in which the EU is now trying to come to terms with Turkey to keep the refugees away bears no trace of your proposals, not a trace. Allowing the refugees to return with the same boat they came in is simply not in line with international asylum law. Thank you for drawing attention to this.

The applause at the end of your speech showed you that we are very pleased that you have come here today and have reminded us, as the European Parliament, of the plight of women and children in this refugee crisis, the global refugee crisis. I think it is very good that you have once again awakened us with these individual examples, but also with these large figures, which show that we are dealing with a global problem. As Members of the European Parliament – at least by a majority still – we have recently been shocked that it has become so difficult in the European Union to implement the Geneva Convention on Refugees and the idea of political asylum. We in the European Union are shocked that, although this Union is made up of states that have all emerged from wars, from disasters, from the ravages of the last century, remembering what their own nation has been doing is no longer strong enough to adequately address this global crisis. I think that is one of the things that is why your speech is a speech that should shake us all up. If you look at what was discussed yesterday with Turkey and the European Union, it is clear that there is currently a very small check, and this pattern of 'one Syrian in, one Syrian out' should be something that shakes us up again, especially in the light of the speech you have made here. Because as much as we understand that we want to achieve an order through resettlement, we are disturbed by this so-called small approach to dealing with these big problems. In fact, I believe that you have made it clear to us that the Europeans as a whole have not yet grasped the dimension of the disaster and are therefore, on the whole, still trying to protect themselves from the disaster, and will therefore probably contribute to the worsening of the crises and disasters in our neighbourhood and in the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Rolandas PAKSAS", "mepid": "96694", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – p. – (DE) Mr President, colleagues, Commissioner Grandi, it is very good that you are here. Maybe we in Europe will finally be able to put all the dots on certain letters. Perhaps we will finally realise that the attachment of European countries is to help war refugees, not to open up their cities to all migrants. European society today eats the ripe fruits of the frivolity of its politicians. And in the future, they will only be more bitter if we get bogged down again in debates or deliberations. And there is really nothing to discuss the obvious. Yes, aid and humanitarian support for war refugees and those fleeing their homeland as a result of political persecution and a strict 'no' to those seeking a better life in Europe. You, Commissioner, you don't have to accommodate and probably don't accept guests in your house that you didn't invite. Why should european citizens do things differently? Let us therefore stop debating and start working to protect Europe from migrants, not to seek asylum for them, to protect the european Union's external borders, rather than for billions in buying Turkey's asylum, ensuring the security of community citizens. And the non-refugee resettlement of individual countries is a key matter for the United Nations and the European Union. Today, the causes of wars and conflicts need to be addressed.

And does anyone in this building, using women, think they're bringing people like that to Europe? I'm sorry! I'm sorry! People who say women can't laugh and provoke in public.

The EUR 3 billion, given to unemployed Europeans, not to the Turkish regime which uses them to close newspapers and reopen them when it suits them. Other than the rights of women and refugees!  Let us come to Italy. The figures, High Commissioner, say that last year, out of the 80 000 refugees who applied for political asylum in Italy – I say this to this building – only 5% were accepted as political refugees. 5%. Two-thirds of the applications were rejected. Since you talk about women, I would point out that in Italy, in January 2016, 7 000 applications for political asylum were received, of which women accounted for less than 10% – the rest, all adult and robust men – and Syrians, less than 30%. Syrian women are not seen unless someone wants to finance an uncontrolled Islamic invasion of this country and this continent. Finally, a question: how much does you Commissioner cost? How much does the UNHCR cost? How much do officials and employees cost? How many of the 7 billion budgets actually reach refugees and how many do not end up keeping people sleeping in hotels or in the office?

In addition to the requirements of this Regulation, Member States are invited to undertake to collect relevant, comparable and sufficiently detailed data on the use of antimicrobials in the treatment of animals and to send these data to the Commission in order to ensure a more prudent use of antimicrobials in the treatment of animals, thereby contributing to the reduction of the risk of antimicrobial resistance. This Regulation lays down rules for the prevention and control of animal diseases which may affect animals or humans, but there are no provisions specifically regulating animal welfare, although animal health and welfare are relevant. The Union has a well-developed animal welfare acquis covering a wide range of animal species (broilers, laying hens, pigs and calves) and activities (rearing, slaughter, transport, research, etc.).

The animals will now have more responsibility for rearing animals and using veterinary foodstuffs, which veterinarians will need to raise more awareness of.

I am convinced that this will have positive effects in preventing the illegal trade in these animals, which is in some cases a very lucrative mafia business.

Among other things, it will be essential for Member States to have contingency plans for the management of certain diseases, to introduce specific rules for vaccinations and, as a result, control measures to be taken in the event of suspected or confirmed outbreaks of pathogenic events. In the event of health emergencies due to epidemics, it is essential, as introduced by the regulation, to provide for procedures to be applied at both national and supranational level.

However, its main drawback is the existence of more than 50 dispersed pieces of legislation and several hundred implementing rules. The lack of a horizontal approach and the complex and often contradictory rules make life very difficult not only for Member States' administrations, but above all for breeders, veterinarians or traders. It is therefore welcome that the new regulation creates a harmonised legal framework in this area, which fits well with our efforts to simplify the CAP.  Another long-awaited move is to place greater emphasis on preventing disease among animals, according to the motto: prevention is better than cure. This is to m.in. to increase the responsibility of animal welfare, better monitoring and certification.

In line with this principle, the European institutions have sought to adapt existing legislation to the relevant requirements in recent years. An essential aspect of this is to ensure animal health, in particular by preventing communicable diseases. The adoption of an \"animal health law\" has become a necessity, especially when we think of wild animals that can be completely vulnerable to new type diseases. At the same time, taking antibiotics to diseased animals can weaken their immunity. The incidence of animal diseases can also affect human personnel who work with them in one way or another and amount to 20-30 million people.

It is therefore essential to support this programme in order to counteract the current decline in the consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables and dairy products, especially among children, and, at the same time, to put an end to the increase in the incidence of childhood obesity due to consumption habits oriented towards highly processed food products, which moreover often contain high doses of added sugars, salt, fats or additives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 375, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "James CARVER", "mepid": "124971", "text": "  in writing. ‒ We do want school-children to be well nourished, but we opposed this because, even if you think taxpayers should contribute, these things should not be done centrally by Brussels.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 376, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "David CASA", "mepid": "28122", "text": "  in writing. ‒ I voted in favour of the scheme as I am quite concerned at the alarming decline of the consumption of fruit, vegetables and milk products among the young people as well as the high levels of child obesity in the EU.

Guiding eating habits from childhood helps to develop greater awareness towards balanced nutrition and prevent obesity. Although the two programmes had the same aim - the promotion of healthy eating and the increase in the consumption of fruit, vegetables and milk by children , they were nevertheless regulated by different legal and financial frameworks which helped to make the administrative burden on local and national authorities excessive. The new regulation aims to streamline the administrative and financial procedures provided for in the previous ones and introduces an interesting novelty aimed at children: they will have the opportunity to come into contact with those who produce food and to deal with different types of products.

On our proposal, the European Commission should examine how EU funds to finance these programmes can be raised in the 2017 budget.

The report deals with the existing school milk and fruit programmes, which finance dairy products and fruit under the European Agricultural Policy and distribute them to schools. The report aims to extend the programmes and increase the total budget to EUR 250 million per year. As a family-friendly party, ALFA supports healthy child nutrition. However, in line with the principle of subsidiarity, ALFA sees no reason for children's nutrition programmes to be funded and regulated by the EU. According to the report, the taxpayer first pays into the EU budget, then the EU Commission decides which products can be extracted from which ingredients in order to transfer the tax revenue back to the Member States later, i.e. to finance the food programmes from EU funds. If the Länder and individual municipalities believe that such programmes are needed, they could make this much more effective without having to co-finance the EU apparatus.

Originally, financial support was to be limited to dairy products that children do not like very much, such as unflavoured milk and low-fat added sugar products.

Instead of improving children's health, there was talk that it would deteriorate, thanks to a rapid decline in milk consumption.

On the other hand, I find it shameful that some Member States cannot resolve this on their own and, by doing so, give up on children. I believe that only a single action at EU level can remedy member states' inaction. When implementing the programme in the Member States, a public consultation is needed to ensure the use of high-quality local products in the programme. It is regrettable that some Member States cannot solve this on their own and are therefore renouncing the health of children. Not only is the Hungarian Government unable to solve healthy meals for children, but shamefully it charges food, including products intended for children's meals, with a VAT rate of 27%.

The current schemes benefit nearly 30 million children per year across the EU and their funding has been increased to EUR 150 million a year (2014-2020).

I know first-hand the listlessness and attention-deficit that accompanies child hunger. The shameful removal of free school milk from British primary schools in 1971 by the Conservatives earned Margaret Thatcher the eternal nickname of ‘Thatcher the Snatcher’. She proved that Member State governments do not always have the best interests of the child at heart.

Fortunately, previous failures and the mobilization of trade unions and ports who did not want to see their economic model completely challenged simply to open up the market have broken the ambitions of the original text.

Following the mobilization of trade unions and the work of the TRAN Committee, the directive was revised in the direction of protecting social rights and workers.

The Commission's proposal will adversely affect the situation of ports in many countries, increasing bureaucracy and limiting the influence of Member States in shaping their own policies in this area. It is particularly dangerous for Polish ports to actually limit the possibility of supporting public modernisation and investment in port infrastructure, which could lead to a decrease in their competitiveness.  In western Europe, for many years ports have benefited from generous public support and thus built their strong position on the European market.

The Commission's proposal for a regulation establishes a uniform legal framework for the development, compilation and dissemination of harmonised consumer price indices (HICP) and house price indices (CCI) data at Union, national and sub-national level. The HICP is a measure of inflation used, inter alia, as valuable data that recalculate economic value (e.g. wages, rents, interest rates) in line with inflation and is therefore the basis for economic and monetary policy decision-making. It is therefore essential that these statistics are objective, impartial and comparable for all Member States and for all product categories. The current HICP Regulation was drawn up back in 1995. New developments in consumer price statistics require a review of existing rates in order to ensure the highest possible comparability for key users of the HICP. The Regulation also takes into account the innovations in EU decision-making introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon, which empowers the Commission (Eurostat) to adopt implementing measures (implementing acts) or legislative measures (delegated acts) which may amend non-essential elements of the Regulations.

Fraudulent irregularities are most common in agricultural policy, rural development and fisheries. It is therefore appropriate to establish a transparent control mechanism in these areas and to guarantee the protection of whistle-blowers. Furthermore, given that 80 % of the budget is under shared management, the European Commission should develop a system for exchanging information between the relevant authorities of the Member States.

However, it should not be forgotten that cohesion policy is more concerned with irregularities caused by administrative claims than as if they were intentional fraud.

In practice, gender mainstreaming means gender mainstreaming in the design, development, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of policies, regulatory measures and spending programmes in order to promote equality between women and men and to combat discrimination. Gender mainstreaming has a dual dimension: it requires both gender mainstreaming in different policies and addressing the issue of representation of women and men in a particular policy area. Both aspects of gender representation and gender-based content must be taken into account at all stages of policy-making. While the figures are important, it is also important to consider how the gender dimension relates to the content of policies in order to better understand how women and men can better reap the benefits they bring. Gender-based policies ensure that the needs of all citizens, women and men, are equally met. However, structural gender inequalities remain entrenched in our society. Even if the laws treat women and men equally, women still do not have equal opportunities to have resources and assets and to manage them.

A gender-sensitive Parliament can play an important role in correcting gender imbalances, facilitating equal participation for women and men and creating the conditions for the development of a policy framework for gender equality.

Is it not said that what is private, namely sexual practices, must remain in the private sector? And I don't know that these practices in any way affect a person's identity. Therefore, I find it illegitimate to base a policy on these bases. We are in favour of national unity, and these policies would pave the way for communitarianism.

The European Parliament has already taken a number of concrete measures to combat discrimination on grounds of sex.

The report contains a number of controversial proposals, including the application of parity to the functions of ep committee chairs; gender budgeting; systematically assess the gender impact of new legislative proposals or Commission policy proposals; gender mainstreaming training for all EP staff (mandatory), as well as for Members, political group staff and parliamentary assistants (where available); guidelines for gender-neutral language and training for interpretation and translation services; numerous references to the situation of LGTBIQ persons. The whole plan for gender mainstreaming is not convincing, as there is no evidence that it actually improves the situation of women.

Gender equality is key to the protection of human rights, the functioning of democracy, respect for the rule of law and economic growth, social inclusion and sustainability. The principle of gender mainstreaming and the desire to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women are already internationally accepted strategies. Nevertheless, the enforcement of equality between women and men is one of the main weaknesses listed in the European Commission's assessment of the Gender Equality Strategy for the period 2010-2015.

In 2014, half of the refugees in the world were women and girls. Historically, international conventions and national asylum policies have tended not to take into account the specific situation of women seeking asylum and the gender dimension of the refugee situation. Asylum systems were mainly viewed from a male perspective. Although a common European Asylum System (BEPS) has been established, member states' law, policies and practices remain very different and there are clear gaps in the protection of women seeking asylum in the EU. It is difficult to generate statistics on the demographic diversity of refugees trying to reach Europe, due to their nature. However, all modern research mentions that more single men than women and children come to the EU to apply for international protection. This is mainly due to gender barriers that prevent women from receiving the protection faced by women throughout their journey. The traditional unequal distribution of work means that women often remain in the country to care for children and older family members. Most of them lack, in particular, financial and administrative independence in order to leave their country. Fleeing women, who are increasingly vulnerable, are vulnerable at all stages of their journey: in their countries of origin, transit and arrival.

To mention only women as receiving ill-treatment is discrimination. The preferential treatment discussed in this report concerns only girls, but not refugee boys.

Research shows that women and girls face violence, assault, exploitation and sexual harassment at every stage of their journey, including on European soil.

It is difficult to obtain accurate statistics on the demographic diversity of refugees trying to reach Europe.

The text also recommends various measures to ensure that women's specific needs are respected throughout the asylum procedure and in reception centres, including: separate housing and sanitation facilities for men and women; female translators and interpreters; specialized trauma counselling services for women who have experienced gender-based violence; child care during selection and asylum interviews; information provided to women about their right to apply for asylum independent of their spouse's and to have legal status independent of that of their spouse; training that takes into account the specifics of women and men for staff and legal aid for women in reception centres.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1644, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Bronis ROPĖ", "mepid": "125214", "text": "  Writing. \\u2012 The current situation in the Middle East does not suggest that we will be able to successfully resolve the refugee crisis in the near future.

I was very proud to vote in favour of this report.  Women refugees and asylum seekers have specific needs that can be overlooked by an asylum policy that does not take into account their gender. To meet the needs of everyone seeking protection, our asylum laws and policies must be fully gender—sensitive throughout the process from arrival to integration. Research has shown that women and girls face violence, assault, exploitation and sexual harassment at every stage of their journey, including on European soil. Gender based violence is often aimed at the most vulnerable, this leads to women – and indeed children – who are entitled to claim asylum finding their indeterminate legal status being exploited to coerce them into transactional sex and forced into prostitution to pay for travel documents or a place in a boat or lorry.

The most shocking information was undoubtedly that these women are subjected to violence not only in the countries of origin, where their level of violence often leads to the decision to leave the country and flee to Europe, but unfortunately their scares do not end there. According to the latest reports, they also encounter violence during transit and even in the countries that make up their destination.

Many different things have happened since then so I would like to thank you for this debate and for the opportunity that this offers us all to check and double check the steps taken, the sense of direction and also the difficulties we still have ahead of us. First of all let me remind us all again what has happened in this one and a half months. First of all we had the London conference on Syria. I start with this because this was not only a pledging conference where the European Union and the Member States represented two-thirds of the contributions to support Syrians inside Syria and in the neighbouring countries, but this was also a way of showing the unity of the international community and solidarity and a sense of hope for the Syrians in their own country.  We have pledged EUR 3 billion in support for the refugees and the internally displaced people inside Syria and for the humanitarian aid. I will go back to the role of the humanitarian aid in a moment from a political and also from a security point of view, but we also prepared two packages, two compacts as we call them, one for Jordan and one for Lebanon, which comprise not only financial support, but also some measures that can support these countries in the effort of integrating Syrian refugees into the host communities, giving children education, giving young women and men job opportunities, and also making it sustainable for the communities in Jordan and in Lebanon to sustain this effort in the mid-term period.  The second thing that has happened since 19 January is that the first round of talks among Syrians took place in Geneva – almost immediately suspended because of clear problems that were coming up in the first talks that Staffan de Mistura was holding at the time – and a subsequent meeting of the International Support Group in Munich.  Here we met at length for many hours together with John Kerry, Lavrov and all the other Foreign Ministers represented there from some 20 countries, the European Union and the Arab League, all around the table, trying to check exactly whether the suspension of the talks in Geneva was due to difficulties that were impossible to overcome – not only locally, internally, nationally, among the Syrians but also in the bigger regional framework – or if it would be possible, through the International Support Group, to move forward and revitalise a process in which all of us have invested so much in the last months.  Out of this meeting in Munich we established two task forces: one on the modalities of the cessation of hostilities, co-chaired by the US and Russia, these being the two actors that needed to coordinate the most, especially in military coordination, to identify in concrete terms the maps, the groupings and the areas for the entry into force of the ceasefire or the cessation of hostilities.  And a task force on humanitarian aid, because we identified very clearly the need to have a second round of talks in Geneva, which Staffan de Mistura has now announced for tomorrow and the coming days, to make sure that these talks happen with a completely different, or very substantially different, atmosphere on the ground, rather than the one that we experienced on the previous occasion, meaning to try and reduce the gap between Syrians talking in Geneva about a very difficult political transition and process, while on the ground Syrians are dying in besieged areas and cities with no access to humanitarian aid.  So we know that delivering in an effective way humanitarian aid, food and medicines to the Syrians inside Syria would give credibility. It would create conditions for a credible process in Geneva and would also open up some channels for political discussions among different parties. We then has, as you know, the task force on cessation of hostilities producing very advanced work – the humanitarian task force as well, I will come back with details in a moment – and the adoption of UN Security Council Resolution 2268 on cessation of hostilities that started on 29 February.  Since then, I have to say – not only myself but also the UN Special Envoy Staffan de Mistura and the two Co-Chairs of the taskforce, the US and Russia – that the cessation of hostilities, the ceasefire, is substantially holding even if we are seeing several breaches throughout Syria, in different parts of Syria.  However, the overall assessment is that the ceasefire is holding and that the situation on the ground for this whole week has been significantly improved compared to all the previous weeks of the conflict. That is to say that this is probably the first time in five years of conflict that we see in many parts of Syria no major armed intervention even if, as I said, breaches are happening continuously but with an intensity and a magnitude that is definitely on a different scale from in the past. On the humanitarian task force: we have managed in these weeks to deliver aid through 180 trucks to 150 000 Syrians inside Syria in different besieged areas and we are working – the EU in particular and together with the UN – I will come back to that as I said, to reach areas further beyond the ones we have managed to reach so far.  As I said, Staffan de Mistura has announced that talks will restart from tomorrow onwards. We do not expect this to be an easy process, on the contrary, but the fact that we managed to somehow recreate, or create rather, the conditions for the talks to be taking place is definitely good. I met Riad Hijab in Paris a few days ago and we discussed at length not the conditions that anyone places on going back to Geneva but how the international community, the regional actors and the participants to the talks managed to create the conditions for the talks to be significant and substantial.  And let me say that one strong message that we, all of the European Union, together with the rest of the international community but here I talk for the European Union, are passing on united is to encourage all the parties, starting from the regime obviously but also the opposition, not only to go to Geneva and take part in the talks but also to do this in a spirit of engagement and compromise. Obviously we are also working as the European Union to support the opposition in this very difficult task of entering these difficult negotiations.  This is the first time after five years of war that we have this combination of cessation of hostilities holding overall, even if with significant breaches but holding overall, and humanitarian aid being delivered in besieged areas. So this is indeed not creating a rosy picture from one day to the next or from one week to the next, but there are some steps that are finally going in the right direction.  One of these is the coordination that I mentioned before that the US and Russia have developed, especially on the military-to-military level, a close coordination with regard to first the establishment and then the monitoring of the ceasefire, and the work to defuse tensions that could endanger this very fragile truce. This is why I believe that those who talk about a new Cold War definitely need a reality check when it comes to this level of coordination and messaging.  Now, the role of the European Union. The European Union is part of both the task forces, with different roles. On the ceasefire, on the cessation of hostilities task force we have a presence, together with other countries or organisations that are part of the international support group. We have our military experts present there and we are also working out ways in which we can contribute to monitoring the cessation of hostilities, together with other friends. On the humanitarian assistance task force our role is definitely a much bigger, relevant one, not because we are the ones who are the good ones and not the ones that get implicated in military things, but simply because in specific terms, the role of the European Union in Syria has not been – this was a political decision and I think it was right – it has not been and it is not a military player on the ground in Syria.  Some Member States are, but nonetheless, the leading role here is for the two main countries that have a military presence and activity, knowledge and control of the military activities that can be done, leading to negotiations on the establishment of cessation of hostilities. This does not mean, as I said, that we are not part also of this very crucial work with our active presence there and that, as I said, might increase in future days. On humanitarian assistance: there is here a very strong link between humanitarian aid and the political process that needs to restart. The last time we met, I remember that many of you mentioned the need for a Marshall Plan for Syria. If we consider the numbers, the money we are putting into this inside Syria, in the neighbouring countries and elsewhere, I can say that the Marshall Plan has already started in a very significant way.  The humanitarian task force in which, as I said, we have a leading role has already met four times and, as I said, has succeeded in delivering 180 trucks of aid to seven besieged areas and we reached out to more than 150 000 Syrians in cities like Madaya, Mouadimiya, al-Sham, Kafr Batna, Foua, Kafraya, Zabadani and Deir Ezzor. This is not an exhaustive list. On the contrary, we are working on further cities all over Syria that need to be reached – and could be reached – in terms of priorities in the coming days and weeks.  The plan is to deliver assistance to more than 1.7 million Syrians inside Syria during the first quarter of this year, so in the next couple of months. To provide direct help for the humanitarian deliveries and work hand in hand with the UN agencies on the ground we have reactivated our ECHO office in Damascus. Among international actors, let me say that the European Union is probably the only one that is considered trustworthy by all sides – inside Syria and in the region. Somehow we have privileged access to many of the interlocutors that then have to work on the steps that are needed to allow humanitarian aid inside the difficult-to-reach areas. Our major role on humanitarian aid gives us also a major political role to play and we are doing this. We are helping to create windows of trust between different parties in the conflict. Our role is to open wide such windows for meaningful and comprehensive negotiations towards a political transition. We have to keep in mind, even with these positive steps that have taken place in recent weeks, that a new escalation might still happen anytime. The regional situation remains very tense. Every day we see news that is extremely worrying – even this morning – and that the proxy war among regional and international powers could still turn into a direct war.  This is something we must always keep in mind all through our work, keeping the hope that moves are going forwards on the diplomatic track, on humanitarian assistance and also on the work on the cessation of hostilities and the monitoring of the ceasefire; keeping in mind the risk that this could still degenerate and go backwards if we do not show consistency and if we do not encourage enough the players on the ground – the military groups, the political actors – to engage, the regime first and foremost, to engage in meaningful political process. We have had talks. I have had direct talks in recent days with all our partners, friends, interlocutors – not friends – both inside Syria and outside Syria in the region, to pass on the same message: to engage in the political process, to allow humanitarian access to improve and to work significantly to have the cessation of hostilities hold and improve day by day. Just yesterday, we discussed this with our Turkish partners and, if you look at the communiqué that came out of the Council yesterday night, you will also find a reference to the need to work together – Turkey and the European Union – to improve humanitarian conditions in more and more areas inside Syria. This is a common commitment we discussed with the Turkish yesterday. Everyone must do their best at this time. We have opened a window – a very small one – and we have to make sure that it does not close but that it opens further on the three levels – humanitarian, military ceasefire and the political one. Let me take this opportunity here to thank Staffan de Mistura for the excellent coordination work that he is doing. We are in daily contact and the way in which we are working together with the United Nations in all these three aspects is really, I think, an example for our work also in other fields. I think we have seen that diplomacy can work in recent experiences last year. We know that Daesh can be defeated and that it can be defeated only through a process that puts an end to the war in Syria and guarantees a transition in Damascus. We know that the war inside Syria can be over and forces can merge to fight terrorism – Daesh and al-Nusra – in the country. We have today the first steps in the right direction which are the result of the very determined – I would say stubborn – work we have done, coordinated with many others, starting with the USA. After five years of war diplomacy, including European diplomacy, is starting to bring some first results that, as I said, could turn back at any single moment if we do not have all the actors pushing in the same direction with the same stubbornness we have shown in recent months. We need to continue to build on this to try to have a new Syria. Most likely the one that has been destroyed in five years of war will not come back with all its beauties, but maybe we can allow the Syrians to build their country again beyond ethnicity, religion or political creed, to be united, democratic, non—sectarian, not governed by the same men who presided over so many years of civil war, but with an inclusive governance guaranteeing all different Syrians to be part of the same country , with no space in it for Daesh and al-Nusra which have nothing to do with the history of the country and will have nothing to do with its future if we manage to work well together as we have done in recent weeks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1703, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group.

Indeed, during this long period, Syrians have not had much reason to hope. When they went out on the street five years ago, that is not what they expected. That is why, I believe, the ceasefire that came into force on 27 February is a very important element, and it is , again, I agree with you - because it allows access to humanitarian aid that the Syrian people desperately need. I remember we talked about it recently when you came before our committee. The ceasefire is also important, as it is a glimmer of hope that must be held up from this political perspective. While the ceasefire is not perfect - there are still casualties - it does exist. It is generally respected, and it is up to us to seize this opportunity and turn it into a credible political transition. \"Credible political transition\" does not mean, of course, \"immediate elections\" as Assad or Putin have suggested.

The last ten days have been the quietest for most Syrians in the last five years, but this could help to build up a momentum behind the peace talks in this war-torn country and allow the international talks set to start tomorrow to resume soon. There is no real alternative but the political solution and we need a strong political will and commitment to make it.  A political solution in Syria will allow the international community to concentrate on what is most important: fighting Daesh and all other terrorist groups and stopping them from spreading and bringing more war and suffering to the entire region. Finding a solution for Syria will allow Syrians to stay in their homes and not further risk their lives in coming to Europe or elsewhere. The participation of the moderate Syrian opposition in the international talks is essential and should be guaranteed. Therefore we condemn any actions against moderate Syrian opposition forces and against the town of Aleppo that could undermine the ceasefire and equally the international talks. The reduction in violence also allowed the dispatch of humanitarian aid and convoys to the population in need. Nevertheless, this has to continue and the Syrian Government has to cooperate and further facilitate the aid. It goes without saying that unless the talks bring results the humanitarian crisis will continue.

The cessation of hostilities is very fragile but it must be a step towards a ceasefire because the appalling violence, death, destruction, starvation and the extraordinary human suffering has gone on for far too long. The Syrian people deserve more support from us and we must strengthen our negotiating and leadership position. Had we developed a strong common and comprehensive EU strategy towards Syria earlier, we would have played a role of leadership and not merely be first in facing the consequences of inaction. The EU is most noticeable in its divisions and its struggle to offer humane shelter to those fleeing the war, many of whom are Syrians. Yes, we are key for humanitarian aid but we need more efforts to stop this suffering at its source. Meanwhile, Russia continues to help Assad and create new realities on the ground and then negotiates for humanitarian aid. Putin jumped into the vacuum using the most cynical and brutal violence of bombing hospitals, civilians and rebels that share our agenda in fighting the so-called Islamic State – or Daesh – and this kind of behaviour led by Putin’s Russia must have a price. I believe we need EU sanctions for the violence used in Syria. I have a few brief questions for the High Representative.

The truce appears, although violated several times, globally it seems to be holding up and more and more rebel factions are also negotiating. And the new climate of cooperation between Russia and the United States is certainly very positive, as is the victory of the reformists in Iran, which can further push for a negotiated solution. Perhaps the biggest problem remains the very un cooperative attitude of other allies to these factions, in particular the Turks and Saudi Arabia. In fact, in particular the Turkish agenda, I see it as very little aligned with our foreign policy, given the priority objective of having direct control over Syrian Kurdistan and which is also carried out with intense bombing, precisely against those Kurdish militias that are fighting Daesh. By the way, I still see too few serious and credible efforts to stop the illegal oil trade, which is one of the main sources of income for Daesh.  The risk of our complacency with the Turkish demands, with a new agreement for a further EUR 3 billion and further concessions, including the opening of the negotiating chapters, would not be misunderstood as a sign of weakness, with which we seem to be giving Turkey a little contract for the management of the migration crisis that we are not managing to achieve internally, perhaps passing over in silence what is happening in south-east Turkey itself and in Syrian Kurdistan.

My first point: on this International Women's Day, the UN Special Envoy, Staffan de Mistura, reminded us that Syrian women are an integral part of a lasting solution. They have the right to participate and we have a duty to ensure their participation in the peace process. In general, we know how crucial it is for the inter-Syrian dialogue to be as inclusive as possible. The second point is that if the lack of direct military involvement by the European Union has excluded us from the negotiations on the cessation of hostilities, in terms of political negotiations, that must be our strength. In the case of Syria, as in the Middle East more generally, the European Union must have the ambition to be a balancing force and we thank you, High Representative, for all your efforts in this direction.

Before last week, once again, sceptics said that the ceasefire in Syria would not hold and humanitarian assistance would remain undelivered. Thankfully, although there have been incidents to the contrary, the sceptics have been proved wrong. Civilian deaths have fallen by 90% since the truce came into force, according to media reports just this morning. Our task politically this week and in the weeks to follow is to keep trying to turn despair into hope. The High Representative should have the European Parliament’s full support to use the international collaboration that we have achieved to make tentative moves which could turn a temporary ceasefire into a permanent peace. In the remainder of this speech I apologise both to colleagues and perhaps most of all to those who are suffering in Syria, because I have to refer to a different type of sceptic: those who, I am disgusted to say, are from my own country and are seeking to exploit the tragic flow of refugees from Syria by turning it into a cynical political argument to inflame opposition to my country’s membership of the European Union. Like Boris Johnson, who referred to the sincere compassion for Syrian refugees as ‘Britain-bashers’ moral outrage’ and then repeated the deliberate myth that ‘many of them are arriving in Europe as economic migrants’. Or the leader of UKIP, who by saying that ISIS is using this route to put jihadists on European soil is giving publicity and encouragement to the very people he says he wants to deter. These people are contemptible. They will fail on Syria, just as sceptics about Syria will fail. There is genuine compassion in the European Parliament in the matter of solving this refugee crisis. They will not win. My country will remain a member of the European Union, and European efforts, rather than those of any one country on its own, are needed to respond to the humanitarian crisis that is the tragedy of Syria and to contribute to the peace which is necessary to end this conflict.

It is as if we were complaining that this glass is half-full. It is actually much less than half-full. The point is that two weeks ago it was empty. So our task is to try to build, drop by drop, a glass that is full and becomes a little bit fuller every day because every single drop is a life we save and every single life we save has a value, whether it is here in Europe, in the Aegean, inside Syria, in Lebanon or Jordan. So my job – I do not know about yours – is not to argue about whether this is perfect or not enough. My job is to try to make it better every day with what we can put at the disposal of an international community that needs to come together – finally –because five years of war are also the result of five years of international divisions and regional clashes on Syria, in Syria and around Syria.  So I really believe that the European Union’s role here is this: to try – as many of you have said – to bridge different agendas.  We have so many actors here – inside Syria and outside Syria – that have completely different agendas. We would disagree on almost everything but as our vital interests – political and, I would say, even moral – and also our interest as Europeans in security – because the longer the war lasts, the more Daesh spreads – and also in the refugee crisis – I know Frans Timmermans is having a debate on migration after me so I will not spoil his exercise and I will leave this aspect to him – but also our interest in relation to management of the flows, but first of all our humanitarian and political interest, is to try to identify the common ground among very different agendas. These are going to stay different, but maybe we can enlarge, step by step, the common ground that allows the international community and the regional players to facilitate, rather than make it impossible, for the Syrians to try to build peace instead of having five years of civil war.  So war is not over. We cannot even call it a ceasefire; we call it a cessation of hostilities and we had hours of discussion about the words here, just to let you understand how sensitive these things are. So it is clear that war is still there. It is not going to disappear next week and, as I said very clearly at the beginning, things can return to being very bad at any time if we do not continue to align all the possible elements that push in the right direction, which is a very complicated job to do every single day. So what is still there? We have a cessation of hostilities. We are trying to open the spaces we have to have more and more humanitarian access, to have more and more delivery of humanitarian aid, and to have more hope for the Syrians.  One of you said that our task is to turn despair into hope. That is true and also to try to build bridges among the different actors, identifying common grounds – that is diplomacy and that is the European spirit.  Sometimes we have difficulty in doing this inside the EU; outside we still have a little bit of credibility in doing this and I will try to keep it – the inside might help, I have to say; sometimes that is not always the case.  We are trying to build the road towards peace, political transition inside Syria and a Syrian-led and a Syrian-owned future for the country. When we say Syrian-led and Syrian-owned, we are not referring only to the Syrians who are still inside Syria, but also those who have left Syria because they also have to have a say in the future – and the present – of their country.  So indeed, as Mr Preda was saying, we need to try to stick – and to push all the actors to stick – to the roadmap that we decided together, that was endorsed by a Security Council resolution, unanimously adopted for the first time. This is the precious result of the difficult work we have managed to build.  I heard some words about the lack of unity among the Europeans here. Let me tell you very clearly: I chair and participate in five different formations of the European Council, I take part in the European Commission College every week, I am very often here in Parliament – that it is quite clear and obviously you have divisions and different views – but on this the European Union is not only united in words and in thoughts, but is also acting united. Every single week, every three to four days, we coordinate actions, messages and we coordinate our work every day in the task forces we are in. Do not portray the European Union as divided even if you do not really see the division here. There are fields where we are divided – plenty of them – but at least in the fields where we act together and we think together and we are politically on the same page, let us also try to highlight the positive that we have. We should at least do this ourselves because, if we do not do it ourselves, it is difficult for others to see this. But in this field – on our actions in Syria – we are indeed united and acting as Europe. On three things, firstly Lebanon and Jordan, I agree one hundred percent – and even more – on the need to stress not only the financial support we can give them, but also the work we can do together to increase the resilience of societies and of their systems and to work together for this. I will visit Lebanon and Jordan in a couple of weeks’ time, 10 days, and this will be one of the elements of our common work. They sit, together with us, in the International Support Group. We work extremely well together with both Jordan and Lebanon because I believe we share the same objective, namely that of trying to find a solution to the war and for the country to move forward and find peace. One other thing that was mentioned was accountability. This is something on which we are already starting to work, in particular with the NGOs that are working on the ground every single day. This is an issue which we can perhaps come back to in more detail at a later stage, either in plenary or in one of the committees. I would be glad to do so. Let me finish with one element. Some of you referred to the role of women, especially on this particular day. I like to do it especially on the other days too, but it true that 8 March is somehow a very significant day. When we say that the future of Syria has to belong to all the citizens of Syria – all the Syrians inside and outside the country – we always also refer to women. When we say that we are thinking – not only thinking but trying to build a perspective – of a secular country in Syria, we also refer to the fact that so many women in Syria have expectations of the role they can play in their country. The work that we do with the NGOs in supporting their daily work, inside and outside Syria, with the Syrians, is partially, but significantly, going towards the work of NGOs that work on empowering women.  But let me also say something that I find really sad. I am sorry to finish on a sad note. Around the table of the International Support Group for Syria, I am the only woman sitting there. This perhaps gives the European Union a special role but it tells us a lot about the state of play of the role of women in international diplomacy still in such a large part of our international community – and not only in certain parts of the world but in many parts of the world, including the European Union. To finish on a positive note, I will tell you that indeed, when women are not only at the table, but also in negotiating teams, as was the case for the Iranian deal, I think that we sometimes have better chances to build something, maybe pragmatic, maybe, as I said at the beginning, stubborn, but that at the end of the day might work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1744, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The push factors driving the flows are unlikely to be reversed in the foreseeable future. Tens of thousands of people are still fleeing war in Syria and Europe will remain attractive to those who are looking for a better life. As Europeans, we cannot and will not turn our backs on our moral and international legal obligation to provide protection for those who need it. But nor can we continue to have uncontrolled irregular flows of migrants passing swiftly north through one border after another, in fundamental contradiction with the principles of the Common European Asylum System and the Schengen rules. The crisis has exposed serious deficiencies at parts of the external borders. This, and the ‘wave-through’ policy adopted by some countries, has led several Member States to resort to reintroducing temporary internal border controls, putting into question the Schengen area of free movement and its huge benefits for our economy and our citizens. We estimate the cost of ‘non-Schengen’ to be in the range of EUR 5-18 billion a year. So we need to get our systems into order to be prepared to deal effectively with the challenge of people on the move. That means more managed and legal means of entry for those in need of protection, and quick and effective identification and return of those who have no right to be in the EU. In line with the objectives we presented on 10 February, and which were endorsed by the European Council, last week the Commission put forward a roadmap to bring the Schengen area back to normality by the end of this year. I am glad that this roadmap was fully endorsed by the Heads of State and Governments yesterday. In our roadmap, we identify three key priorities: first, Greece needs to address the serious deficiencies in its border management, with the assistance of the Commission, EU agencies and other Member States. In the meantime, we must also quickly agree on the European Border and Coast Guard to restore confidence in the effectiveness of the management of our external borders. I count on this House to play its part here. Second, the ‘wave-through’ approach has to stop now and consequentially we need to urgently step up help for Greece in dealing with those present on its territory. We are working closely with the Greek authorities and international organisations to increase the reception capacity. We have also proposed a new EU humanitarian support instrument in order to be able to help better and quicker and, finally, getting the relocation decisions really working will also help alleviate the pressure in Greece. In this regard, I welcome the fact that we have been able to accelerate the pace of relocations over the last days. Third, we need to apply the Schengen rules to ensure the future of Schengen. The roadmap makes clear that the Commission is ready, if needed, to propose a coordinated European approach for temporary internal border controls in May. Such controls would be targeted at the parts of the border where they are necessary and would be limited in time, with the aim of phasing them out by December. Let me make clear that the aim is not to sanction any Member State. It is about a concerted approach in which we can work in an orderly way whilst the underlying problems are resolved. In this crisis everything is linked to everything, and we need to work on all tracks in parallel. First of all, we need to see the numbers of arrivals into Greece come down. For this reason, it is essential that we continue to work with Turkey to fully implement the Joint Action Plan, to break the business model of the smugglers, end the tragic loss of life and make clear that the only viable way to come to Europe is through legal channels. In this regard, the European Commission stands ready to support the further work in the coming days on the basis of the principles identified by the Heads of State or Government in its statement last night. As agreed by leaders, this work will respect European and international law. In parallel, we need to see Greece return to the Dublin system, in line with the recommendation we made on 10 February. For the longer run, we need to take a fresh look at Dublin in order to make sure that we build a sustainable European Asylum system. Last but not least, I have talked about the need to ensure safe alternative routes for those in need of protection. This is particularly important in order to ensure the protection of vulnerable persons, including women and children. This was also highlighted in this morning’s debate on women refugees, and I really want to thank Parliament for raising this important issue especially on 8 March, International Women’s Day. What is essential is that we keep working on all these fronts and stick to the agreed plans. This is what Member States have committed to in successive European Council meetings. Now they need to deliver. We have a plan, and we need to show that slowly but surely this plan is starting to show results.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1750, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Monika HOHLMEIER", "mepid": "96780", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Vice-President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all, thank you very much for the overview. It is indeed the case that we are making small steps, but unfortunately the steps are still too small to actually make progress, given the scale of the problem. Although the registration data in Greece is now given in percentages, it has now increased visibly. But it is still not clear what the percentages are actually based on, because the actual figures are still not 100% clear, because we do not know how many people – as you yourself have said – actually cross the borders in concrete terms. I am also pleased that, at the EU-Turkey Summit, we have now taken another step forward in our cooperation with Turkey. I hope that action can be taken here by the middle of the month, and I would also like to thank the Commission for clearly rejecting the so-called wave-through policy. For this reason, however, I also believe it is necessary for us to tackle the issue of trafficking in human beings with an even more intensive approach. I see that both Europol and Frontex are still not sufficiently staffed, that we still do not have a full staffing of Frontex, including EASO, because the Member States do not provide the necessary experts accordingly, which I think is disgraceful. Normally, the EU should work together, not stop each other. I would like to draw attention to a particular problem and ask for your help: in 2014, 4 000 children who were sexually abused were identified. There were 8,000 children in 2015, and more children in 2016, in January only, than in the whole of 2015. In other words, the unrecognised refugee children have clearly reached the criminals.

The Commission wants to reapply Dublin to Greece – a system that has never worked and which attributes all responsibility for refugees to states with an external border alone. If the Balkan route is closed or if it remains closed, then the situation in Greece will finally become a humanitarian disaster – there can be no question of transfers back to Dublin. The other Member States must finally take responsibility.  Instead, Turkey should now take over and solve our problems. But is Turkey really a safe state, a reliable partner? The peace process with the Kurds has ended, lawyers and journalists cannot work freely, media are occupied, and after China, Turkey is the country with the most imprisoned journalists. Yes, we commend Turkey for taking in almost three million refugees and at the same time declare that we, as a continent of 500 million people, are overwhelmed with such a number – that is embarrassing! Europe is losing its value not only as a place of relative prosperity, but as a place of freedom, democracy and respect for fundamental and human rights. This affects the refugees, and it is also a fatal signal for our own citizens. The Commission and the Council must finally take political leadership and promote distribution within the EU. Yes, combating the causes of flight and smugglers, including ensuring better living conditions for refugees in third countries, remains important, but only by taking responsibility for our own responsibilities do we have a strong negotiating position and, on our part, we are a reliable and credible partner.

It is not an exciting subject, but rules are what will save us in the end. And if we do not play by the rules then why are we here in the first place? Rules and implementation do not always allow for flashy announcements, claims of big victories or headlines about vital breakthroughs, but they do matter. It was, therefore, disappointing following yesterday’s summit with Turkey to hear that once again, for the second time in 12 months during this crisis, our rule book has been torn up and thrown in the bin.  We must first make the rules we have in place work, or at least give them a chance to work and to make them work better, rather than always producing new policies based on desperation. I am supportive of a lot of the proposals the Commission has come forward with, building upon and enhancing the mechanisms we already have in place. And they will help us protect the external borders, help make returns more efficient and offer solidarity and assistance through EASO and Frontex. Vice-President Timmermans has offered us assurances today in all those respects. But nowhere in the current established rules does it say that we should take actions in contradiction to our own asylum laws, hand over huge sums of money with no proper guarantees in return and abandon the Copenhagen criteria in exchange for nothing more than a promise.  Silver-bullet solutions do not exist, relocation does not yet work and I fear any deal we make with Turkey and its current proposed form without a proper legal framework and a system of incremental payments, targets and benchmarks will create nothing more than another failure, at a time when we really need success.

We have seen the reintroduction of internal border controls despite calculations from the Bertelsmann Institute indicating that only the financial cost of the collapse of Schengen could be as high as EUR 1.4 trillion over a 10-year period. We have seen Member States engaging in a race to the bottom with regard to the reception standards for refugees, hoping that this would push them elsewhere.

In other words, joint action with the Community method to ensure a fair, reasonable division of the responsibilities for the people fleeing. What we need is for us to manage our borders together, to share the responsibility for receiving refugees together, to find ways to repatriate those that do not meet the criteria for international protection, and that we do this together under dignified conditions.

We have seen that the cost of reintroducing border controls would be EUR 5-18 billion every single year. So we need to do much more to ensure our external borders are secure and that security standards remain high. In this respect, the proposal for a European Border and Coast Guard is an essential part of the picture. We need to ensure that we do this quickly while looking at all the sovereignty implications. We also need to ensure that the commitments and the EU-Turkey joint action plan are implemented and how this can be squared together with what was agreed last night. Every Member State must follow its obligations at the external borders, and this is true also for Greece. We all appreciate the difficulties that Greece in particular is going through, and therefore it is essential that solidarity and mutual trust between Member States is the principle upon which action in this area is based. I will conclude by saying our citizens demand action from Europe. It is no longer about finding emergency responses to emergency situations. We need to move past a piecemeal approach.

But clearly it is not enough and we know that many of the Members who are engaged in this crisis, who are actually doing something in this crisis, know that the Commission has had plans for more than two years. The problem is the Council; the problem is the incoherent, often aggressive, reaction to established plans on a number of fields. So we now have two pillars to this solution: we have a set of plans from the Commission, dealing with what is most difficult from Dublin, from revising our agencies to do things that they were never expected to do so that we now have a Border Agency, we have a revamping of our Asylum Support Office – major revisions within months which we will all have to do our work on in this Chamber.  Then we have the plan on Turkey and in the few seconds that I have, I just want to caution that we do not breach international law when we deal with the Turkey plan, that we stick to our principles and international law in all that we do.

I also believe that it is important to restore internal order and to reconcile the objectives of the fulfilment of the Geneva Convention and internal order within Europe, which is currently not succeeding, and that these two objectives are reconnected. That is why it is right that a demand that we have made from Parliament for a long time should now be implemented, namely a European border control and coastguard, so that we can do justice to our possibilities here. We must see, for example, that in more than fifteen or twenty years Schengen and Dublin, we Germans have made a slender foot and said that Malta, Italy and Greece are doing this, and that we have been able to abolish our border management. We must also support this with our money, with our staff, that common border controls, that is, as a European body, be carried out in order to make progress in this way. And we must realise that this is also in the sense of a proper procedure for the refugees, and this must also be done with Turkey.

Since then, we have very little news about the establishment of the centre, which is nevertheless a concrete element of the external dimension of our migration policy. We need to use this project as a way to work with third countries, especially in Africa. I also have two points on the external dimension of our migration policy. I look at it because I think that if we do more on the causes outside, we will not have to deal with the consequences inside. First, readmission agreements: what timetable, which country?

It is therefore necessary to put an end to the possibility of migrating along the Balkan route without revulsion, and there is time for any measures to restore order at the borders.

Solidarity and concrete assistance can take many forms in their case. But the majority did not flee under international law. The larger, illegal immigrant population starts, fights and gets trapped by people smugglers in the hope of a better life, risking their own lives and that of their children – while no Member State can be obliged to accept them.

To begin with, I would like to note the call made by The President of the European Council, Donald Tusk, a few days ago to economic migrants: not come to Europe. This appeal is a breakthrough in the European Union's policy in the face of a growing migratory wave that is likely to exceed two million this year. The last two years have shown that there is no way to continue the policy of saving the world by resettling it in Europe. We cannot bear such a policy either financially or socially. The solution to the immigration crisis lies in foreign policy, in efforts to stabilise the situation in Africa and the Middle East – so that refugees have nowhere to go – and in the financial support of non-European countries that accept and rescue refugees from war-torn countries. Yesterday's summit with Turkey raises the hope that this shift from domestic policy to foreign policy will continue. At the same time, they draw a picture of the real costs we will incurred in stemming the flow of illegal immigrants. The cost is not only economic, because visa-free travel with Turkey, it is a very high price for dealing with only part of the problem. After all, Europe will continue to accept refugees, albeit legally and in a controlled manner. And this regaining of control is extremely important. Very important from a security perspective, but also important from the point of view of the effectiveness of helping refugees, because in order to help effectively, we must have real, reliable data.

Yesterday’s summit was a necessary step, although not yet conclusive since next week’s summit is even more important. Everybody has now had their responsibilities put before them and everybody will be held accountable. What should prevail, as is our common understanding in this room, is tangible solidarity on all aspects of the issues discussed by the leaders yesterday. Solidarity is the basis, the main pillar of the Commission’s proposals.  The refugee crisis is a catalyst for the destiny of the European Union and I remind you here of the myth of Sisyphus, which you all know. Now put Europe in the place of Sisyphus. Yes, Europe is carrying a heavy rock on its shoulders, but it is absolutely necessary that all Member States help the EU to carry the rock to the top of the hill, and do not allow the myth to be confirmed and see the rock rolling down again. It is our duty not to let Europe backtrack. The tendency easily to adopt a populist and simplistic rhetoric is seen in the election results in various Member States. In this way, only extremism, nationalism and xenophobia gain ground. This is detrimental to the ideal and values of Europe. Let me repeat this: we will not change our strategy and we call on everybody to uphold it. We need large-scale relocations, effective return of those who have no right to stay and, of course, secure common external borders. For this all Member States share responsibility. As Member States share the responsibility together with the Commission to safeguard Schengen, and I hope that, even if some politicians do not realise the symbolic and political value of Schengen and their duty, they will nevertheless consider the economic cost of non-Schengen. I will not repeat by views and commitments as regards Schengen; you all know them. The migratory pressure is of such scale that no Member State could face it alone and we all know this. We need immediate support for the ongoing Frontex operations and also a swift agreement on the European borders and coastguard proposal, so that none can sit and wait until things get better on their own. They will not if we do not all engage. This is why I also welcome the engagement of our partners: of the UNHCR, as I stressed this morning, and of NATO, which will help us finally stop the activities of smugglers. I remind you, we have declared a war against smugglers, with key third countries, like Turkey. Yes, we need Turkey to face this global crisis. I know that there are second thoughts, maybe some doubts, but we should never forget that Turkey is a key player in the area and a partner of Europe in our efforts. But we will not act against our own rules and this will be clarified during the coming days that will lead us to the European Council.  Return can only happen in full accordance with the European Union’s and international laws. We also need to complete our strategy. Resettlement is our immediate priority. As I had said already in my hearing, we need to build legal ways for those who need to come to Europe. Very soon, as promised, we will reveal our plans on the Dublin reform. I share your views. We need a fair burden-sharing system, including on legal migration. In a world of mobility we cannot have an EU without a proper economic migration policy, taking into account global developments, and then cooperation with third countries and, of course, coordination with the economic sector.  Last, but very important, a more coordinated policy on integration is what will complete this picture.  I would like to say to the Members of this Parliament that your interventions were very useful to me and I thank you for that and, as I always do, I am taking them very seriously into consideration in view of the upcoming developments.

It is my honour today to recommend to Parliament the approval of the new interinstitutional agreement on better law-making and its signature by the President.  The current agreement on better law-making dates back to 2003. It was concluded before the 2004 enlargement of the European Union when we still had a Union of 15 Member States, and well before the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. Parliament repeatedly called for the 2003 agreement to be renegotiated to take account of the new legislative environment created by the Treaty of Lisbon, to consolidate best practices and to bring the agreement up to date in line with the modern understanding of the better law-making agenda. So we took it as good news when, in January 2015, the then newly-elected Juncker Commission committed to presenting a proposal for a new interinstitutional agreement between the three institutions: Parliament, the Council of the European Union and the European Commission. AFCO provided its contribution to the position of the European Parliament in the negotiations, in April 2015, on the revision of the 2003 agreement. The Conference of Presidents then endorsed the President’s proposal that Mr Guy Verhofstadt would be Parliament’s lead negotiator, conducting the negotiations in close cooperation with AFCO and the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI), and also reporting to the Conference of Presidents.  Finally, in December 2016, the Conference of Presidents endorsed the new agreement. And the resolution on the conclusion of this agreement on better law-making adopted by the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, to be voted on tomorrow, expresses, in general terms, its view on the outcome of the negotiations. It also calls for the impact of the new agreement on the framework agreement and other related interinstitutional agreements to be ascertained with a view to simplifying the architecture of the numerous arrangements. It also identifies a range of issues that need further follow-up at technical or political level. It recommends the approval of the agreement and contains a mandate for AFCO to examine the extent to which amendments to or interpretations of the Rules of Procedure are necessary for the implementation of the agreement. Let me mention just some elements of particular importance for the European Parliament of the content of the new agreement. These include multiannual and annual programing; the Commission’s follow-up to Parliament’s legislative initiative requests and justifications for and consultations on envisaged withdrawals of legislative proposals; better law-making tools – which are important for a well-informed, inclusive and transparent decision-making process –  and the impact assessment issue. We agreed that the impact assessment should be comprehensive and balanced and take into account the costs of not legislating.  The independence and objectiveness of the new regulatory scrutiny vote is also an issue of particular relevance for us. The impact assessment should not, however, replace the political decision-making. Gold-plating is also an important issue, in the context of avoiding over-regulation and administrative burden for citizens, administrations and businesses, especially small and medium-sized businesses. With regard to delegated and implementing acts, we have moved forward, but Parliament expects today a swift agreement between the three institutions on the appropriate criteria for delineating delegated acts and implementing acts and a prompt alignment of basic acts via the legal framework of the Lisbon Treaty.  To conclude, having examined the content of the new interinstitutional agreement, AFCO has identified a number of issues that need further follow-up. These issues will be subject to further analysis in a joint initiative report drafted by AFCO and JURI. We trust that the new interinstitutional agreement on better law-making will be an important tool in establishing and developing a more open, more transparent relationship between the institutions with a view to delivering better law-making in the interest of the Union’s citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1834, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT", "mepid": "28176", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I am very happy to be back in this Chamber. The issue up for debate is one where we, as institutions, have come together and demonstrated our firm intent to strengthen our cooperation. I am pleased to mark this important step forward in our interinstitutional relations. With this new agreement we have jointly established a set of rules on how to ensure a better delivery for our citizens and businesses together. I will not repeat the content of the agreement, but let me mention a couple of points that demonstrate this. We will have a joint discussion on our legislative priorities and also select those that, according to the three institutions, should be at the top of the agenda for the upcoming year. And yes, at a time when the EU is perceived as fragmented, it is important to show unity, to send a signal of common purpose and to tackle the big challenges ahead of us in a joined-up way. Concerning impact assessments, we agree that EU legislation must be based on informed decisions, while acknowledging that the legislative process is political and not technocratic. As co-legislators, we have a responsibility and a duty to our citizens to ensure that when we decide we have all relevant information in front of us and we take that information into account. In this regard much emphasis has rightly been put on having a particular regard for our SMEs as they are key to fostering growth and jobs in Europe. We have committed to avoiding overregulation and administrative burdens. The Commission’s fitness and performance programme is firmly anchored within the agreement framework. This agenda should not be seen as being all about lowering standards for protection. Rather it is about thinking twice before we legislate and casting a critical eye on existing regulation. The annual burden survey that, on the suggestion of Parliament, found its way into the agreement will help us to focus our minds on this matter. It will be a common platform for a discussion on how we can better ensure that we have legislation fit for purpose but without unnecessary burdens being put on citizens, businesses and administrations. We have also agreed to enhance the transparency of our work for citizens, and here I would like to highlight that we will have a joint database on the state of play of legislative files. This may sound to some of you like a technical issue, although it is quite important. People have to be able to understand how we work, so more active joint communication is needed. Then – and this is highly significant – Parliament and Council have agreed on a number of points where we, as co-legislators, can strengthen our cooperation, such as being better at ensuring an efficient process, while safeguarding the quality of legislation and respecting each institution’s prerogatives, such as working closer together at an early stage to better understand each other’s points of view and thereby , hopefully, facilitating negotiations. In this context, I would like to express my appreciation for the constructive approach of both Parliament and the Commission in establishing measures to instil greater confidence in Member States in the use of delegated acts. I am confident that this agreement will contribute to ensuring a framework and an atmosphere for negotiations that are conducive to finding constructive solutions to our common problems. We are all aware that the agreement is the result of a compromise, and not all issues were settled to the full satisfaction of each institution. Some points were hard fought, touching on sensitive issues and the balance between institutions. However, I believe that the deal represents a fair balance. The Council has welcomed the agreement reached and next week, on 15 March, the General Affairs Council will formally adopt the agreement. We then have to turn swiftly to implementation. We have to seize the momentum to put all the good words into practice, to make a real difference in how we deliver to our citizens and businesses. The Presidency has therefore placed implementation and follow-up high on the agenda of the Council. Already next week we will kick off by deciding on how the Council will organise its work in relation to the Commission’s annual work programme, also paving the way for the three-way talks on the joint annual priorities. We are only at the start of our discussion within the Council on implementation, but the Presidency in particular intends to look at how the Council deals with impact assessments and how to take forward the overall ‘better regulation’ package presented by the European Commission. And yes, the Presidency also intends to put transparency on the agenda. In closing, I would like to underline that the Presidency and the Council will of course continue to work in close cooperation with both Parliament and Commission on ensuring an effective application and implementation of this important agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 1835, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, when we reached an agreement on this in December, I was in two minds about it. I was happy that we had an agreement which takes us quite a number of steps forward, but I would have liked to see a more ambitious agreement in many areas. But realism took over and it was impossible to convince people to go the extra mile, so we settled for an agreement that is still much better than what we had before. So for me the glass is still half full with this agreement.  Why is it important? Because we needed to look at the whole policy cycle. We needed to review everything we – the three institutions directly involved – do when we legislate. All three institutions were unhappy with the status quo, so we wanted to bring improvements. Let me a mention a few substantial and meaningful, and let me repeat that, from our three different perspectives, none of us got a hundred percent of what we wanted. On implementing acts and delegated acts, the proposed approach should facilitate future discussions between the co-legislators and unblock the current impasse on many individual files. The Commission will also provide greater transparency by allowing stakeholders to see the text of delegated acts and implementing acts before they are adopted. On annual and multiannual programming, the interinstitutional agreement provides for intensive collaboration between the institutions in setting priorities through annual and multiannual programming and on identifying the priority files for the legislative procedure. On regulatory fitness, each new act will set out how the legislation will be monitored and evaluated in the future so that we can check whether it is working as planned. The Commission’s regulatory fitness programme will also play a central role in simplifying the body of existing legislation and reducing unnecessary regulatory burdens, but without weakening any of our important social and environmental goals. One of the biggest fears when we started this exercise was that this was just cutting red tape at the expense of our standards. This is not what we are doing. We are maintaining, and even improving, our standards, while still cutting red tape. On transparency, in some cases working jointly across the institutions to build common IT platforms for delegated acts – and later perhaps for the codecision procedure – will help open up decision-making to public scrutiny. It is important to remember that the framework agreement between Parliament and the Commission continues to apply in full, and the Commission remains committed to it as the bedrock of the cooperation between our two institutions.  This is a balanced outcome. I repeat that, although not all my ambitions were realised, it is balanced for the institutions. I hope that Parliament can support the outcome agreed by its negotiators, as this is good for the public and for business. I would like to thank Mrs Hübner very much for her outstanding report on this. We have a strong political message from the three institutions that they take seriously better regulation and the concerns of small businesses and the man and woman in the street – how can I say ‘man in the street’ on 8 March? – about unnecessary regulation. We have support for better regulation from all the institutions as a means to deliver societal objectives in the most efficient way.  If Parliament approves the new agreement, the Commission is ready to start work immediately with Parliament and Council to ensure its timely and effective implementation so that together we can start delivering concretely for our citizens and our businesses. In particular, the Commission can start to deliver on its commitments on the alignment of existing empowerments with the Lisbon Treaty, and we can work together to deliver the new register for delegated acts, which is something Parliament also wants.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1836, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Esteban GONZÁLEZ PONS", "mepid": "125027", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, I would first like to congratulate Mr Timmermans on this very important initiative he has carried out since the Commission. I would also like to congratulate Mrs Hubner on the report, which is a report, I think, difficult to carry because it demanded a lot of consensus and which she has brought to fruition. And to congratulate my colleague Markus Pieper because he has made an effort to ensure that small and medium-sized enterprises are well defended in the interinstitutional agreement and, although we are ultimately not entirely satisfied, we have a second report which this Parliament will be working on to clarify those points where we believe that small and medium-sized enterprises should have been better defended by this agreement. During the negotiations, many popular group priorities have been addressed and that is why we are pleased: with regard to impact assessments, which are indispensable tools for achieving quality legislation and which will reduce the bureaucratic burden on enterprises, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises; with regard to the subsidiarity examination, which will allow us to legislate only where and when necessary; delegated acts, and I am glad of the words I have just heard from Mr Timmermans, because it is time for parliament's difficulties in almost every negotiation of the last decade to be resolved.

We are, of course, in favour of an improved and better system for legislators to know the impact of what they are doing and the potential costs that they may place on others. That is essential. But, we have always said that this must be a comprehensive assessment. It is not just about cutting costs to small and medium-sized enterprises, important as that is. It is also about the costs and burdens of other kinds. Not just of legislating, but potentially of the cost of not legislating, costs on the consumer, costs on public health and therefore on public budgets, costs to the environment, costs to the way our competition policies work. All this must be taken into account. Impact assessment must be comprehensive; a real cost-benefit analysis, in other words. We must also bear in mind that we are talking about legislating at the European level. Now, when we get it right, when we bring in common rules for our common market we are replacing 28 divergent and contradictory sets of national rules. In other words we are simplifying things for businesses, we are cutting red tape. That must be part of the occasion. And our third concern was that the procedure for impact assessments must, of course, be advisory. There is no right of veto for an appointed official in a legislative procedure. As elected representatives we must have the final say. Imagine if, 30 years ago, since this is International Women’s Day, an impact assessment had said: ‘oh, equal pay for equal work, that will cost businesses, that will cost the exchequer, no we had better not do that.’ Of course, we would have overridden that advice and taken the political decision to legislate anyway. Since the agreement meets our concerns in these respects my Group will fully support it. We also support the other things in it – on programming, transparency, impact assessments – very good. We look forward to approving it and to working for the further implementation of this important agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 1838, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Anthea McINTYRE", "mepid": "111011", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, I welcome this agreement as a step in the right direction; but like the Commissioner, I wish it had been more ambitious.  Reform in the European Union must be an ongoing process and it cannot stop with this interinstitutional agreement. Cutting administrative burdens, cutting red tape, especially for small businesses, is absolutely vital for our competitiveness in the global economy. My Group established three key priorities for the IIA: the SME and competitiveness tests, burden reduction targets and the independence of the regulatory scrutiny board.  On the last priority, our report sees the establishment of the scrutiny board as a welcome first step in achieving the independence thereof. On the first two, I am very pleased that the IIA reflects the text of the Council conclusions from February, specifically the burden reduction target. This was a key part of my Prime Minister's negotiations. Simplifying regulation and setting targets for cutting red tape will be good for the whole EU, and that is just what he made clear: we should make things better for the whole of Europe, not just the UK.  So there are some important things in this agreement, including impact assessments on substantive amendments, sunset and review clauses and a strong commitment to regulatory simplification. I am particularly pleased to see the commitment to undertake an annual burden survey to review the efforts to simplify legislation, to avoid overregulation and to look at the stock of existing EU law.

Legislating is not an easy job, but legislating for all 500 million Europeans in twenty-eight countries is certainly very difficult. Beyond the principle of subsidiarity, the principle of proportionality by which we govern, there is the objective that the legislation is of quality and that it is not impossible to understand and implement. This agreement has to do in particular with the understanding of the rules, with better collaboration between co-legislators, with the applicability of the legislation that we are going to pass, with the anticipation of the impact, on the one hand, and the cost of non-Europe on legislation, and with the account of SMEs, which are indeed eternal forgotten in many european regulations and policies. It is not easy to co-register, because the institutions have technically very sophisticated gears, and the truth is that many of the European citizens sometimes see us as if we are installed in a distant galaxy. For all of the above, this Parliament feels the need — and has collaborated to do so — to improve that participation and trust that we must earn from the citizens. With this agreement, Parliament has lowered some of the barriers we have identified and successfully negotiated a broader and balanced approach to better regulation.  In this context, these good results must be achieved, Mr Timmermans, with regard to these impact assessments, the transparency and implementation of Union legislation, as well as the reduction of bureaucratic requirements, which must allow for greater flexibility, and the fight against deregulation, which is not the same as over-legislating. Legislate the right, no more, no less, but legislate, moreover, well. However, there has been no lack of pressure from those who insist on national nearsightedness or blind populism. Well, in the face of that too, I believe that we have reached a pragmatic, realistic agreement. And, with this aim of giveing the European Union the strongest possible legal framework, we will work.

Trade unions expressing the needs of workers seem to be sidelined. At the same time, questions arise as to whether Parliament's voice is indeed being strengthened in the legislative process or whether it is the Commission which is mainly strengthened by this agreement. As Europe experiences intense reflection on its future, we should have changed its focus and perceptions and focused on the problems of the many, not the interests of the few.

It is the 27 million unemployed, the refugees who cannot be welcomed with dignity and the problems facing this Europe that are not administrative.

Legislation – and I think that has been clear from the debate so far – has to avoid the extremes of under-regulation and over-regulation. To that end, while legislation is being formulated there must be wide-ranging consultation with all stakeholders, not just with the ones that have the most effective lobbying capacity. Some stakeholders are smaller, but their interests too must be recognised. SMEs come to mind here, and not just mine. All law-making involves a political decision which is then converted into a legal outcome. This is where impact assessment and attention to implementing and delegated legislation assumes importance.

I would not say what I am going to say now if he were present, but I think that, likewise his colleagues and partners, he did a very good job and I think that we have an agreement that we can implement today, and we can implement it so that the glass is, as I say, full.

First of all, I fail to understand how anyone can say that doing something for SMEs is neo-liberal policy. I just do not understand it. If we can help SMEs across the European Union so that people who run small businesses can run their business instead of being engaged in endless hours of administration, they can hire extra people – how is that neoliberal? If we are to create more jobs in this European Union, we will have to start with SMEs. That is the best bet we have and this programme, this agreement, gives us extra concentration on what it means for SMEs. Why? Because they cannot defend themselves as well as big corporations can in the Brussels bubble. That is why I strongly believe we should concentrate on helping SMEs be better at what they do. My second point is this: Mr Durand of the Greens got terribly excited – I was a bit afraid he might do himself some harm – but he was angry because we were lowering social standards and lowering environmental standards. I have challenged his group time and again to give me three examples of where this Commission has come up with proposals that led to lower social or environmental standards. Two would be fine. Even one. Nothing. So before he gets terribly excited he should perhaps talk to other members of his Group so that we know what we are talking about. Finally, let me repeat very clearly that to me this is the beginning of a process. The way we implement this will show whether we really are capable of better law-making or not. It is not just about having less regulation at European level. It is also, in a rational way – a socially, environmentally and economically sustainable way – about removing too much red tape because there are 28 different regulations, and trying to find a common European solution. That also is better regulation. So I am proud of the fact that we have got this agreement. I will repeat once again that I would have loved to go beyond what we have achieved, but still this represents the consensus between three institutions and different political angles to this. I believe it is the basis for truly better regulation, completely controlled by the outside world, because we are going to be much more transparent, engaging others much more. Especially by using the expertise in the REFIT platform, we will be able to create momentum so that in future our SMEs in particular will not be overburdened by unnecessary regulation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1868, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Jeanine HENNIS-PLASSCHAERT", "mepid": "28176", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, many Members have spoken about the importance of the impact assessments and yes, I am convinced that the impact assessment will strengthen the decision-making process in the Council and the European Parliament. I am also convinced that new impact assessments will allow the institutions to better assess the implication of legislation at a very early stage. It is important to note, though, that impact assessments will not or should not limit the roles of the co-legislators, whether in Parliament or in the Council. It will and should only serve as a very helpful tool so yes, I agree very much with you, Mr Howitt, on impact assessments. These are advisory because ultimately it is us, the co-legislators, who will take a political decision. But clearly, the better the impact assessment is, the more informed the political decision will be. Mr Pieper mentioned the issue of gold-plating. The current text in my view is clear and reflects the roles and responsibilities of the institutions and the Member States in a process of implementation and transposition of Union legislation. It is important that we all have a very clear picture about what aspects of national legislation are of a European nature and what aspects are the result of national considerations. It is clearly indicated in the agreement. With the current wording we were able to listen to the wishes of the European Parliament and the positions held by national parliaments with their specific role in the implementation process. I know that Mr Pieper wanted to go further when it comes to gold-plating, I understand, but I do hope that he will accept that a glass half-full, as the First Vice-President said, can still be enjoyable to drink. Ms Adinolfi and several others mentioned the importance of increased transparency. I stressed this as well earlier, and I would like to stress again that under the Netherlands Presidency we will also make a start with two important provisions in the agreement: the register for delegated acts and the database on the state of play of legislative files. I do hope that the European Parliament and the Commission will undertake similar steps thereby making it possible to strengthen transparency of the Union as a whole. On the SMEs I think the First Vice-President of the European Commission was very clear about that and yes, I do agree with Mrs Vicky Ford. She is right: we need to deliver on our promises, and I am convinced that we will act accordingly.

We can indeed, as you were trying to say, go beyond what is on the paper and the Parliament is committed to it. We have heard that the Council is starting the debate on implementation and will ensure the implementation of the agreement in close cooperation with the Parliament and with the Commission.

In the agreement, steps have been taken to improve the mutual exchange of views and information between the Council and the European Parliament. We need to develop this cooperation further.

I can tell you that the ink on the proposal is, almost literally, not dry yet. Free movement for workers and the free provision of services are two of the four fundamental freedoms of our internal market. Since I took office, I have hardly ever heard these fundamental freedoms questioned, but I have often heard concerns on four specific aspects: first the impact of mobility on sending and receiving countries; second, the actual enforcement of existing rules; third, specific imbalances perceived as unfair; and, fourth, the need to ensure a level playing field within the single market. I am deeply convinced that we should not ignore these concerns, but address them. What should be the key building blocks of our response? First, our response should not be to shy away from labour mobility. We must promote the values of free movement that the European Union stands for and underline the medium and long-term benefits for our citizens, labour markets and our societies. Second, we need rules that are clear, fair and enforced on the ground. This is not always the case today. There is room for improvement. In my opinion, we now have four instruments in place that already offer national authorities more and better tools to make sure that free movement is fair and well managed. We have EURES, we have the platform to fight undeclared work, we have the enforcement directive on free movement of workers, and we have the enforcement directive on posting of workers. All these four instruments should be implemented swiftly. My services are providing active assistance to Member States but, once the transposition deadlines for the directives have expired in June, the Commission will also not hesitate to take enforcement measures if needed. A fair European labour market will only exist if the measures that we have adopted are also implemented. Implementing the rules we have in place is, of course, one part of the answer. Going further, we also need to improve, update and strengthen rules where needed. With this objective in mind, we finalised the preparation of a labour mobility package at the end of last year but, as you know, we decided to postpone its adoption until after the European Council where the UK issue was to be settled in order to avoid any interference with ongoing political discussions. With the UK deal on the table now, it is clear that we cannot proceed with our proposal to amend the social security coordination rules in Europe until we know the outcome of the UK referendum, but there is another aspect of fair labour mobility, posting, on which we could proceed. The Commission has today adopted the legislative proposal that we announced in our work programme 2016. I want to be very clear about my political view. We need more posting in Europe, not less. There are now about 1.9 million postings per year, a steep increase but still less than 1% of our workforce. There is potential for more and the Commission will continue to push for removing barriers to cross-border service provision, as stated in our internal market strategy. But, whilst pushing for more cross-border service provision and for more posting, we should also make sure that the system is organised in a fair way – fair for workers and fair for businesses. Much has been said and written about the articulation between internal market rules and social rules in Europe. For some, market rules should prevail and for others, social protection, but the truth is that the essence of the European social model is that both can and should go hand in hand. That was the core objective of the 1996 Posting of Workers Directive and it remains the objective now: to promote cross-border services, whilst guaranteeing worker protection and a level playing field between local and cross-border service providers. In the 20 years that have passed since the adoption of the 1996 directive, the European labour market has of course changed. With 28 Member States the divergences in wage levels and wage systems between Member States have significantly increased. Instead of convergence we see more divergence, and this has an impact on posting. The gap in minimum wages has increased from a 1:3 ratio in 1996 to a 1:10 ratio today. The differences in the constituent elements of remuneration in each country have also increased. Is a worker entitled to a 13th-month bonus, a Christmas premium, bad weather or travelling time compensation? The current posting rules do not provide a clear answer to this and this gives rise to uncertainty and disputes on a daily basis. That is bad for the posted workers, who may find it difficult to have their rights respected. It is also bad for posting firms as it increases transaction costs, and some even give up on the idea of posting because it is simply too complicated. In a highly competitive internal market, competition is based on quality, productivity and innovation. Labour costs are only one element, but competition based solely on wages is not in the interest of workers or business, nor of the competitiveness of Europe in a globalised economy. Whilst the construction sector still accounts for around 43% of postings, postings have spread to other sectors as well. Journalists, bankers, health care providers and others are posted today. They too should be protected, which under the current directive is not always guaranteed. Finally, we see growing trends of outsourcing and sub-contracting in the labour market. While sub-contracting continues to make a lot of sense when it gives access to more specialised skills and more efficiency, it creates unfairness and market distortions when sub-contracting firms are not subject to the same rules on remuneration. When undercutting local wage norms is the main reason for outsourcing, it leads to unfairness, segmentation of the labour market and downward, instead of upward, convergence. That is not the internal market we want and it is not the internal market we promised our citizens. It is clear that we need a targeted revision of the 1996 Posting Directive to address those issues and to update the rules to today’s context. I know many of you recall the difficult discussions on the Enforcement Directive. I remember those as well, as a Member of this Parliament at that time, but I sincerely believe that, this time too, we can come to an agreement. Since my first day in office, I have listened very carefully to representatives of various political groups, Member States and stakeholders, and I have noted the following requests in particular: better protection for posted workers, a level playing field between domestic and cross-border service providers, the need for more transparency and more legal certainty, respect for the principles of proportionality and non-discrimination , and also of course respect for the subsidiarity principle and for national wage-setting systems. The proposal that the Commission adopted today addresses those concerns in a balanced way. We propose targeted adjustments to the provisions on remuneration, building on recent judgments of the Court of Justice, and with full respect for specificities and national circumstances. It will no longer be the minimum rate of pay only, but all provisions on remuneration in the host country that will apply to posting. We will align the directive with the rules on social security so that both for social security purposes and for labour law purposes workers posted for longer than 24 months will be considered as integrated in the labour market of the host country, and we will better align the Posting of Workers Directive with the directive on temporary agency work: rules applicable to local workers must be applied to posted workers as well. I hope you will study our proposal – the official one, not the unofficial ones which I have seen commented on in the press in recent days. I hope you will study our proposal with an open mind and with a constructive approach. As you know, I am ready to come back to Parliament and discuss it at any time. The Commission will continue to work constructively with the co-legislators and, of course, also with Parliament, with pleasure and with the aim of coming to a good agreement.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 1877, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "David CASA", "mepid": "28122", "text": "   – nixtieq nibda dan id-diskors tiegħi billi nirringrazzja flower-gumssar marianne thyssen għaliex naħseb irrid nirringrazzjaha għall-kuraġġ illi kellha biexġ tera' tibda diskusjoni dwar din id-direttiva, illi ma kinitx direttiva perfetta u naturalment kellna aspetti – anki aħna bħna partit Popolari – li frog naħsbu li għandhom bżonn jiġu rranġati.

Mrs Thyssen, I am very pleased that the Commission has realised that the Enforcement Directive alone is not enough, but that it is really necessary to approach the actual directive. It was only under pressure from the trade unions and we Social Democrats that last week's draft was improved at the weekend. The Commission could have saved itself this if it had actually taken the social dialogue seriously. The principle of equal pay for equal work in the same place must apply to everyone, including posted workers. But this must also apply to all types of collective agreements. It must also be clear that minimum standards must not be interpreted as maximum standards, and that Member States must be able to continue to lay down stricter rules to protect workers. We welcome the fact that, for the first time, a limit on the duration of posting is to be established. However, 24 months is unrealistic. If we look at the construction industry, for example, half of the posted construction workers work there for less than half a year. A limit of six months must be the objective in order to actually improve the situation. In addition, the real problems must be addressed: chain postings, endless subcontractor chains without clear responsibility, letterbox companies, bogus self-employment, posting by temporary employment agencies, workers being bruised for wages and social benefits, distortion of competition through lower social security contributions. These points must be at the heart of the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive and the announced revision of the coordination of social security systems.

After all, the same issue has already been addressed by the previous regulation, which is an acceptable and balanced compromise between the principle of the freedom to provide services and the need to ensure adequate protection for workers, including minimum wage rules. So I ask at the outset: What objective does the Commission see in revising the legal framework at a time when the time for implementing the rules in force has not even passed and their results are not known? Is such an approach not contrary to the principles of better regulation which the Commission has undertaken to comply with?  The Commission expects the new revision to create a better competitive environment and ensure better pay conditions. But will this be true across Europe? Is the Commission not worried about reducing the competitiveness of enterprises from economically less developed Member States and, by extension, jeopardising the jobs of posted workers? Has the Commission taken into account the real economy in the Member States, including different pay levels? I am afraid that the new proposal will lead to a dispute between the Member States and once again increase barriers to labour mobility. The new concept of rules is not legally defined at EU or Member State level and will have a negative impact on the cross-border business of SMEs, which are the backbone of the European economy.

These issues should be treated with special care and care by us. I wonder, however, why the Commission has so hastily decided to revise the Posting of Workers Directive. Less than two years ago, after lengthy and difficult negotiations, all political groups and Member States adopted an implementation directive which, together with the current rules on posting, provides an appropriate compromise between worker protection and the freedom to provide services. Personally, I regret that the Commission did not wait for the implementation of the implementation directive and has missed the position of many Member States and the social partners on this issue.  In the Commission's view, a change in the rules on posting is necessary in order to achieve greater social cohesion in the Union and to ensure fair conditions of competition for companies. However, when it comes to the need to equate the burden of labour costs, the Commission forgets that companies that delegate employees bear a number of costs that local companies do not have to cover. In this situation, we may face discrimination against foreign actors, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, which can effectively undermine the competitiveness of the single market. Let us remember that posted workers are the most likely to fill the shortfall in local labour markets, and the bulk of postings – more than 60% – are posted between workers of the Western European Union. Creating barriers to the provision of services can lead to a reduction in posting, an increase in the grey economy – we already have such cases – and, consequently, less social cohesion.

Article 45 guarantees equal treatment for seasonal and temporary agency workers, for fixed and part-time workers and for men and women, but not for posted workers. In some sectors, such as construction for example, there are wage gaps of 30% and more between local and posted workers, and in countries where posted workers make up a reasonable amount of that sector, posting can and does exercise a downward trend on wages.

I would warn, however, that we should be lump-sum-based, but I would say that we must look at the data and the facts. Not every posted worker in Europe is a problem. It is often discussed that there is only the posting of low-wage countries to high-wage countries and that wage dumping will then occur. But that is not the case everywhere. We have about 50 to 60% of the dispatches where this is the case. The other part, however, goes from high-wage to low-wage countries. With regard to workers where there are problems, of course that is the case, and we are abusing them, for example in the construction industry or in slaughterhouses or in the service sector, and we must counteract this. We are happy to do so as we mentioned in the PPE social paper: a targeted revision – I have no problem with that. What is important afterwards is the content that is in it. A second issue that I would like to raise again: the issue of equal pay for equal work in the same place of work. It sounds great, it sounds very good.

The proposal is in response to two of the major priorities I have in this area. First of all, the duration of posting. Secondment is by definition temporary and should also be regulated as such. Exactly how long the secondment can and will take can and will still be debated in this House, but the proposal to limit the duration is very good. The same applies to the proposals for the remuneration of posted workers. This can be clearer, more transparent, better for the posted worker and better for the labour market, and a number of good proposals have been made there too.

As I expected, it is too much for one, for the other too little; for one we come up with proposals too quickly and for the other we do not come forward with proposals quickly enough. What I remember above all – and I am very positive and optimistic about this – is that I have heard a great deal of willingness among Members of Parliament, among many people, to listen to each other, to work together and to see how we can bring this exercise to a good conclusion. I have seen this in many groups, and I very much appreciate it.  I would like to say this: why are we now coming up with this proposal and why are we not waiting for the enforcement directive that we adopted in 2014 to be transposed? The reason is very clear: the enforcement directive has been put in place to ensure that the Member States have more instruments in their hands and would work better together to make the rules that are in place better apply. The Enforcement Directive is there to combat fraud and abuse and to ensure that the rules are ultimately better enforced. To do this, the Member States needed more instruments, and they got them through that enforcement directive. That's a good piece of legislation. We encourage the Member States to implement this directive in a timely and qualitative manner. We expect them to do that by June 18, because that's the limit date.  But that's not enough. We must also have the courage to look at the rules themselves, at the material rules we apply. We have seen that there are shortcomings there too, and that is why this Commission promised you when it took office that we would do the same and that we would move towards a focused review, focusing on the principle of equal pay for equal work. That is why we must act now and not wait for this enforcement directive to be implemented and for it to be evaluated. In the meantime, we cannot allow time to continue without looking at the basic rules themselves. I believe that we still have plenty of time and, above all, sufficient opportunity to discuss the technical details, but I would like to give a brief answer on a few things. The operation of the A1 form, which shows that people who pay social security are subject to social security in their country of origin. The questioner has since left, but I can assure you that with the social security coordination proposals we will ensure that that A1 form becomes a useful and reliable document. I would also like to point out - because this question has been asked by several people - that we are moving towards maximum equality, equal pay for equal work in the same place and that we also want to give maximum effect to the collective agreements, but we must do so within the legislative framework in which we work. We go so far as to include in this directive the collective agreements concluded at the level of a separate company in some circumstances – and I invite you to read the texts very thoroughly. We must, of course, respect the principle of non-discrimination, and that limits the scope that we can give to it. But please read the proposal very thoroughly and you will see that we are giving maximum effect to the collective agreements, out of respect also for the social partners. What I would like to emphasise, then, is what I said in the explanatory statement to this proposal. We are committed to promoting mobility in Europe. In order to do that, we need clear and fair rules that can be enforced and that are actually observed in practice. But what we also need is for the rules to be accepted by the citizens as being fair. They must not only be fair, they must also be socially accepted. This is what inspires us in this proposal. I look forward to the debate that we are going to have together, that we are also going to have a debate with the various Member States of the European Union, and after hearing what goodwill is here in this European Parliament, I am convinced that we can find solutions together here too.

Because this competition also lies in a difference in cost. In France, even if their wages are the same, a Romanian or Polish seconded worker will always cost less than a French or immigrant worker. And this will always give foreign companies a competitive advantage over their French competitors to win contracts, such as the organization of the PS summer universities or COP21, for example. It would also mean limiting the duration of the secondment to two years, which is already enormous, with the automatic transformation of the seconded worker into an immigrant worker after this period.

The three largest emitting countries are PL (228 thousand), DE (227 thousand) and FR (144 thousand). Any legislation in the field of social and employment should only be balanced, well-founded and proportionate. A further amendment to the amendment to the legislation adopted only a year and a half ago, the deadline for its implementation in the Member States expires only this summer, is completely unreasonable and there is no adequate comprehensive data and impact assessment of the functioning of the legislation.  Let's look at the facts. Posted workers account for less than half (0.3) % of the EU labour market, so we cannot talk about a significant group. The mobility of the European workforce is much smaller than that of goods or services, but it is also far below the mobility of the American or Japanese workforce. This is a competitive disadvantage for Europe. Furthermore, the EU is gradually losing its competitive advantage at international level.

The European Commission today presented its proposal to revise the rules governing the secondment of workers within the Union. It was time, when we know that the current directive has reached the canonical age of 20 years.  While the 1996 directive was designed to protect employees, it was largely diverted from its objective, paving the way for widespread social and fiscal competition between workers, businesses and social protection systems.  At first glance, several proposals in this project are interesting: seconded workers should be entitled to the same pay conditions as their colleagues working for the same company with a contract from the host country.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The social situation in Europe urgently needs a triple-A social rating. This has undoubtedly and obviously also reached the Commission. Everyone knows that we are still insisting on very high unemployment in Europe, albeit slightly, but it is only the officially registered one. We have a totally unacceptable rate of youth unemployment, and not only in the so-called crisis states. We have a situation where poverty in Europe reaches such a scale that a quarter of the European population lives at or below the OECD poverty line. We sometimes cheer about new jobs being created, but it is essentially precarious jobs that are created where people are poor in work. All this, it seems, the Commission has now grasped and is turning an initiative into a social triple-A. In October 2014, Jean-Claude Juncker ambitiously announced this project in a speech to the EP. Even the Five Presidents' Report on the completion of the European Economic and Monetary Union aims to strengthen the focus on employment and social affairs. EPSCO 2015 defined the conclusion of a vision for a social triple-A rating for Europe. I quote: 'Social policy should use its full potential and address social and employment challenges for achieving the common social and employment objectives in the Europe 2020 strategy'. These are all words. I recognise – also for the Commission, there is, I believe, no discussion – for the social issue in Europe, there is no simple and no general solution. But since the first announcement, the Commission has not delivered. No concrete and structured information about the progress of a social triple-A. There is now a communication from the Commission, but, Commissioner Thyssen, I am not getting much smarter from today's structured information. I am missing too much, there are generalities that any of us in this Parliament could sign. But there is no clear announcement as to what is happening. Firstly, how does the Commission define a social triple-A for Europe? Secondly, what are the specific details about the concept, the components and the objectives? Thirdly, what are the existing and, above all, what are new mechanisms, procedures and indicators and measurable steps, both inside and outside the European semester, for achieving these objectives? Fourthly, how will the instruments be used? Fifthly, what is the Commission's detailed timetable for a social triple-A? Sixthly, how to promote better upward social convergence based on common high-level standards? These are all questions that arise. But I am not yet at the end of my committee's questionnaire. What reforms and legislation does the Commission intend to promote at European and national level so that we can achieve greater social convergence? Eighthly, how should progress in this direction be reviewed? Finally, how does the Commission intend to install a social triple-A rating for the whole of the EU and not just for economic and monetary union? Do we not want to create a core Europe and a peripheral Europe, a two-speed Europe in the social sphere? These are questions that arise. Finally, I would like to make it clear that I believe that the social situation is the key issue, the absolutely crucial key issue, for a common Europe based on solidarity. That is why we do not have time until March 2017, we do not have the time to wait for a White Paper. There is now an urgent need for clear steps towards a stronger social Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 1926, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, since its first day in office, a key goal of this Commission has been to create a Europe worthy of a social triple—A rating. For me there is no doubt that it is an ambition – indeed, a commitment – that the economic strengthening of our Union goes hand in hand with improving people’s lives. This is the core of the European social model and a vital component of our social market economy. In my view, a triple—A social Europe requires fair and balanced growth that leads to the creation of decent quality jobs, as well as chances and protection for all throughout their life cycle. The Commission has put fairness at the core of our agenda and I am convinced that it is only by ensuring that social considerations are better integrated in all European policy areas that we will truly achieve a social Europe. The Commission has already taken concrete steps to make sure Europe deserves a triple—A rating. Within the European Semester we have deepened the analysis of employment and social performance and we have strengthened the role of social partners at European and national level. We have done a social impact assessment in parallel with the negotiations of the new support programme for Greece. We have proposed a recommendation to the Member States on the reintegration of the long-term unemployed into the labour market, which was adopted in February. We proposed – and the Parliament and the Council quickly accepted – to increase the pre-finance for the Youth Employment Initiative from one percent to 30 percent, which represented an advance payment of around EUR 1 billion. This has allowed for the projects under the Youth Employment Initiative to really take off. We adopted the proposal for the Accessibility Act, which will give persons with disabilities more opportunities and choices in their everyday life. The newly established European Platform against Undeclared Work will help to combat undeclared work throughout the Union and contribute to better working conditions in the EU. A new EURES regulation will make it easier for jobseekers to expand their job search into other Member States and will facilitate free movement of workers. In addition, we have just adopted today a proposal for the revision of the Posting of Workers Directive, which we discussed earlier, and there is some work underway for 2016. We foresee a fresh start to promote work—life balance for working parents, both men and women. We are also preparing a European Skills Agenda to be launched during the spring and, moreover, a comprehensive evaluation of the 24 occupational health and safety directives is ongoing. I intend to come forward with a proposal on carcinogens before the summer. In parallel with these concrete initiatives, we today launched a broad consultation on a first concrete outline of the European Pillar of Social Rights. President Juncker announced this initiative in his State of the Union address in September last year and the consultation will collect stakeholders’ views, including national parliaments’ and, of course, the European Parliament’s. I invite all of you to participate in the debate and also to come with the position of the Parliament if possible. We invite social partners at European and national level and civil society to participate in this debate.  Why a Pillar of Social Rights? Well, the European social model is a success story. The European Union is today the largest economy in the world and most of its citizens enjoy very high living standards. European values have materialised over time in a whole set of social rights, which are enshrined in national and European law as well as fundamental rights. However, we need to assess whether the European social model is still fit for purpose. We are confronted with long-term challenges and we are also still confronted with the aftermath of the crisis. I would say that it is time for a reality check. Are our European Union and our Member States’ policies on social affairs, in the broad sense of the word, still up to date? Are they future-proofed for the 21st century? Those are the questions. This is particularly important for the euro area because we know that more convergence, including on social and labour market policy is essential for more resilience and for better stability of economic and monetary union. This is why the Pillar of Social Rights will, in the first instance, be there for the Member States of the euro area. But of course other Member States are welcome to join if they so wish. I am convinced that this double track is the right way to advance for a social triple—A: to take concrete initiatives that address people’s concerns and have a real impact on the ground – we have already launched more than ten – and, secondly, to initiate a joint reflection on how we want our European social model to develop in the 21st century so that it continues to work for people to deliver growth and opportunities for all.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Following the inaugural speech by President Juncker and also by yours, we had high expectations of you, Mrs Thyssen. We think far too little has happened so far. A little more social issues in the European Semester, a five-president report that does not turn away from austerity, and a non-binding communication on combating long-term unemployment. Well, today, after a year and a half, there were first initiatives. But with the announcements you have made now, that does little concrete to make a real, real triple-A for social that the people of Europe expect. A simple summary of all social rights in the social pillar does not help workers, nor does the restriction to the euro countries combat unfair competition, wage and social dumping. The Commission's clear focus must be on combating precarious employment, tackling unemployment, reducing poverty and reducing social exclusion. For this we need, for example, the definition of an employee concept, we need living wages, a minimum income and also the strengthening of collective bargaining partners.

Arming our fellow citizens also means giving the same weapons to all, without unfair competition or race to the least social. At the same time, we must also allow our companies, whether industrial, artisanal or agricultural, to create jobs, which obviously requires a regulatory framework that is favourable to them and encourages them to invest and innovate.

Worse still, I think that if there is no process of social convergence, then it is the European Union that can be threatened, because the anti-European, Europhobic voices, which advocate nationalist withdrawal, will then gain even more power than they have today.

Despite a recovering labour market, one figure remains the same: one in five young people is out of work and that is an absolute disgrace.  Through the Youth Employment Initiative, the Commissioner briefly played the ball. She quickly cleared more pennies, and successfully. For example, youth unemployment in Brussels is falling for the 33rd month in a row. But one swallow does not make spring: much work is still on the shelf, such as the agenda for new skills for Europe, which I will look at with great attention. Labour mobility must also be higher and, above all, fairer. A social Europe is a Europe where the rules are the same for everyone. My generation must never again be called \"the lost generation.\" That is why Europe must and can be made much more social.

I would like to thank you for this rich debate. We have heard a lot of comments. I note that your support for a social triple A is very strong, but that there is no consensus here too on what exactly is needed. It is true that everything is needed and that we have to work on it. We do indeed have quite a few problems that we have to deal with at the same time. We are - and I hear we share this concern - with the aftermath of the crisis. We are facing increased poverty in Europe. While the aim was to reduce poverty, the crisis has increased poverty.  While we see that youth unemployment is falling every month, it remains far too high with 4.5 million young unemployed people who do not find a job. We know that half of our unemployed are long-term unemployed. We cannot accept that either. We see that our labour market is becoming more and more segmented and that we simply accept this as a given without acting against it. We are therefore trying to counter-gas.  We also need to look at the challenges we face. We have a aftermath of the crisis, but in the meantime the world has not stopped. We face long-term challenges, with long-term trends in society, in the economy and in our labour market. In society, we only have to look at demographic evolution, at the change of family structures, at the ageing population. But if we look at the economy and the labour market, we see globalisation, digitisation, new labour models. Then we have to deal with new business models, which we are not going to stop and that we should not stop. But we must give the right answer to this in order to ensure that we have a social policy and that the people who deserve our protection, who need protection at more times in their lives than before, can also count on that assistance, that activation.  We also need to look at what is needed to combat more inequality. More convergence is needed, because we know that more inequality in society is a barrier to economic growth and that does not help us in any way. Less inequality, more convergence, upward convergence, that's what we want to go for! Of course, this is not an easy matter. We need to look at what is needed for equal opportunities and equal access to the labour market. We will have to look at our skills agenda, at the education that is needed, not just when people are young. Lifelong learning, upskilling, reskilling, these are all issues that need to be reviewed in the future and that we will address in our skills agenda.  We also need to look at how we are going to improve social protection and social security. It is not just a matter of enert that the systems are sustainable and financially sustainable, but they must also be adequate. They have to cover the risks we want to cover. And we also need to look at fair working conditions. It is very clear - and this has been shown here by the various interventions - that this is not a matter that we can only tackle at European level. We also need the Member States. Together we need to develop an idea, a vision of where we want to go, and then implement it in mutual cooperation.  Nor is it a matter that will neither be inspired nor allowed by the minds of political leaders. We do indeed need - and you rightly pointed out - the social partners. They know the field. They can help us refine the right diagnosis, but they can also help us to work out the right solutions and, if we have solutions, to help implement them in concrete way. So it will be a work of all of us together. We will have to do it together at different levels of policy, with the social partners! I therefore again invite you to study in detail that package of documents that has been launched today, which consists of an explanation of what exactly we mean by that European pillar of social rights. In the annex to that document, we show a first outline of what it might look like. Questions and suggestions are asked. But there are also two working documents, one with an overview of the social acquis so far, primary and secondary law, international law, soft law, and one with the financial instruments at our disposal and with which we can strongly support the good things that the Member States should and want to do. We all need to take a very good look at that. The economic trends, the economic developments that are underway are also analysed. Also on this a document has been included in the package and I invite you, as well as the national parliaments, the governments, the social partners and the Economic and Social Committee, to really come up with input to work out a new plan on how we can ensure that - as Tom Vandekendelaere and others have said here - it also for the children , for today's young people is still good coexistence. How we can also ensure for them that we maintain a social market economy worthy of that name. And if we can draw out and realize that social market economy, then we will have earned our social triple A. Because what is at stake - and I will repeat it again - is that we need to ensure economic growth, that we make it possible and create it. An economic growth that gives rise to job creation, to quality jobs and to good social protection of the people. That's what we're doing! Not for nice words. It's a commitment. It is a commitment that we will have to make with many, that we must make good together with many. First, however, we need to clearly explain exactly how we see this. This is a good reason for this european pillar of social rights that we have launched today.  We call for a wide-ranging debate. There are those who say that there is no social Europe, that there is no work to be done. Well, in all the years I have been active in Europe and have also been active in this Parliament, I have not seen any previous calls for and so much preparatory work to be done for such a wide-ranging debate on the future of our social Europe.  So I'd say let's get to work. Let's work together. Let's draw that together. That is where we will be able to do good things for the people and that is where we will be able to ensure that even those who come after us find a Europe where life is good, where people have equal opportunities and where people who are less fortunate in their lives, who may have been given less talent or who have already committed a stupid act , can be kept on board. That people who need social protection, at any stage of their lives, can get it.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner Jourová, allow me first of all to thank the Commission, the shadow rapporteurs and the rotating Presidencies, Latvian and Luxembourg, under which the negotiations for the constructive approach taken during the work took place. It has been about a year since I was given the negotiating mandate following the approval by the COMMITTEE on LibE of the text of the directive we are debating today.  The work carried out during this period was motivated by the desire to create a measure, which for the first time considered the specificity of the juvenile process at supranational level, accompanied by clear guarantees for the children involved. It took 9 trilogues, sometimes very difficult and numerous technical meetings before reaching a final agreement, which I very much welcome and on which I hope there will be broad consensus in this House. With more than one million children being prosecuted in Europe each year, there are still significant differences between member states' legal systems in the treatment of children at different stages of the procedure.  The directive is intended to bridge these gaps by defining and identifying clear rights for children suspected or accused through a body of minimum standards which, however, establish a high level of guarantees. In fact, the main focus was on the best interests of the child, a principle also enshrined in Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is already known in civil and administrative matters and which thus enters the criminal process for the first time. I believe that the added value of the directive is that it has accompanied the juvenile procedure, as well as the fundamental safeguards provided for criminal proceedings involving adults, but also those required by the specific nature of minors, which must always be the recipients of specific adequate protection.  There are many aspects of the procedure involved in the directive, but I cannot dwell on them for reasons of time. I would, however, like to refer to Article 6 of the directive, which provides for the right of the child to be assisted by a lawyer. This is the most sensitive issue that has been addressed during the negotiations and I must say that I am satisfied with the compromise reached in the text which accurately describes the situations in which the presence of the defender is essential in order to ensure that the child is provided with technical assistance, the correct application of all the guarantees provided for and to help him understand the progress of the procedure involving him.  For this reason, while the directive provides for reasonable possibilities for derogation, in view of the lesser seriousness of the crime, the reduced complexity of the case and the measures that could be taken accordingly, the directive requires States to ensure the presence of the defender from the earliest stages of investigations and, in particular, when the child is questioned by the judicial police and, above all, in any case, in any case where he or she is deprived of his or her personal liberty. Another important provision is that which requires Member States to subject the child to an assessment carried out by qualified personnel, in order to support decisions on possible measures for the benefit of the child, on the adequacy of any precautionary measures and when the judgment is delivered.  In this connection, I would like to stress once again the importance of training those involved in the proceedings, starting with the police, magistrates and defenders. It is provided for in the directive that they have access to specific training so that they can ensure the best interests of the child. Finally, again in view of the specific needs of the child and his social reintegration at the end of criminal experience, detention is always considered as an extreme ratio, to be available when alternative measures are not effectively viable. And, where it is inevitable to deprive the child of personal freedom, he must do everything possible to safeguard his psychophysical development and his needs for re-education.  That is why I believe that one of the most significant aspects of the directive is that it has established for the first time at European level the principle of separate detention of children. For all these reasons, I am convinced that the directive is heading in the right direction for the definition of a common model of juvenile due process, also contributing in the criminal field, to the achievement of child justice.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1964, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Caterina CHINNICI", "mepid": "124861", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, Members ate to vote on the text of the Directive on procedural safeguards for children suspected or accused in criminal proceedings. This directive is particularly important as it gives specific rights to children involved in criminal proceedings in the European Union and provides for overarching protection at all stages of these proceedings. Children are particularly vulnerable in criminal proceedings due to their young age and immaturity. Around 1 million children in the EU are estimated to come into contact with the police and judiciary every year. They need therefore the highest possible protection. This directive is an important step forward in the construction of an area of justice in the European Union. Today there are large disparities in the level of protection offered in the European Union applicable to children in criminal proceedings in the Member States. In some cases, the level of protection is insufficient compared with the well-recognised international standards. The directive, once adopted, will significantly strengthen the procedural safeguards for children when confronted with criminal justice in the EU throughout all the proceedings. Moreover, the directive will also contribute to the development of an effective model of juvenile justice. The new rules will ensure the fair trial rights for children during criminal proceedings; they will also prevent children from re-offending and will foster their social integration. I would like to congratulate and thank the Parliament rapporteur, Mrs Chinnici, for her remarkable work and personal dedication on this file, which made an agreement on this directive possible after long and difficult negotiations.  The outcome of the negotiations is a very well balanced text which endorses the principle laid down in Article 24 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights that ‘the child’s best interests shall always be a primary consideration’.  Notably, children will benefit from assistance by a lawyer in serious and complex cases and every time they are in detention. Deprivation of liberty cannot be imposed as a sanction unless the child has been assisted by a lawyer, at least during the hearings before the court. Children will also benefit from other safeguards such as assistance by their parents or other appropriate persons. They will also have the right to protection of privacy, including the possibility of having court hearings held in the absence of the public. Furthermore, children will also have the right to an individual assessment to make sure that their specific needs concerning protection, education and social integration are fully taken into account.  Finally, the Commission is also very satisfied that the text foresees that children should be kept separately from adults in police custody and pre-trial detention, unless this is not in the best interests of the child. This directive will give a strong signal that the European Union strongly cares about children, the most vulnerable persons involved in criminal proceedings. Therefore, I strongly encourage you to vote in favour of this directive today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1965, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Pál CSÁKY", "mepid": "124930", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – First and foremost, I congratulate Mrs Chinnici on her work and thank her for her excellent cooperation. As the people's party responsible for this report, I am very pleased that we have succeeded in creating a directive that is acceptable to Parliament as well as to the Member States. An important aspect of the negotiations was the transposition and feasibility of the Directive. I think that has been achieved and we are voting tomorrow on a text that will bring real assurances to the children of suspects and accused children. For me, it was important to create legislation that would stand up to the real world. Such a critical point in the negotiations was, for example, the right to legal assistance. Although, as a general principle, it is acceptable that every child has the right to help a lawyer, because they have even less understood what is happening to them than adults. However, there are also cases where this is impractical and ultimately we are punishing children if we expect it to be unconditionally ensured. It is also important that deprivation of liberty should only take place as a lasting event and for the shortest possible time and that children should be kept in isolation from adults. Involvement in criminal proceedings can stigmatise the child, reduce their chances of reintegration into society and affect their future professional and social lives.

There are worrying differences in the treatment of children in the Member States in the face of criminal proceedings, which just proves that the legal protection of underage eu citizens is not sufficient. In the case of a crime involving children, children must be subject to legal assistance and custody immediately after detention. All information provided to them should be transmitted in a manner adapted to their age and maturity. And, most importantly, the language they understand, regardless of their nationality, nor the place of accommodation, without any discrimination on the basis of language. Member States must ensure that all cases with children are handled with care and care.

Madam President, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has The European Parliament is struggling to take a stand to meet the political challenges facing the European Union. The European Parliament is taking the trouble to describe the current challenges and to deduce the financial consequences. And the Council of the European Union? He sends us a four-page paper, which is to its vast part copy and paste of the 2016 directive. Of course, the annual figures have been exchanged, here and there a formulation has been adapted – but that was it.  I know from the Council's deliberations that the German Government has made every effort to emphasise the challenges of the refugee crisis. However, it cannot have been very successful in this, because otherwise there could be no Council directives which do not in any way reflect the dramatic developments of the last twelve months. What is the situation? The 2016 budget mobilises more than €5 billion in the domestic and foreign policy categories to eliminate the causes of flight, feed, care for refugees in Syria's neighbouring countries, educate children and help EU Member States cope with the refugee crisis. As a result, the margins had to be fully exploited up to the upper limits of these categories. The Council agreed to renounce the margins it so cherished, which are to be held back for the unforeseen – so great was the need.  Has the situation since then eased? On the contrary. But the Council is taking the same position as we did in the spring of 2015, when we were still a long way from the peak of the migration movement. This borders on denial of reality.  We are preparing the 4th budget within the framework of the current multiannual financial framework. This year, too, it will become clear that the money will not be enough if the EU is to cope with the tasks assigned to it by the Member States. The first supplementary budget for 2016 will require an additional €250 million for the first Turkey facility, which has not yet been budgeted. In the budget for which I have political responsibility, that is another EUR 750 million. Since the weekend, we have known that there will most likely be a second Turkey facility. I am sure that the EU budget will once again have to contribute at least EUR 1 billion. We also need around €700 million to make the new humanitarian aid instrument within the EU effective.  I think all these measures make sense. Turkey has taken in more refugees than all EU countries combined. It is in the EU's well-understood self-interest to support Turkey in providing for the refugees. Humanitarian aid is also important and right, because this crisis is overburdening every Member State that is left alone. But if these are all priorities, then the Council must do one of two things: either explain what is no longer to be financed or adapt the financial resources to the increased challenges. He doesn't do either. He does business as usual. This will not work as it did last year, because the ceiling is simply too short.  Now we have a chance to respond to the new situation. That would be the revision of the medium-term financial framework, which is due to start at the end of the year. I therefore appeal once again to the Council: stop the denial of reality and make the European budget crisis-proof – this year, not 2020! This would also include applying the Stability Pact in such a way that Member States' contributions to the EU budget are not counted against their current budget deficit. The Committee on Budgets has decided to this, to my satisfaction. This is a decision which the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to my displeasure, intends to withdraw in tomorrow's vote with Amendment No 21. Ladies and gentlemen of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, how can a state such as Greece at the same time fulfil the overwhelming conditions of the Troika, fulfil its tasks in protecting the EU's external border and provide for the refugees stranded at the border? How can Portugal show more solidarity in the refugee crisis if this country's budget is to be kept so rigid? No, we must be consistent here and allow flexibility. I would therefore ask colleagues to vote tomorrow with my group against the PPE-DE's Amendment No 21. I would also like to say a word to the friends of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance. I would like your group to be able to vote in favour of guidelines at the end, even if they contain positive wording on the ITER fusion reactor. The fight against nuclear energy is part of my political biography. I really thought about how I feel about ITER.  If I only click on the The exit will also cost money: at least EUR 4 billion. However, we are also renouncing major innovations that we urgently need, for example in the field of control technology or new active ingredients, if we were to dispense with ITER. I am in favour of ITER, together with my group.  But there is no contradiction in the fact that the development of the project will have to be closely monitored and look closely at whether the financial needs are set correctly and whether it is not so high. If we come to the conclusion that this financial need should be too high, then we should find a better benefit for these funds if they are not yet needed for ITER. My request is: strengthen the European Parliament in our debate for a sufficient budget! Don't weaken the house because of a dissent in a question! What could solve our budgetary problems as a whole would be a sufficient system of own resources. We have the Lamassoure report, which this House adopted in 2008: no additional burdens on the European taxpayer, but a system of own resources that allows the EU to finance its tasks. The High Expert Group, led by Mario Monti, is working on proposals for this. I expect the Council to engage constructively in this debate. Yes, that's what's working. But this work could be rewarded by the fact that in future the Council would have to do even less work with the budget as copy and paste, because the parliament would be solely responsible for the budget, as it should be in a democracy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1989, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Jens GEIER", "mepid": "96833", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Geier, very much for recognising the important role of the EU budget to deal with crises and, at the same time, to continue to support the economic recovery, growth and jobs in Europe. This is what we foresee for 2017 as well. We will face another challenging year in budgetary terms: we will have to cope with the impact of the refugee crisis, people will need to be integrated, new arrivals will most likely continue, and we will have to continue to support investments in Europe. In that context we also very much welcome Parliament’s recognition that, with needs growing and pressures on the budget increasing, we ought to focus more on the results of our work. That budget focus on results will be a centrepiece in our work for 2017. Let me make four points. First, on the migration and refugee crisis, we have been stretching all flexibilities of the budget, for which we are very grateful to the Parliament. It is you that delivered it and we would have been lost if we did not have it. We will continue to do so. As you can see, we anticipate challenges, the most recent one being the necessity to create the new instrument to provide humanitarian assistance inside Europe. We will fund the Turkey facility in the budget for 2016. We already have projections. I am pleased to say that EUR 95 million, our first investment, is now already working there and of course we have an obligation to secure the funds in 2017 and most likely also in 2018. My second point is on another priority we should not forget. It is to continue to wipe out the unpaid bills that have accumulated from the previous financial period. We melted it down to EUR 8.2 billion and we will have a chance to present our analysis on the drivers for this more accelerated shrinkage of the unpaid bills and the consequences for future years when we have our first meeting of the interinstitutional dialogue on payments and outstanding commitments on 14 March, just before the discussion on our 2017 guidelines for the budget. My third point concerns what is ahead of us that is very important in 2017. In line with the MFF regulation, Article 7, we will have to review the cohesion policy envelopes, and that will lead to a revision of the commitment and the payment ceilings decided by the Commission on technical grounds. We will have the analysis of the Youth Employment Initiative and very important decisions to be taken on the basis of this analysis. We will have this in mid-April, in other words in about a month’s time. In 2017 we will have the obligation to complete the 5% reduction of staff and I take this opportunity to again urge all of us to do that with discipline. Since today is International Women’s Day, let me finish by recognising that the Parliament has placed in the guidelines encouragement for the Commission to work on gender mainstreaming in the budget. Last, but absolutely not least, in 2016 we are faced not only with the draft 2017 budget, but also with the review and revision of the multinannual financial framework. While these two events will not necessarily be combined, we will have to think of both as we work on the 2017 budget and it will of course have implications.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1990, "date": "2016-03-08.json", "name": "Siegfried MUREŞAN", "mepid": "124802", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, firstly I would like to thank the rapporteur for the work which he has done, for the draft report which he put forward and for the good cooperation which we had throughout the process between our two political groups.

On the continuation of economic recovery we are going to allocate enough resources to research, innovation and infrastructure, all very important in order to improve the competitiveness of the European economy, to strengthen the European economy and to lead to the creation of more jobs.  As regards tackling the refugee crisis, Parliament’s position is very clear and it is also outlined in the guidelines which we will adopt with a very large majority tomorrow. Parliament sees the budget of the European Union as part of the solution. Parliament was always ready to act fast last year, as it is this year, when a crisis situation occurs, but likewise Member States of the European Union also have to fulfil their commitments in allocating enough financial resources to Africa, to the Madad Fund, to the Turkey Refugee Facility.

Indeed, our ability to respond to crises will determine our common future. We need political and solidarity responses. By that I mean that the coordination of national means is no longer enough. We must work to harmonize and put in place common tools where the stakes are common. An example: the question of borders is one of those trials of truth. We can no longer just coordinate the action of states. We need Community officers and a common border policy if we are to save free movement.  This much-needed political breakthrough will not happen without a financial effort. Today, however, the limits of the Union's budget do not allow this effort.

I make three points. First, it is important that the EU operate within the budget which was agreed within the MFF and therefore, despite the immediate and pressing nature of many of the problems facing the Union, they should not be used as a reason to call for a bigger budget. Rather, the Commissioner is absolutely right to introduce performance-based budgeting, and would be right to pursue both value for money and European added value. Secondly, I understand and I do share the rapporteur’s concerns for the levels of youth unemployment. I fully accept that in times of crisis politicians will want to be seen to be responding. After all, who would not wish to see vastly improved employment prospects for young people? But a word of caution: experience has taught us that youth unemployment schemes have generally been strong on intent but disappointing in delivery. The one thing that would help young unemployed people more than anything else is a strong, vibrant and expanding economy. That brings me to my third point. I do understand that attention is likely to be focused on the immediate crises in agriculture, in security and the refugees.

Madam President, Commissioner, we are now, as has been said enough, facing formidable challenges. First, there is the far too low level of economic growth, especially investment, resulting in too high unemployment, which remains unbearable among young people.

There is still the terrorist threat, which, however latent it may be today, nevertheless remains fraught with threats of carnage and massacres.

If we do not start from this basic concept, it is very difficult to try to improve the current situation.  An increase in the Union's budget is utopian, although it is undeniable that some programmes probably need more resources. I believe, however, that there are very few programmes in which the Union can be more effective than the Member States in addressing the current challenges and critical issues. According to the Commission's triumphalist announcements, the Juncker Plan was supposed to be the example of a great European project, but it is only proving to be a different way for individual Member States to decide on projects that have been planned for some time, with no added value.  At this point, I wonder whether it does not make sense perhaps to let countries make freer use of their investment capacities, without having to comply with absurd constraints or European superstructures. The European states regard the EU budget as something alien to them, useful only for recovering funds for spot initiatives and measures, such as the Juncker Plan or the billion-dollar bill to be sent to Erdogan, in vain in the hope that the issue of immigration could be resolved.

I am sure that phone call from an aide hours before the sacking was 100% coincidence. Right? The Prime Minister, who promised us he would have net migration down to the tens of thousands a year if he was elected. Well, okay, I cannot excuse that one at all.

To do this, we need to maintain economic development, which cohesion policy does. The reallocation of funds can improve the situation in the short term, but it jeopardises the economic situation, including long-term integration.

It demonstrates how serious the task ahead of us is. We have many pressing needs in Europe and we will have to prioritise our resources and use the resources better. In that sense, I agree with those who have spoken about the necessity to prioritise competitiveness, growth and jobs, firstly, and then, secondly, to make sure that we are able to deal with what has been the biggest challenge for Europe in our lifetime.  We are extremely focused on anticipating where problems may arise and this is why we have changed the instruments in our hands, including the capacity to provide humanitarian assistance inside Europe, and I can tell you that in the Commission we started thinking about this long before it became a pressing need in Greece.  We do not know what else may come our way but we know that in a world that is more fragile, where shocks are more frequent, we have to be prepared to respond quickly and in a more agile way to protect the security of our citizens, to provide new opportunities where they are wiped out by crises, and for this I would conclude by saying that first I agree that never mind how stretched our budget is we have to have space for some flexibility for a quick response when needs arise.  Secondly, we do have to think in a more creative way about how we use money – can we achieve more than one objective with the same euro? I will give you a small example here. We took EUR 30 million from the EUR 500 million to deal with the milk crisis last year, to give it to the World Food Programme to buy milk from our farmers and feed children in refugee camps. We have to think in a much more creative way about the 2017 budget and those that are to follow.  My last point is yes, we need money, but in this very tough time for us we need our unity even more.

It is important that the European Commission already anticipates in its draft budget the accelerated implementation of regional development programmes in the Member States, thereby increasing cohesion resources proportionately. In 2017, our aim is for the European Commission to fully pay the bills generated by the projects already carried out in the Member States.  According to the European Parliament, the 2017 budget should also ensure that funds mobilised to deal with the migration crisis are not taken at the expense of other EU programmes already in place. This proposal protects cohesion and agricultural funds when determining resources to deal with the migration crisis. The European Parliament underlines the importance of school milk and fruit schemes. On our proposal, the European Commission should examine how the resources that can be used to finance these programmes can be raised in the 2017 budget.

What I cannot continue to support, however, is the arbitrary decision-making by the Member States on the creation of ad hoc European financial instruments without consulting the European Parliament, which is one of the official budgetary authorities. These instruments, which parliament was faced with as a done deal, undermine the principle of unity in the European budget and raise questions about budgetary transparency and accountability. It is therefore necessary for the next instruments to be created under the standard legislative procedure and for the 2017 budget and the Multiannual Financial Framework to be prepared for them.

I therefore pay particular attention to the need to set an appropriate payment ceiling in the 2017 budget. The late implementation of the programmes under the Multiannual Financial Framework 2014-2020 risks creating a gap between commitments and payments and the accumulation of late payments in the second half of the 2014-2020 MFF, which inevitably leads to new difficulties for ongoing programmes.
