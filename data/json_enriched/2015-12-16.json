Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the agenda for the December European Council meeting will be very dense. The European Council will address fundamental issues for Europe such as migration, the fight against terrorism, economic and monetary union, the internal market, the Energy Union and climate policy, as well as the issue of the referendum in the United Kingdom. This European Council aims not only to tackle the current crises, but also aims to provide general policy directions for the future. The Council has worked all these issues, much has been done in recent months, and let me now detail the various issues. The first question is about migration. The first priority for all of us is the implementation of what we have decided. All the institutions are working hard to implement the conclusions of the European Council, but the scale of the crisis reminds us every day that this is no longer enough. Managing its immediate effects is essential, but establishing rules and enforcing them is equally essential. The aim is to examine the situation on the ground and to fill the current deficiencies in particular with regard to hotspots, relocations and returns. We must first strengthen the protection of our external borders in the Schengen area in order to stem the flow of irregular migrants. Frontex needs to be strengthened and the countries that are asking for it, such as Greece now, must be able to count on effective assistance. Maintaining the Schengen area, which must be our absolute objective, requires us to improve the management of our external borders. I believe that the Commission has made important proposals in this regard. Continued cooperation with countries of origin and transit is also crucial operationally, but also in order to address the root causes of migration. In this context, the European Council also intends to adopt conclusions on Syria, marking a determined support for all efforts towards a political process, but also expressing a willingness to fight all terrorist forces. The second question deals specifically with the fight against terrorism. After the Paris attacks, a number of measures were adopted and must now be implemented quickly. One of the most important issues is cooperation and information exchange. It is not a question of creating an agency such as the CIA, or whatever other European agency, but we need to deepen and systematise cooperation between the relevant services. The agreement on the European NRL will also play a decisive role in the fight against terrorism, and I would like to thank Mr Kirkhope and all those who have worked on an agreement on this difficult issue. In this area too, cooperation with third countries is of course an absolute necessity. The third question is about economic and monetary union. The report of the five presidents to complete it was presented last June. Since then, work has progressed well within the various council formations. The Commission presented follow-up proposals on 21 October, and you debated them yesterday in plenary. We all agree that reform of the euro area remains a necessity. The European Council is called upon to give direction to the continuation of the work, a number of issues - unfortunately we must admit - remain controversial and therefore need to be clarified quickly. The President of the European Council also wants an in-depth discussion on the basis on which the institutions can move the work forward. The fourth item on the Council's agenda concerns the internal market, which is the very foundation of European integration. The Commission has recently submitted a number of communications and reports which will be the basis of the European Council's discussions. The aim is to strengthen and deepen the internal market in several areas where there are still deficiencies. This applies to goods and services, with a new strategy, but this applies in particular and above all to the digital internal market as well as to the Union of Capital Markets. We need to revitalise the internal market in the interests of growth, competitiveness and employment.  We have all welcomed the success of COP 21 on the Energy Union and climate change. On this subject, too, there was a debate yesterday. The European Council will of course take notice of this and instruct the Council and the Commission to assess the results, particularly in light of the 2030 climate and energy framework. Now is the time for implementation and, again, Europe must also lead the way and be exemplary. The European Council will also return to the issue of the Energy Union for an in-depth discussion next March. Finally, the question of the referendum in the United Kingdom. After extensive consultations, the President of the European Council set out his intentions in a letter to his colleagues on 7 December. The December European Council is not expected to make a decision on the UK's demands; it will be an opportunity for a political discussion on all the issues raised. The form and content of a possible agreement will be developed at a later stage. In his letter to the members of the European Council, President Tusk also informed the Heads of State and Government that he had asked the Presidency to put the issue of sanctions policy against Russia on the COREPER agenda. Finally, I would like to express, once again, our thanks for the responsibility and commitment that the European Parliament has made on the many current issues and challenges, including the issue of migration.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Nicolas SCHMIT", "mepid": "197428", "text": "   President of the Commission. – Mr President, the main issues of discussion for tomorrow’s European Council will be the management of the refugee crisis, the implementation of our security agenda and the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union. I said in the State of the Union speech on 9 September, and I want to repeat it, that this is no time for business as usual. No time for half-measures, no time for hesitation. I announced plans for a European Border and Coast Guard, and here we are. The Commission has now agreed those plans, and I call on Parliament and the Council to treat them as a matter of urgency. We have no time to lose when it comes to preserving the Schengen area of free movement. (Applause) For this, effective management of our external borders must be a priority. The Commission is not the government of the European Union – this seems to be news to you, Mr Farage! He would like the Commission to be the government of Europe! – (Laughter) ...but when the situation requires so, when there are threats to our ways of living together, we have to take responsibility and prepare a collective response.  We have done this for the banking system by transferring preventive and remedial mechanisms to the European level – because the crisis has shown that national authorities were left alone to deal with transnational problems. The proposal we put forward yesterday, under the leadership of my good friend Frans Timmermans and Commissioner Avramopoulos, for a European Border and Coast Guard, follows the same logic. It will bring the missing link to strengthen our external borders, so that people can continue to live and move freely within our Union. We Europeans no longer have many borders: we have one, and we have a shared responsibility to protect it. The European Border and Coast Guard is not the answer to a new need. The European Border and Coast Guard is there to repair a weakness in our Schengen system. We are completing what should have been done from the start. Member States will continue to keep their competence and sovereignty on their borders. They will continue to manage the external border day to day. The European Border and Coast Guard will assess migratory flows across the whole of the Union, identify our weak spots, and require Member States to take action when needed. Member States will be able to request joint operations and rapid border interventions. But where urgent problems persist and no action is taken, the Commission will assume its responsibility for the system as a whole and take – together with the Member States – appropriate decisions for the European Border and Coast Guard to intervene. If there is a serious problem at our external border, we cannot stand aside and do nothing. We have to act. The Commission proposes to establish a permanent staff of 1 000 and a reserve pool of at least 1 500 experts who can be deployed within 72 hours. A new European Return Office within the new Agency will accelerate the return of irregular migrants by deploying teams of specialists across the Union. A new standard travel document for return will ensure the wider acceptance of returnees by third countries.  All of you know my views on Schengen, but to avoid any doubt, let me be absolutely clear: under my leadership we will do everything possible to protect what we have built, and to make it better and stronger. (Applause) We want to defend everything that Schengen represents, and as we prepare for a new year, our determination is stronger than ever. So let me tell you: Schengen is here to stay. This is why the Commission proposes to strengthen the Schengen Border Code so that every person entering the Schengen area – whether they are an EU national or a third country national – will undergo a security check against national and European databases. And checks on all individuals will now be mandatory when exiting the European Union as well. These are the costs of a riskier world, and we cannot avoid them. Tomorrow, I will call on the European Council to respond positively and urgently to all of these proposals. Here, I want to thank this House for its support over the course of this year. Parliament worked closely with the Commission when it mattered most. You responded quickly and diligently to all of our proposals, and I count on your support as we continue our work together. The refugee crisis does not begin at Europe’s borders. Last month, we opened a new chapter in our relations with Turkey, a country that already hosts 2.2 million refugees – more than any other country in the world. The situation demands that we work together. Yesterday, the Commission adopted a Recommendation for a Voluntary Humanitarian Admission Scheme for refugees from Syria who are currently in Turkey. If our neighbour is facing a humanitarian emergency, then we have a duty to help. All 28 Member States have worked on this proposal, but it remains voluntary. Those Member States that want to help can do so. I hope that all 28 are ready to help.  Mr President, when I came to you in September, Europe was not in good shape. Our governments were very busy blaming each other, or pointing the finger at Brussels. The situation required urgent action. On 29 September, the Commission adopted a Communication outlining the immediate operational, budgetary and legal measures under the European Agenda on Migration. We concluded that the implementation of European Union Law with regard to building a Common European Asylum System had been proceeding too slowly in the Member States. As a result, on 15 October we presented a Communication setting out the next steps for the next six months. In particular, the Commission called on Greece and Italy to roll-out the remaining hotspots, to operationalise those existing, to improve the registration capacity within the Eurodac fingerprinting system and to organise the swift transfer of migrants from hotspot areas to second-line reception facilities. The situation in Greece and in Italy has improved, but there still remain things to be done. This is why I convened the leaders of the Western Balkans, to bring everyone round the table and to start a conversation. As a result, our officials now talk on a daily basis and coordinate actions across the whole of the region. I know that it will take some time before we fully control every aspect of the situation, but we are moving in the right direction. The European Union’s humanitarian assistance to the Western Balkans now stands at EUR 22 million, helping to give comfort and restore dignity to thousands of refugees along that route. But make no mistake. Progress is still too slow, and our Member States need to do more, and they need to do it quickly. While they accelerate relocations and returns, they must also agree on the crisis relocation mechanism so that Europe can react more quickly in the future. They need to agree on the safe countries of origin, so that we can increase the efficiency of the asylum system and speed up the return of irregular migrants. They need to match the funding that the European Union has mobilised for the Syria Trust Fund. And they need to deliver everything agreed at the Valletta Summit, where we launched a new partnership with our African neighbours. We need to honour all our commitments, and we need to do it now. This is the message I will take once again to the European Council tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. Monsieur le Président, Mesdames, Messieurs, les Européens veulent pouvoir continuer à vivre en sécurité dans un espace où la libre circulation contribue à leur façon de vivre, d'étudier et de travailler. Mais les images qui ont marqué cette année 2015 et resteront gravées dans leur mémoire, celles des récents événements à Paris, rappellent que le pire est toujours possible. Chaque jour à travers l'Europe, 24 heures sur 24, des hommes et des femmes, qu'ils soient policiers, gendarmes, magistrats ou juges, sont entièrement dévoués à assurer la sécurité de nos citoyens. Nous avons l'obligation de faciliter leur travail en leur donnant les outils nécessaires pour qu'ils puissent mieux coordonner leurs actions dans ce qui est, pour eux, un combat de tous les jours. Bien sûr, la sauvegarde de la sécurité est une prérogative nationale, mais il est évident qu'une meilleure coordination au niveau européen s'impose, y compris pour ce qui est de la collaboration entre les services secrets. Le terrorisme ne connaît aucune frontière et, donc, notre réponse doit être globale.  Quoi qu'en disent certains, qui se livrent à de dangereux amalgames, les terroristes voyageant vers l'Europe préfèrent le confort des avions à la précarité d'embarcations de fortune. Je me réjouis donc que nous soyons enfin parvenus à un accord sur le registre européen des passagers, et je remercie tous les acteurs du Parlement européen qui ont travaillé pour parvenir à ce résultat. Selon l'agence Europol, quelque 5 000 Européens seraient partis combattre dans des pays comme la Syrie ou l'Iraq. Certains d'entre eux sont déjà rentrés. Parmi eux, quelques-uns se sont attaqués avec une violence inouïe aux sociétés qui les ont vus naître et qui les ont vus grandir. Face à ce phénomène, nous devons adapter et intensifier l'arsenal juridique de l'Union européenne en matière de prévention et de répression des actes terroristes, y compris pour ce qui touche au financement des activités terroristes. C'est là tout l'objet de la nouvelle directive présentée par la Commission sur la lutte contre le terrorisme, que j'espère voir adoptée rapidement. Dans tous les cas, nous ne devons jamais oublier que liberté et sécurité ne sont pas antinomiques. Préserver et défendre cette compatibilité entre liberté et sécurité, c'est aussi ce qui fait notre façon de vivre ensemble. C'est une question d'identité, c'est une question de valeurs. Puisque, Monsieur le Président, le Conseil européen sera l'occasion de discuter de l'Union économique et monétaire et du marché intérieur, c'est l'occasion de rappeler que la liberté va aussi de pair avec la prospérité.  L'innovation, la croissance, l'emploi, la compétitivité n'aiment pas les frontières. Lorsque nous avons un problème dans un de nos pays, nous devons essayer d'apporter une réponse globale au problème de ce pays. Lorsque nous avons le même problème dans plusieurs pays, nous avons l'obligation d'agir – je le dis notamment en relation avec la situation grave dans laquelle se trouve la sidérurgie européenne ces jours-ci. Ce n'est pas en se repliant sur soi que l'Europe pourra répondre aux attentes des Européens, qui veulent pouvoir créer une entreprise, trouver les financements y afférents, avoir à leur disposition des marchés ouverts, des systèmes de communication et de transport performants, des approvisionnements énergétiques sûrs et des facteurs énergétiques bon marché.  C'est pourquoi, lorsque nous avons présenté notre programme de travail, nous avons insisté sur la nécessité de parfaire notre marché intérieur là où il est imparfait et de le parachever là où il est incomplet – faire l'Union du numérique, l'Union des marchés de capitaux, l'Union de l'énergie. Je me réjouis de l'accord qui a été trouvé récemment à Paris, dit \"accord climatique\", qui nous permettra de progresser dans ces objectifs fixés par l'Union de l'énergie, tout en renforçant notre contribution financière pour l'action climatique dans les pays en voie de développement. Ein abschießendes Wort zur Europäischen Union und zu ihrer absehbaren Zukunft. In Europa war nie etwas einfach, und in Europa wird es nie einfach sein, Dinge und Menschen, Menschen und Dinge zusammenzubringen. Aber immer wieder, wenn es Probleme gab, sind Männer und Frauen aufgestanden, weil sie nicht Geschichte erdulden wollten, sondern Geschichte gestalten wollten. (Beifall) So war es immer, und so wird es bleiben. Das Unmögliche erscheint so lange unmöglich, bis es gemacht ist.

I would therefore like to express my thanks to the Commission for this year of delivery, of proposals, of presenting the ideas for the future of Europe. And we in the European Parliament have tried to give legislative backing for this, to give legislative backing. Yesterday's last proposal, Mr President, fits in seamlessly. The idea of improving the protection of external borders in order to keep Europe free at home is exactly the same logic that Europe is delivering. I would like to signal support for my group. When I hear today that there is now a debate across Europe as to whether national sovereignty is to be preserved, my group values national sovereignty, the pride of the Member States, very strongly, very highly. But the question that in Greece, Hungary, Poland, and also in Spain, the European border is not secured, but the European border is obvious. That is why we want Frontex to be strengthened. And if the citizens are asked today, they will answer: I don't really care if that regulates my nation state or anyone else. I want the law to be implemented at Europe's external border. That is what the citizens of Europe want, and that is where we should support the Commission. (Applause) On my group's mind, I would like to say that we will not be in favour of legislation on the Frontex mandate if the command issue is not resolved. The central question is: if a Member State does not implement anything at the external border, then someone else must be able to secure the borders accordingly, and that is Frontex. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which Secondly, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Schmit, for joining tomorrow's Council, because he has described that tomorrow you will not be presenting new ideas, new drafts for the future, but rather a balance sheet council, where we take stock of what has been achieved, because this is bitterly necessary. Please do not have any new ideas, but simply implement the points that have been agreed. I read, for example, that the Italian and British Governments are now together putting very great ideas on the table for the Lisbon issues, for the ever closer Union, for all these formulations. I have to say that we can talk about all this, but the most important thing would simply be for the Italian and British Governments to make their commitments on the Africa Fund, for the money to be made available at last, or for the relocation mechanism, namely the almost 40 000 refugees from Italy promised to be relocated, to be made at last! So we do not need new ideas, but we need the decisions to be implemented at long last. (Applause) Thirdly, I would like to make a very basic remark today also at the end of 2015, because we often discuss in the institutions between ourselves as professionals and too little in the eyes of the citizens. We all know that citizens are concerned when it comes to Europe when it comes to the further development of Europe. And that is why I would like to make an attempt today to make a call, not to talk about crisis Europe, not to talk about the concerns that Europe could fail tomorrow, as is often read in the newspapers, but i would simply like to list a few facts of what has been achieved in 2015. Ladies and gentlemen, in January 2015 we had Charlie Hebdo. Today, in these weeks, we have adopted the necessary legislative responses in the fight against terrorism – PNR, Europol mandate. In the spring and in recent years, dear friends, ladies and gentlemen, we have had thousands of deaths in the Mediterranean who have died on the run. Since the spring of this year, almost all European naval units have been deployed in the Mediterranean to rescue refugees, we have saved thousands of lives, and we now even have a robust mandate, thanks to the intervention of Federica Mogherini, to be able to combat the smugglers there. In the summer, we had Greece on the table, a truly historic issue. And, thanks to Jean-Claude Juncker, Greece has succeeded in keeping Greece in the euro area and giving the people there a stable perspective. And although even the Communists now have to carry out the necessary pension reforms in Greece, we have succeeded, thank God, in making progress there. We have had the question of Ukraine on the table all year round. Ladies and gentlemen, it is a huge success that the European Union is united in extending the sanctions, that we are united in the answer. Russian nationalism, which we unfortunately experience. We had the climate summit in Paris a few days ago. Ladies and gentlemen, without the courageous progress of our continent, including this European Parliament, on climate change, that we want to fight climate change, Paris would have been unthinkable. As Europeans, we have been the shining example of the world in the fight against climate change. Two more points: data protection: if I imagine that we are now regulating data protection, where we are trying to tame these instruments – Google and Facebook – and also to set European standards – we are doing something for the citizens. Finally, ladies and gentlemen, we have 2% economic growth in the euro area, and growth is coming back. Something is being achieved in Europe. And I would like, ladies and gentlemen, that when we talk about Europe, we do not just go from one crisis summit to another crisis summit, but that we tell our citizens that we achieve a great deal if we tackle it together. I would like to see this openness. We have achieved a great deal, including in 2015, together in Europe. And that should also be the message to the British: Member States are important, national sovereignty is important, our Member States should and must be strong. But together we are stronger!

Last Sunday, French voters stopped the far right. Be ware though, that vote is a warning to everyone. A mixture of selfishness and nationalism has slowed down the impetus that the European Commission and this Parliament have given to European action. The vote French must open the eyes of those who still have their eyes ajar.  We must act. On immigration: the Commission's proposal to set up a new European corps for the protection of external borders is a good thing, but we also need the other pillars, which are a binding mechanism for the distribution of refugees and a review of the Dublin system.  Things are not going well on the distribution of refugees. The Member States have made commitments which must be respected; the Union is a community of law and non-compliance with the commitments made leads to its disintegration. So let us relocate the refugees immediately, as has already been decided, and take new initiatives to relocate more asylum seekers. On the Dublin system: everyone has said that this system is outdated, but we need a legislative measure to achieve overcoming it. All this must be done and must be done immediately, but action is also imperative in the light of the economic crisis. In this context, we consider it a provocation to call into question the flexibility, the principle of flexibility that is inherent in the Stability Pact. We need no less but more flexibility. The Juncker plan is a jewel that cannot remain in the glassware, it has great opportunities that must be seed, that must be explained, that must be disseminated in relation to local and regional self-government, national governments and the business system.  And it is also time for this famous triple A on social dumping to be put into practice. We expect the European Commission to approve the mobility package as soon as possible and to take action on all other initiatives on the priority aspects of social policies. Taking action also means not resigning yourself to the disappearance of industries in Europe, as you have mentioned with great concern. The steel industry is threatened by commercial dumping, if we do not move immediately the European steel industry will be wiped out with the loss of thousands and thousands of jobs, we cannot fail to listen to the cry for help that comes from entrepreneurs and workers.  Mr Juncker, I am addressing you, because I know how sensitive you are to this issue and I say to you that for us Socialists and Democrats the granting of market economy status to China is premature under the current conditions. On Brexit, I repeat what I said when we were faced with grexit risk. We Socialists and Democrats will do everything we can to keep britain in the European Union. We want to help our British fellow citizens stay in the Eu ropean Union, but Cameron too must contribute clearly and constructively to the successful conclusion of the negotiations.  Mrs Weber is right, no fatalism and no resignation, the European Union is not a pile of rubble, but the problems are there and we must not put our heads in the sand. The way to really give a decisive value to 2016 is to act. We can solve these problems if we stand together, Parliament and the Commission, as we have done even more in recent months, and together with us the genuine leaders who are also there at national level who love Europe. This alliance together with our citizens can save the European design.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, for every single one of this week’s Summit items there is no simple answer, no simple soundbite, no one policy, no one Council conclusion to solve all the crises facing Europe. And far too many people offer simplistic responses: some speak of more Europe; a single EU intelligence agency; a single European army leading to a single European government. Others speak of no Europe: closing our borders completely; no entry; no migration, no cooperation. And sometimes the only voices that appear to be heard are those of the extremes. And our politics is in danger of becoming more polarised at a time when our world becomes more complex.  But these crises, they transcend the 140 characters of a tweet – do not tweet that, by the way. The migration and refugee crisis has no simple answers. There is no silver bullet. It must be tackled at source, and we must work our way to a political solution in Syria, however slowly and however frustrating that is. Not everyone who is coming here is necessarily fleeing war, but understandably seeking a better life. Who can blame them? But we simply cannot offer everyone a home, regardless of their personal circumstances. We must have clear rules in place to grant asylum to those genuinely fleeing persecution, and to return economic migrants to apply through existing immigration channels. Instead, we see one large Member State sending out a message that everyone is welcome – regardless of their personal circumstances or their reason for travelling – and then berating other Member States when they re-erect borders. We see other Member States not living up to their responsibilities to detain and process people. When they are unable to cope, they do not ask for help. So instead of all this we see kneejerk policies in the heat of a crisis, like a relocation scheme based on a simple idea but never really rooted in reality. Only 160 people have been helped through it to date. When reality bites, the rhetoric changes. So when Schengen states talk of re-erecting borders, we finally focus on strengthening the EU’s external borders with talk about a European border guard. Yes, we agree; enhancing Frontex and cooperating to help Frontex can help, but we need to be very careful about how what we agree now will work, not just for the next few months, but for the years ahead. And instead of compulsion over Member States, we need more cooperation between Member States, not using a crisis to undermine sovereignty. The same goes for the terrorism crisis we now face. We must react calmly and rationally with policies to address the threat. And yes, it is good to see some of our Member States are going after Da’esh in the Middle East, but we now need to build trust between Member States’ intelligence agencies to share data, not compel them. And we must also tackle the wider issues that lead young people to be recruited by Da’esh. The identity crisis that leaves young people vulnerable to the tactics of Da’esh will only be made worse if we seek to demonise or ostracise our Muslim communities in our countries. Now turning to the UK’s request that you reform, you may be surprised to hear that I have a few words to say about this. We all know that the majority of these requests could be accommodated relatively easily. There is some work to do to accommodate both the UK’s requests and to pursue further European reform. As a British Conservative, I am proud that it is a British Prime Minister who will deliver a referendum for the British people… (Interjection from the floor ‘Rubbish, it was UKIP!’) Dream on!  ...As a British MEP, I will help where I can with a renegotiation process and explain to colleagues here and to my voters, who will have the final say. But as leader of the ECR Group, I hope this process will act as a catalyst for EU-wide reforms. So looking at the Summit agenda, there are some tough issues that need some proper thinking and planning. 2014 was a year of a new European Parliament, a new Commission and a new Council President. But 2015 has been a year of kneejerk reactions. 2016 needs to be the year for laying the groundwork for long-term solutions based on cooperation.

One short film was on how Syrian refugees have been treated on the Hungarian border in recent months, and a second short film showed how Mr Trudeau, the Canadian Prime Minister, welcomed the 25 000 refugees who arrived in Canada a couple of days ago. I have to tell you that, if you look at the pictures next to each other, the difference could not be greater. It is even shocking. It is not the case that you can enter Canada without any problem. It is very clear that there are border controls in Canada, but the pictures show that they are received there in a decent way – in a human way – with compassion and not with fear or hate, by entering through a normal door and not on their knees under barbed wire, as in Europe.  So that is the main reason why, Mr Juncker, I fully applaud – and my group fully applauds – the Commission’s proposal to set up a European Border and Coast Guard to stop what is happening today, and to stop what is an insane competition between some Member States which, as in a game of ping-pong, are moving the refugees from one neighbouring border to another. It is also to stop the chaotic, not to say sometimes non—existent, management of some of our borders as, for example, in the case in Greece.  So I believe that your proposal is key. This European Border and Coast Guard is key because, without it, it could be the end of Schengen and it could also be the end of the European project. I even think that countries which do not want to participate in the European Border and Coast Guard – or are not willing to cooperate in this – have no place in the Schengen area.  So my plea to the European Council now – because the Commission has done its work – is to decide on it. You don’t do this. At any rate there is nothing about it in the conclusions – and the advantage for the Council is that they have already reached their conclusions before they meet with each other, that is the difference between them and the European Parliament; we meet and then we conclude; there they do it beforehand. In paragraph 2, they say that they are going to ‘examine’ it. Why is it not possible, Mr Schmit? Why is it not possible to decide that the European Council is in favour of a European Border and Coast Guard and then to start to examine – together with the two institutions and based on a fast-track procedure – the Commission’s proposals? No, it is not possible. It is ‘examine’. Well, I hope that you come back to debrief us on the European Council, together with Mr. Tusk, and that this will be changed in your conclusions, so that at least the principle of the Commission proposal is agreed to. That brings me to my second point: the fight against terrorism. Let me also say here that it is not your fault, I think that Mr Tusk’s services have prepared it, and the conclusions are completely weak. The only thing about the fight against terrorism is that on Thursday and Friday you are going to have enhanced information sharing. Then there are two pages about all the stuff on enhanced information sharing that you are going to do in the coming days. Well, we do not need enhanced information sharing. We need mandatory information sharing as fast as possible. That is my plea to the Commission. Is it not possible for the Commission to come forward with what I call a ‘horizontal mandatory sharing of information’ clause? You could do it by a regulation, for example. By horizontal, it means that it should apply to all databases that we process. That could be the Schengen information system, ECRIS, the Europol databases, the Frontex databases and the 28 new PNR databases. Why is it not possible for you to say in one regulation that, from now on, there will be a horizontal mandatory sharing of information flow between all these databases in Europe? That is my second point. My third and last point concerns the point made by Mr Kamall. I do not know whether he is playing Mr Jekyll or Mr Hyde, whether he is a British Conservative or the leader of the ECR group, on Brexit. My appeal, Mr Kamall, is to look at it in a positive, constructive and offensive, rather than defensive, way. In my opinion, it is an opportunity to reform Europe. So let us add to the four requests of the British Government all the in—depth reforms we desperately need in Europe: new governance for the eurozone, new tools for the geopolitical challenges we face. Why not a defence community? I agree with the British Prime Minister, Mr Cameron, when he rejects an ever-closer union. We do not need an ever-closer union. We desperately need a federal union – that is very clear – between the European Member States. That is what we need. So I agree with him.  Finally, to Mr Weber: it is true that there were good things in 2015 as well, and we have made progress, but for the sake of our health, let us make 2016 better than 2015 to make Europe great.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr Juncker, you rightly said earlier that it will never be easy in Europe, it has never been and will not be in the future. But I am convinced that if now – with a quick shot – the Member States are required to be prepared to renounce their sovereignty rights in order to establish a European external border protection authority and then also to be able to act against their will and then, at the same time, to hang on to those who do not agree with it, should not be entitled to the Schengen area, then I believe that this is not constructive and that this does not contribute to creating trust between the Member States. After all, the experience of recent years has meant that we often speak with a split tongue, that, on the one hand, declarations are made, demands are made, commitments are made, pressure is put on, we do not shy away from blackmailing Member States, and, in the end, even undermining their own constitution, in order ultimately to meet the demands of the EU institutions.  For me, that is the point where I ask myself the question: what are we actually doing now? Where did we get to? Are we really on the way to stabilising the European Union and the social, political and the whole situation? Or are we now running again with waving flags in a direction that leads us to encounter more and more contradictions among the people? I believe that it is primarily a question of advancing the common path. I would also ask you to stand up for this. I would also like to make it very clear to the Council during the Council meeting that the promises made at previous summits are kept. We are talking about the hotspots, which are about providing sufficient staff to operate them in the first place. I am thinking of Greece in particular. But it is also about the commitments that people who come to Greece or to the other countries will be distributed. If only 34 people have been brought to Luxembourg so far, what does it have to do with honesty? We cannot say on the one hand that Greece has to comply with the rules, we have to enforce measures, but we leave Greece alone in resolving the great refugee issue. When it comes to honesty, I am now also asking myself about what I have heard on the question of the accession process for Turkey, namely to keep it open. I was a we dismay to see who applauded. Representatives of parties that are members of the Federal Government have applauded for saying: we are in favour, we should tell the truth. We have no chance for the future. Why then do we sit down with you and agree on things that are supposed to solve the refugee issue, look away at what is happening in Turkey? We do not comment on the issue of dealing with journalists on the crimes committed in the Kurdish regions. We accept that the Turkish authorities are asking Syrian refugees to decide whether to go to detention centres or back to Syria. What is this? Why can we stand here and say: yes, we are asking for the next chapter to be opened or we are opening it up? But let us be honest: they will never become members of the European Union. I really wonder where we are? Are we playing honestly or are we really just trying to assert our own interests, those of the big ones? What happens as a whole, what happens to our values, our demands, our vision, our vision of a just Europe, a just European Union, is a wet sweep. Thank you, such a Union, I do not want that!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe still has at least one world championship title to defend, that of unfinished construction. We made a federal common currency without putting in place a federal government with a federal budget. We realize today that this does not work and we are therefore trying, in a hurry, to remedy these fundamental construction defects.  We have made a free movement zone for citizens to which we are extremely attached - as well as to the single currency - but without establishing a common management not only of borders, but also of migration and asylum policy.  So I was very honestly expecting - so I'm a little naïve, I know, the Greens are like that - that the Commission would yesterday propose a significant step forward that would allow us to remedy the problem. In other words, a step through which all of us, member states of the Schengen area, would decide to entrust to a European agency both the surveillance of our borders and the means that go with it - whether it is border surveillance, the reception and registration, of course, of asylum seekers and migrants, the fight against organised crime, especially against smugglers, rescue at sea. In short, this is what I expected.  Instead, we receive a proposal which is in fact to create a kind of emergency response body to help Member States overwhelmed by a wave of asylum or migration applications. Well, this is a situation that we obviously know and it seems to me quite natural that we should be able to go to the rescue of a Member State. But where the problem lies is that, when you read what is written in the proposal, you see that this force could be deployed in a Member State without it asking for it, but that it would be placed under its responsibility. Let me explain: a Member State would see a group of border police arrive at home who would take charge of border management without his request. Imagine for a moment that violations of European law and human rights are committed; it would be the responsibility of the Member State, which accepts this force against its will. There, it seems to me, is a fundamental manufacturing defect, which I believe is a serious offence to the most basic principles of law. So it's clear that your copy will have to be seriously reviewed if we want to make it something that holds up a little bit. In any case, Mr Juncker, I would like to remind you of one of your commitments that you have made repeatedly in this House: you have said that a legal path must be put in place - I say 'legal' - access to Europe. If you want to put an end to the smugglers' business, if you want to stop these permanent tragedies at sea, you need a legal path. And I didn't find it in what you proposed. In any case, the answer cannot be - and I would like to see it not forgotten - that of President Tusk, who, with his finest pen, wrote ten days ago that, in fact, one could perfectly envisage the imprisonment of asylum seekers in Europe for 18 months. Indeed, when you compare his attitude to that of your Liberal colleague Trudeau in Canada, you see that there is more than a nuance. I therefore find this attitude unacceptable and unworthy on the part of the President of the European Council and a member of the EPP. Finally, it is true that - I repeat Gabi Zimmer's comments on Turkey - you have the art of making the carpet in front of our friend Erdogan, this new Putin of the Sublime Gate. It's still amazing that we go to make salamalecs in front of a guy who imprisons his journalists, who dismisses his policemen and judges when they do not do what he asks them to do, who personally pursues journalists and attacks them in front of what is left of the justice system in Turkey, and who starts to wage a war against his own people, all because we want him to keep as many refugees as possible at home, I find that unworthy. I would like to make one final point. We have an agreement that we welcome, which took place in Paris last week, and I would like us not to underestimate its importance because in Europe we think that we have always been the leaders. What I see is that all the European policies adopted here have been based on the idea that climate change should be limited to two degrees - by the way, they do not even succeed. However, what has been granted to Paris is well below two degrees and as close as possible to one and a half degrees. This therefore calls for a review now - I say now - of the policies adopted by the European Union, in order to achieve the objectives we have set for ourselves.

It is funny, every single time a European Union policy fails, and that is pretty often, the demand is for more centralisation and ‘more Europe’. And by any measure, the EU’s common asylum policy – albeit given rocket boosters by Chancellor Merkel – has been a dramatic failure. Not only will millions continue to come, few of whom, of course, would qualify as genuine refugees, but it has become an open invitation to terrorism. So our solution is that the EU border agency and the EU maritime services should be given powers and the ability to declare force majeure over the Member States! Incredibly, the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, is supporting this. Yet that is the same Prime Minister who is going to have a meeting with you tomorrow night to talk about our so-called renegotiation. I hope he fares better than last time. The last time he attempted this he got to speak at one o’clock in the morning, spoke for a total of seven minutes, in the middle of which the French President, Monsieur Hollande, got up and went out for a pee. So I hope they take him a bit more seriously this time, though I sense that nobody in this room is exactly quaking in their boots. After all, he has asked for almost nothing, and he is unlikely to even get that. However, I am sure we will be treated to the usual theatricals. A grave-faced Prime Minister will come back to Britain to say how tough the negotiations have been but that he will not give in, and there will be hints that, perhaps, the Prime Minister will even support Brexit if he does not get his way. I think we should take that about as seriously as when he banged the table and said he would not pay the GBP 1.75 billion surcharge 18 months ago, and then meekly obliged. In February the charade will come back: there will be a European summit and, on something minor and inconsequential, there will be a deal, and a referendum will happen in June 2016. Opposition to this project is growing right across the continent: 15% of the Hungarian population have now signed a petition against migrant quotas. We saw an extraordinary advance by the French National Front in the elections in France last week, but so far nobody has reached the tipping point. Well, the British referendum may be that moment, and the momentum is on our side. It is not just about getting back national democracy: it is about getting back national self-confidence. For those of us who believe in nation-state democracy, 2016 is a very bright dawn indeed.

A few weeks ago David Cameron published his agenda for negotiation. It is an agenda without ambition and very far removed from his stated aims for renegotiation in his Bloomberg speech of 2013. Back then he promised opt-outs from EU legislation, control over migration, curbs on the European courts and, fundamentally, he demanded treaty change. Today he has limited himself to so-called changes that merely reflect the status quo and a vague demand for greater competitiveness within the single market. His proposals around benefit uptake have met with fierce resistance. So is this Union up for negotiation? Are the European institutions capable of change? Or as many of my constituents believe, are we simply left to pay the bill while having our concerns ignored? It is a stern test for David Cameron. It is an even bigger test for Brussels, and the scant reference to this in both the Commission and Council contributions this morning does not bode well.

But just because the focus has changed doesn't mean the crises are gone: they're all there, they're all together. And while some of them apparently do not concern us as dramatically as in the past, the economic and employment crisis, however, remains the main concern of European citizens.  Firstly, because of the legacy of the crisis itself: in terms of unemployment — it is going to be extremely serious for young people and long-term left-handers — in terms of social and territorial divergences and also in terms of loss of labour rights and wage conditions. But it's not just about the legacy. The present: our growth is weak, it is around 1.5%, half as much as in the United States; our unemployment is high, it's around 11%, twice as high as in the United States. And we are not preparing for the future either: our investment gap remains very high. The year 2015 has meant less than 2014 and 2014 less than 2013. We must therefore assume that while we do not face an economic crisis dramatically, it remains important. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission a question, to which I express my support: is it true that, after the September and November summits, at which 160 000 relocations were agreed, only one hundred have been implemented?

They talk about immigration crises when it is refugee crisis – the biggest crisis since World War II – and refugees flee wars, in which we have a great responsibility to pursue other people's interests that want a destabilized Mediterranean or a burned Mashreq.  This crisis is not solved by raising the walls of the fortress; it is not solved with a superpolycy above nation-states. It is not solved by rewarding partners, such as Turkey, who use refugees as a weapon; that allow the smuggling of oil from the Dáesh; invading a country like Iraq; bombing kurds and Kurds; or that, under NATO's umbrella, provocations are allowed against a neighboring nuclear power like Russia.

I quote: ‘We, the EPP Group, believe that the Nord Stream 2 agreement is not in line with the EU strategy of diversification of sources of supply and routes of transit of imported energy, as well as the EU’s energy security strategy and foreign security and Eastern Partnership policy goals, reinforcing the EU’s dependency on Russian gas supply’. My comment is this: Nord Stream 2 is being pursued by the Commission as a purely commercial project. My question is: if a project is negotiated in person by the President of Russia, Putin, and the Vice-Chancellor of a Member State, is such a project purely a commercial one? The Commission considers that Nord Stream requires only a legal analysis. This is fundamentally wrong; it is a geopolitical project that can be detrimental to our security.

Schengen is at stake, countries are introducing enhanced border controls. It pains me to monitor the construction of a fence on my country's borders, people-to-people relations are strained, distrust and intolerance grow. And all because in Slovenia, too, the belief prevailed that we are left to ourselves and that we will not be able to handle a new wave of newcomers from the Balkan route. We need clear commitments from leaders at this week's summit. The countries of the Western Balkans will not be able to provide support to the pressure of refugees for no longer. Additional financial assistance will be needed. We must be aware that more than 2 million refugees remain in Turkey and that, for now, there is no end to the conflict in Syria.  We urgently need to improve the management of the Union's external borders, helping not only the countries along the Balkan route, but the preservation of the Schengen area. And that must be our advantage, not the dangerous attempts to create a mini Schengen that will break europe. Freedom of movement is a symbol of our integration.

Maybe because we are still unable to find a common denominator to identify that most important topic. Which one: refugees, a planned referendum in Britain, or maybe euro zone affairs and its recession, or maybe the situation in Syria, maybe ukraine, the fight against terrorism, the management of the migration crisis, relations between the European Union and Russia, the development of the NORDSTREAM pipeline or the UK's proposals for reform of the Euro Union.

It is clear that what we are facing today is blowing up the bench, because it is a social model. I understand that so many people in the world can aspire to this model, but if we risk not being able to support it for our citizens, you will understand that we cannot offer it with the most goodwill. So it is empty to chimera those expressed by those who would like to welcome everyone and open the doors to everyone. Unfortunately, we have to put in place rules that we have to decide that we only welcome those who really run away from war and control our borders.

We cannot give people the excuse that decision-making is complicated and that there are constraints in domestic policy; we must just act. I am very grateful that the Commission has finally done so. At the same time I was surprised to learn how weak our information system is on the borders of the Schengen area. We must improve it. We must have the available information and we must know who is in, and who is out. We must solve it smartly as soon as possible. As our Chair, Mr Weber, mentioned, we have a plan.

In the course of history we Europeans have been incredible at creating results. We are creative, we are adaptable, and, in the course of our history, we have also been very good at destruction and at killing each other. Nobody does it better than we do. And we have learned, after two failed attempts – fortunately – at collective suicide, that working together is a lot better than trying to do it on our own and looking for confrontation. This year has seen a perfect storm. On top of an economic crisis and a banking crisis, which had already eaten away at people’s self—confidence, came the huge challenge of the terrorism crisis, and, on top of that, the refugee crisis. No wonder that many Europeans are unhappy with the present situation.  But it is my profound belief that looking for solutions individually, at the expense of other Europeans, against other Europeans, is moving back to a part of our history I thought we had left behind us forever. We will only come out of these crises if we work together. That is the spirit with which the Commission has made the proposals. Are the proposals perfect? I do not pretend they are, but they are a positive step toward solving a problem at our borders. They are a positive step towards showing European citizens that we need to solve this together. If Member States have better solutions, better options, please put them on the table. We are not dogmatic about them. Let me say one thing to conclude. We need to do a better job of protecting our external borders. There is no contradiction between being Europeans and being protective of our external borders. We are a community of values based on solidarity, and solidarity is something that means that you stick together. It does not mean what I hear Ms Keller say, namely that we should have a European Union without borders. That is elitist populism. We cannot survive without borders. We have to select, at our borders, who has the right to international protection, and who does not have the right to international protection and should be returned to their countries. The only way we can maintain solidarity in our society for people who deserve international protection is to ensure that the people who get it deserve it. Otherwise, we will undermine even the support for those who need international protection. Let us be under no illusion about that.

As the draft conclusions of the European Council have been mentioned, I would say that if we implement all that is in this draft conclusions, if we adopt and implement it, we will have made great progress, real progress. And among these advances, what is crucial is to preserve both the free movement of European citizens and their security. European citizens want both. It is up to us to guarantee them that freedom and security. We need to accelerate the implementation of everything that has been decided, quickly and efficiently. It is true that the time is not for half-solutions, for half measures. But when we look back a few months, has Europe been immobile, has nothing been done, has nothing been adopted? No! Thanks to Parliament, we have a long list of achievements, progress, such as the NRL, data protection, the platform against illegal work, etc. So Europe is not immobile. But it is true that we have been caught off guard by this tragedy at our borders, by the crisis in Syria, by the migration crisis, and perhaps it is because we have forgotten that European integration is a response to the tragic dimension of history, the Vice-President of the Commission has, in a way, also recalled it : two world wars, an economic crisis, fascism, Auschwitz. We may have forgotten that history remains tragic, as Raymond Aron put it during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.

It is an extraordinary honour for me, on behalf of this year's Sakharov Prize winner Raif Badawi – who cannot be with us today because he has freely expressed his opinion and because he has called for freedom of thought, because he has been sentenced to ten years in prison and 1 000 lashes, and because we have received the dramatic news that he has now been placed in solitary confinement in an additional way. , and that is why he cannot receive the Sakharov Prize in person today – that is why it is an honour and a pleasure for me to welcome his brave and great wife – you, Mrs Ensaf Haidar – here in the European Parliament today in the place of your husband. Welcome! (Applause) Among the many guests who today give us the honour of attending this Sakharov Prize 2015 award, many representatives of the Diplomatic Corps, are two guests with us, whom I welcome equally warmly. I have agreed with Mrs Haidar that I am also offering this welcome on her behalf to Olga Schorina of the Boris Nemtsov Foundation and to Maria Alejandra Aristigueta, the representative of the Venezuelan opposition. These two groups were in competition. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to this award ceremony! (Applause) Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, for being with us. Through you, Mrs Haidar, we would like to honour your husband's courageous struggle. Mrs Haidar, I would like to pay you personally, your family, your children, all your friends, first of all in the dignity, courage and determination you have shown in the struggle to get your husband home, where three young children aged 12, 11 and eight are waiting for their father to return. Because of death threats, including against you personally, you had to flee with your children to Canada, where you were granted asylum and from where you wage your tireless fight for your husband's freedom, where you give him a voice while he is prevented from using his own voice. And that is why, on behalf of all of us here, I once again call on King Salman to pardon Raif Badawi and release him immediately and without conditions and to have him returned to his family. (Applause) Despite a high risk, Raif Badawi, as a blogger, bravely tried to promote free thinking. He has perceived nothing but his right to freedom of expression, and through his blog he has filled a gap, a gap in a country where there is a vacuum in a country where there is a vacuum for freedom of expression due to the lack of a free press. Raif Badawi raised his vote for the right, the human right, to express his opinion freely. He called for a society in his country that is open to the views of others. As he said to you from prison when he dictated over the phone the foreword to the book containing his collected writings: He is committed to enlightening his community and tearing down the walls of ignorance. Its aim is to question the inviolability of clergy in his country and to guarantee respect for freedom of expression and belief and to guarantee respect for women's rights and the protection of minorities and fundamental civil rights to each individual. With this in mind, Raif Badawi founded the Internet Forum \"The Saudi Liberals\" in 2006 to discuss publicly the need for reforms at the religious, cultural and political levels in a discussion forum. Two years later, the government forced him to close the forum. But he hasn't given up. On the contrary, he came back with a new Internet forum, the \"Free Saudi Liberal Network\". This network had tens of thousands of members discussing religion and politics. And when the so-called Arab Spring appeared in the region, there was a lively debate in this network and on this platform. The closure of Badawi's website was a great loss for freedom of expression in his country. He wasn't just censored. We all know that he was imprisoned, and he received the first 50 lashes in the face of a roaring crowd. His flogging shocked the whole world. Everywhere, people took to the streets and used social media – his tool – to condemn this cruelty. After international ostracism and poor health Raif's further lashes were provisionally suspended. Raif Badawi has become a symbolic figure and an inspiration to all those who fight for fundamental rights not only in the region, but far beyond the world. Indeed, Raif Badawi is not alone in this fight. His own lawyer, Waleed Abu al-Khair, 36, is serving a 15-year prison sentence. As the founder of the Observatory for Human Rights, he was convicted, among other defendants, of tweets denouncing human rights abuses. In October this year, Dr. Abdulkarim Al-Khodr, co-founder of the Saudi Association for Civil and Political Rights, was imprisoned as the tenth founding member of the organization. He was sentenced to eight years in prison and a 10-year travel ban. Just a few weeks ago, Ashraf Fayadh, a young poet and curator of exhibitions, was sentenced to death for apostasy, a renunciation of faith. His trial was denounced worldwide for the lack of a fair trial and a lack of legal assistance. Ali Mohammed An-Nimr is 21. He was not yet 18 years old when he was arrested for demonstrating for equal rights in Saudi Arabia. That is why he is sentenced to death with subsequent crucifixion. We are concerned and shocked by the reports that this sentence is to be carried out in the next few days. As we have done for Raif Badawi, in a European Parliament resolution we called on the Saudi authorities, and I do so on behalf of all of us here and in public: release Mr Ali Mohammed An-Nimr! Lift the death sentence! Look away from this cruel punishment! (Applause) These cases are just a few of the many cases of political prisoners subjected to inhumane treatment, humiliation and the death penalty. We now urge the Saudi authorities to put an end to the systematic repression of peaceful expressions of opinion and finally to comply with the many international obligations that the country has ratified: for example, the Convention against Torture – ratified by Saudi Arabia – the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women. The international community, as well as Saudi society, have the right to place higher demands on the Saudi authorities, as the country has been elected a member of the UN Human Rights Council. It has been stressed that the deplorable human rights situation certainly does not fit with the responsibility that the country has assumed within the framework of the United Nations. In the country that has become a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council, 150 people have been executed this year alone. The society in Saudi Arabia demands public communication: Saudi society has the highest number of active social media users worldwide. But the Internet is heavily censored, with 400,000 websites blocked alone. Worse still, those who use the Internet and social media to express their thoughts freely are severely punished. However, we are ready for dialogue, not only as the European Parliament, but also for the international community. A dialogue on human rights between the EU and Saudi Arabia, supported at parliamentary level, could help to improve the situation, promote mutual understanding and support reforms. Certainly, there have been some positive developments. The Council of Ministers has approved a law on private associations and organisations, which I hope will soon also allow non-governmental organisations to work in the country itself and to have unhindered access to civil society. There has been little progress on women's suffrage, but the country is a long way from equality for women. We are fighting for equality between men and women and against all forms of discrimination. And we call on Saudi Arabia to honour its commitments and finally abolish the male guardianship system towards women. This does not belong in the 21st century! (Applause) Mrs Haidar, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioners for their excellent work and for their excellent work. No terror, no criminal law that inhumanely, will prevent us from fighting for human rights. And no security argument, no arms deal and no oil trade must stop us from doing so. As Raif Badawi put it: \"Freedom of expression is the air that a thinker breathes, just as it is the fuel that ignites the fire of his ideas.\" Ladies and gentlemen, it is a special honour for me to receive the Sakharov Prize for Spiritual freedom of the European Parliament to Raif Badawi in 2015. And I very much hope that in the near future we will be able to receive him personally here in our Chamber.

It is an honour for me to be in your Hemicycle. It would of course have been nicer if my husband could have received the prize personally, but if I may, I would like to ask you to respect one minute’s silence as a tribute to those who lost their lives in France and elsewhere. What my husband would like would be a minute’s silence paying tribute to these victims. (The House rose and observed a minute’s silence) Honourable President, Members of the European Parliament, I stand today on solid ground in front of you, the representatives of the great European nation, to express my great honour at being here, firstly as a representative of my husband Raif Badawi, and because I am in the Chamber of the largest and most important forum for democracy in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, allow me to begin my speech with my husband Raif Badawi’s article: Freedom of expression is the air that a thinker breathes; the fuel that ignites his ideas. Through the ages, societies have progressed only through their thinkers. From among the ideas and philosophies available, people can choose their own way of thinking and use it to embark upon the seas of science, progress, civilisation and prosperity. Societies and human rights groups around the world call upon Arab regimes for greater reform in the area of freedom of expression, believing it to be a simple human right. You are a person, so you are entitled to express yourself and think however you want. You also have the right to say what you are thinking about, to believe, to love and to hate, to be a liberal or an Islamist. Arab thinkers, or at least those who are free thinking, have got used to camouflaging their ideas in order to get them through. Those ideas that are free and enlightened are considered blasphemous in the ideology adopted by Arab societies, in which every free thought is decadence and a diversion from the true path. Is this normal? Of course not. Both sides – Arab thinkers and society – operate outside the realm of normalcy. Thinkers should reveal their ideas with complete honesty and courage even if they contain mistakes, or if they go against the intellectual tide. And they must keep themselves open to listening to the opinions of others so that they can criticise them constructively in a creative dialogue that aims to develop their ideas, and not reject them simply because of a difference of opinion. Observers of Arab society can see overwhelmingly that it is reeling under a theocratic regime that will only hear the words ‘Yes, Sir’ spoken to its clergy. This society has undoubtedly mastered the art of displaying religious observance to the clergymen to the extent that their fatwas and interpretations of Islam have become absolute truth − even sacred truth. Yet as soon as a free thinker starts to reveal their ideas, you will see hundreds of fatwas accusing them of being an infidel just because they had the courage to discuss religious topics. I am really worried that Arab thinkers will migrate in search of fresh air and to escape the sword of the religious authorities. Raif predicted here, before his imprisonment, that the clerics constrain the thinkers just because they undermine their role, as they are living on lies and exhibit hypocrisy towards the public. Raif Badawi, a young Saudi man, has been in jail since 2012 on charges of insulting the Islamic religion. The first sentence passed against him was the death penalty for apostasy. In the past year he was sentenced to a cruel and inhuman punishment: 10 years in prison, a fine of USD 300 000 and 1 000 lashes which were set to be administered weekly in a public square, 50 lashes per week each Friday after prayers. In addition, he is banned from using any media outlets and from travelling abroad for 10 years after being released from prison. Raif is not a criminal or a rapist. Raif is a writer and a free thinker: that is all. Raif Badawi’s charge and crime are that he is a free voice in a country which does not accept anything other than the single opinion and the single thought. Raif has never been a criminal, thug or drug dealer, so the Saudi authorities should not be dealing with him as a criminal who deserves to be punished, flogged and jailed for a very long time. Raif is only a man who thinks and translates his thoughts onto paper. He dreams of a beautiful world and looks forward to it. He wants us to respect differences in a country where there is only single-mindedness, only one thought and only one religion. His thinking aloud annoyed them, so they created an icon of freedom of him, not just in Saudi Arabia, but throughout the world as well. Raif Badawi is just a Muslim thinker who refused to be part of the herd, following the clerics living outside time and governing by a law of injustice and tyranny. He was brave enough to raise his voice loudly to say no to their barbarism and insolence. That is why they flogged his frail body with their whips of ignorance. 50 lashes was sufficient to give rise to mass protests which still continue in Korea, Australia and even Canada, with everyone chanting ‘I am Raif’, despite their different races. Awarding the Sakharov Prize to Raif Badawi is a historic and noteworthy day. It is, Mr President, an act of bravery by you and by all those who voted for Raif beneath this great dome. This prestigious award is the 15th international award granted to Raif in less than a year. He is the first person from the Gulf Arab region to be awarded the Sakharov Prize. Ladies and gentlemen, let me thank all of you for this opportunity and this honour. And I will conclude with Raif Badawi’s words: ‘We want life for those who wish death to us; and we want rationality for those who want ignorance for us.’ (The House accorded the speaker a standing ovation)", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "S&D", "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 106, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Martin SCHULZ", "mepid": "1911", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent report, which I think I would like to thank Mrs Haidar once again on behalf of all of you. I had the opportunity to have a long conversation with Mrs Haidar before the speech. Ms. Haidar told me about her three children – a girl of twelve, a boy of eleven, and a girl of eight – waiting for their father in Canada. Mrs Haidar told me that every time Mr Badawi calls her, he asks a question: do the children not forget me? I believe that we can all understand what this means for a father, but also for a mother who, in these circumstances, has to make a phone call with her husband, who asks this question. She told me, no, I tell him that every time, the children don't forget you. No one forgets you. Our ceremony today was a contribution to the fact that the children also know that the Father is not forgotten. We fight for him. And To you, Mrs Haidar, I think everyone in this room admires your great courage. Thank you for your speech.

It is not permissible to underestimate the consequences of the economic fragility that imbalances in a non-harmonised banking sector can produce, and the maximum cohesion of the three supervisors must therefore be guaranteed, in order to support the creation of the single body of rules in the banking sector in order to ensure a level playing field and high protection for depositors, investors and consumers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Matt CARTHY", "mepid": "124986", "text": "   in writing. – I voted against the extension of the term of office of the Chairperson of the European Banking Authority as I have grave concerns with the EBA.

The European Parliament's ECON Committee only held a hearing of the candidates, and then voted last week to renew the mandate for all three by a very large majority. We voted against, firstly because of an almost automatic method of renewal with no real reasons; Moreover, the role and value of these authorities has so far proved to be rather marginal, and therefore to continue in the path of five unsatisfactory years certainly does not seem the best decision that could be taken.

In some cases, the expansion of this range of species did not bring any specific problems, as other native species were not endangered, but in a number of situations the result was completely the opposite. One of the most significant negative examples is the rabbits in Australia and the enormous damage they have done to the local ecosystem over the last few centuries. Drawing up a list of invasive alien species and realising the relevant counter-actions at European Union level is an undeniable step, as there are many such species, such as the same round seagoing minutiae, whose natural range is in the Black, Azov, Marmara and Kaspian Seas, rather than in the Baltic Sea. The biggest problem is that the round seagoing mink eats clams that filter and purify the water. By reducing the amount of bivalve molluscs, it contributes to the flowering of algae and lack of oxygen in the affected waters. As a result, other fish species die in huge quantities, while others, such as cod and perch, are becoming increasingly dangerous for human consumption. Unfortunately, the European Commission failed to put forward a sufficiently high-quality draft regulation in this case.

Accordingly, the safety of gm products should be ascertained before authorisation. A wide range of experts objected to the aequisience of studies on the health safety of NK 603xT25 maize. The following deficiencies are identified in the risk assessment carried out: the safety of the NK603xT25 double modified maize line has been determined on the basis of data from single modifications. However, when examining agronomic and phenotypic characteristics, this genetically modified maize was different from its traditional pair.  Inexplicably, EFSA did not considered any of the significant differences to be such as to require further investigation. This and the disregard for the difference in the composition of seeds and feed were confirmed by the EFSA GMO Panel. It should also be criticised that longer-term animal feeding trials should have been carried out in order to determine that this product does not indeed pose a risk to human or animal health. In addition, the GM maize in question is resistant to herbicides with the active substance glyphosate. In the course of its cultivation, therefore, increased use of these plant protection products may occur, which will later increase the level of residues in the crop. It is also important to note here that in 2015 the herbicide glyphosate was classified as a \"likely human carcinogen\" by the WHO.

This has seriously distorted fair competition in the European Union&#39;s single market.

As diplomatic relations between the EU and China began in 1975, and this year marks the fortieth anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations, during which China is growing steadily as a global power, it is important to review European strategic priorities in relations with China. The partnership between the EU and China is essential for the identification of common interests, in order for bilateral cooperation to address common issues of interest. Some important global and common issues are global and regional security, the fight against terrorism and organized crime, cyber security, weapons of mass destruction and non-proliferation, energy security, global financial and market regulation, climate change and sustainable development.

The number of people in need has reached unprecedented proportions. So when we discuss ways to help, we can only think in comprehensive partnerships. My personal experience is that the Middle East is one of the focal points for assistance today. In the refugee camps in Iraq, I have found it confusing that the EU does not build on the capacity and infrastructure of local church communities and their aid organizations when carrying out projects. Recognized organizations such as Aid to the Church in Need have implemented projects in the area worth more than € 40 million. They have a total of 38 different programs running in Iraq alone and more than 100 in Syria. They successfully provide basic needs for hundreds of thousands, such as housing, education or employment. It is worth looking at these results because these are the two countries from which current immigration originated and are still heading towards Europe.

As the leading donor and key global player in humanitarian action, the EU has both a responsibility and the necessary leverage to take a leadership role in the quest for more efficient and effective ways to meet the needs of those affected by conflicts and disasters.

Obviously, it should not be forgotten that they are used by industries that have a high energy requirement and, therefore, a balance must be found that allows the industry to remain competitive without compromising energy policies and the reduction of atmospheric emissions.

The rapporteur points out that the problems of the EU industrial metals industry, such as low competitiveness and low investment attractiveness, are largely due to the emissions trading scheme and high European energy prices. Therefore, the transformation of the current emissions trading scheme is one of the most pressing issues to ensure the competitiveness of the industrial metals industry. European trade defense measures for industrial metals are characterized by too late a remedy rather than a prevention.

The rapporteur points out that the problems of the EU industrial metals industry, such as low competitiveness and low investment attractiveness, are largely due to the emissions trading scheme and high European energy prices. Therefore, the transformation of the current emissions trading scheme is one of the most pressing issues to ensure the competitiveness of the industrial metals industry. European trade defense measures for industrial metals are characterized by too late a remedy rather than a prevention.

Relatively high energy prices and the cost of CO2 emissions severely limit the competitiveness of the European industrial metals industry on the global market, and this competitiveness is not improving for the very few investments in the European industrial metals industry for the same reasons. The report cites the steel and aluminum industries as two significant examples of difficulties in professions that should be involved in their energy renewal and environmental modernization in parallel. This, in turn, would require an investment policy that few of them have the resources for today. He considers the reuse of industrial metals and the development of a circular economy to be absolutely vital, but points out that recycling alone will not be able to meet the future demand of Europe, which has embarked on an energy transition.

It is these movements that we are witnessing in the worst possible way, sympathizing with the workers at the Sisak ironworks.

The rapporteur points out that the problems of the EU industrial metals industry, such as low competitiveness and low investment attractiveness, are largely due to the emissions trading scheme and high European energy prices. Therefore, the transformation of the current emissions trading scheme is one of the most pressing issues to ensure the competitiveness of the industrial metals industry. European trade defense measures for industrial metals are characterized by too late a remedy rather than a prevention. European trade policy cannot ignore the fact that these third countries take advantage of their comparative advantage in terms of access to raw materials, often receive state aid and sometimes sell their products at prices below production costs.

However, it is also important to denounce the hypocrisy of the EU which, in this matter, has been building a policy for migration that, in practice, is based on repressive measures that end up at the root of all this humanitarian drama that the world is witnessing and that they demand measures that this EU clearly has no political will to take.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 1842, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Harald VILIMSKY", "mepid": "125001", "text": "written.- With its effective border protection, Hungary has proven that this is possible.Hungary should be seen as a trailblazer, but the motions for resolutions take an anti-Hungarian stance.Therefore I reject them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 1843, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Sotirios ZARIANOPOULOS", "mepid": "125090", "text": "NI), in writing. - The KKE MEP condemns the reactionary and anti-popular policy of the Hungarian bourgeois government which targets refugees, immigrants and attacks workers' rights and freedoms in order to serve the interests of the monopolies.

I strongly believe that interinstitutional dialogue is essential for increasing the effectiveness of external action to promote respect for human rights and the democratic principles of the Union in third countries. In this interinstitutional dialogue, but especially in communication with citizens, the report I have written and negotiated with other political groups aims to explain Parliament's vision of how the European Union has promoted human rights and democracy. in its external relations in 2014. I also took the opportunity to explain Parliament's vision of the steps the Union should take to improve its foreign policy on human rights and democracy. In the following I will dwell on several aspects of the report, a very broad one, with more than thirty pages. One of the key messages that the report conveys is that the time has come to focus on implementing the European Union's human rights and democracy policy. Over the last four years, the Union has developed a number of instruments to promote these values, inter alia in response to numerous calls from the European Parliament. We currently have a very good strategic framework that guides the actions of the European Union. A second action plan was adopted this year, which translates into action the axes set out in the strategic framework. The Union regularly organizes human rights dialogues with third countries, as well as political dialogues, in which rights are addressed. The Union has, again as a result of numerous requests from Parliament, a very good special representative for human rights. The Union also developed strategies for the promotion of human rights for each country, and delegations set up coordination centers for the same issues. We have an enlargement policy that promotes rights, just like the recently revised neighborhood policy. It is time, I think, to use all these tools effectively to maximize their impact on respect for human rights in various third countries. We must have the courage to fully assume the objective set out in Article 21 of the Treaty, which is to place the protection of human rights at the heart of the Union's external action. In this regard, we have proposed in the report some courses of action that can be followed. Among them, I think it is essential to allocate sufficient resources to human rights and democracy policy. Resources can be used, among other things, to support those who fight every day for respect for democratic values ​​and rights and principles in third countries. In this regard, I welcome the new support mechanism for human rights defenders working in risky contexts, announced a few days ago by Commissioner Mimica. A second key message I wanted to convey is that supporting and promoting democracy in external relations must not play a secondary role in Union policy. On the contrary, I believe that respect for democratic principles and human rights go hand in hand and can hardly be thought of separately. I have also drawn attention to the fact that, in order to truly promote democratic principles, the Union cannot limit itself to observing elections in third countries, although this is certainly an important tool for promoting democracy. In conclusion, I would like to return to the interinstitutional relations we were talking about, as well as the communication with European citizens.

As your report states at the outset, Mr Preda, human rights and democratic freedoms are increasingly under threat in many parts of the world. Defending human rights is becoming an ever harder challenge for all of us, in particular, promoting and helping to protect a healthy space for civil society organisations. We are confronted with unprecedented global challenges, with instability and conflicts just beyond our borders, and with a humanitarian crisis even within our borders. Terrorist attacks were brought into the centre of our cities, and they are posing an ever—growing challenge to our free and open societies. However, while the years ahead will continue to be challenging for the European Union, our approach cannot change. We need more equality and more human rights, not less.  To defeat terror, we surely need to improve law enforcement tools. But, at the same time, we need to work harder to secure inclusion. While we need to address conflicts at the roots of the immigration crisis, we also need to build inclusive societies and equality of rights. While receiving asylum seekers and migrants, freedom of expression remains the most powerful weapon against radicalisation and terrorism.  Mr Preda, honourable Members, your call for placing human rights and democracy at the heart of the EU external relations will not go unheard. The protection of human rights is, and will remain, one of the major priorities of our external action, and it is the foundation that defines all our relations with third countries.  This is precisely the rationale of the EU’s second Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy, which the Council adopted just five months ago. This new Action Plan shows the common will of the EU, not just of the institutions, but also of the 28 Member States together: to continue and enhance their global efforts on defending and promoting human rights and on mainstreaming human rights into all EU policies. This includes development cooperation, migration, counterterrorism and trade.  The Action Plan puts high on the agenda the promotion of gender equality also, women’s empowerment and women’s and girls’ rights. It will serve to measure coherence and coordination between our internal and external policies. Overall, it outlines our priorities on human rights in external action and details our strategy for the years to come.  The Action Plan gives a very special focus to empowering local actors and civil society organisations in an increasingly challenging landscape. We need civil society organisations to play an active role in the lives of their countries to the benefit of everyone. During the last years, efforts to bar, restrain, or control the work of civil society organisations have been frequent. Restrictive laws have emerged, imposing unjustified and complicated procedures for the registration of associations, or restrictions on their funding, in particular from foreign sources. Civil society organisations in our neighbourhood and beyond need our support more than ever. Just two weeks ago, we devoted the yearly NGO Forum, jointly organised by the EEAS and civil society, to the issue of protecting and promoting the space of civil society. Hundreds of NGOs attended and Federica Mogherini addressed the closing session. She conveyed the relevance that the Commission and the EU as a whole attach to the essential cooperation with civil society in the protection and promotion of Human Rights in the world, and within the European Union.  This was a first step in a long-term process of cooperation. The EU will continue engaging on this issue. Of course, the Action Plan looks at a number of other priorities. This includes a number of topics that you recall in your report and which we have many times discussed together. For example, we will continue to work on a responsible trade policy, or on promoting the EU agenda on business and human rights. We also want to make social and economic rights increasingly part of our human rights policy. And last but not least, we will use the full range of the policy instruments we have at our disposal. In this context, let me thank you again for the great and extensive contribution of your report.  Regarding proposals, suggestions and constructive criticism: these are of great value to us. As you suggest, we are working on improving our human rights strategies, making the human rights dialogues and consultations more result-oriented, and assessing the implementation of the guidelines. As regards the annual report, we have already advanced in making it clearer, more analytical and user-friendly from next year. I understand that you are also working on enhancing the EP actions on human rights. I very much welcome, for example, your work on reviewing the guidelines for the EP interparliamentary delegations. It is very welcome. Our work does not end, but begins, with the adoption of the Action Plan. Putting it into practice will be a living process where all actors will make their contribution. In that regard, you are, of course, our privileged partners. Our actions on human rights and democracy are mutually reinforcing. As just one example, I can mention the role Members of Parliament play as chief observers of election observation missions. Together with you are the other EU institutions, our Member States and our EU Special Representative Stavros Lambrinidis, who is sitting next to me and who is doing a great job. Thank you, Stavros. (Applause)  We all need to join forces and cooperate even further in pursuing the ambitious objectives of our Action Plan.

We made a strong connection between insisting on human rights, gender equality, good governance, peace and security, and the goal of eradicating poverty and inequalities as well as achieving the social development goals in the world. Moreover, we recalled that cultural diversity cannot be invoked for infringing human rights which are guaranteed by international law. Human rights must be at the core of our development agenda. We therefore stressed the need to ensure that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is underpinned by the human rights-based approach. We mentioned the importance of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. And we decided to strongly condemn, in the opinion, the use of  harmful practices on women and the use of rape as a weapon of war. Last but not least, we reminded the Commission and Member States that agreements concluded with developing countries must include binding clauses on human rights and that the Commission must conduct systematic human rights impact assessments of trade and investment agreements.

Today's ceremony of presenting the Sakharov to Mr Raif Badawi, or rather to his wife Haidar, how strongly she confirmed our - the European Parliament - strong commitment to human rights. At this point, I would also like to thank my colleague Cristian Dan Preda for continuing this path of annual and multi-dimensional reports on human rights in the world. I would like to point out that the main aim of the reports is to ensure coherence between the internal and external policies of the Union in the field of respect for human rights and democratic values, which is why we attach so much importance to this cooperation, which works between the European institutions and its delegations abroad to ensure that all these the institutions spoke in one coherent voice. I would like to welcome the adoption of the new Human Rights Action Plan up to 2019. The adoption of these five strategic areas represents a renewed commitment to a systematic and focused approach on human rights and democracy. I also want to highlight the human rights dialogue with third countries. It is an important tool that enables not only involvement and cooperation for the promotion of human rights, but also a significant change in many member states. Here I thank Mr Stavros Lambrinidis, who mentioned a number of countries at a meeting in the Subcommittee on Human Rights, where significant progress has been made. I would like to emphasize the importance of the issue of freedom of thought, conscience, religion and belief. It remains a constant challenge.

I hope that we all agree in considering the European Parliament's annual report on human rights not an empty and rhetorical ritual, but the fact that it represents an important moment of evaluation of the policies implemented by the European Union and of indication of what it is necessary to do for the future. Commissioner, we live in a time in which rights are indicated as a luxury incompatible with the economic crisis, with the reduction of financial resources, with free trade agreements, with the need for stability and the urgency of ensuring protection and security. to a public opinion increasingly lost and frightened in the face of the terrorist wave. But we must ask ourselves: when the promise of rights is not fulfilled or removed, what are we taking our leave of? We must be aware that when individual rights, civil rights, those concerning work, health, education are restricted, well, it affects the premises of a democracy. So, let's be clear, and let's try to say things for what they are, it is not the rights that are insatiable, it is instead the claim of the economy to establish which rights are compatible with it. Hence the reflection on rights takes us to the heart of a cultural discussion that goes beyond contingency and reveals how the references to the economic crisis or the new geopolitics have only made more evident a much deeper transformation and conflict concerning the very node in which we must look at the evolution of our societies and of global society itself. We have no doubts. Precisely in such difficult times, more rights are needed, not fewer rights, and the criteria for their distribution must be based on the obligation to make their implementation possible. Because the problem we have is not the excess of rights, but their denial, determined by inequalities, poverty, conflicts, discrimination and violence against women, which erase the very dignity of the person. Here a problem arises for us, a problem arises for our consistency. It would be appropriate to demonstrate that we are not afraid to affirm the rights towards anyone, that we do not profess excessive realism and that we do not have guilty hypocrisy on ourselves. To meet this challenge everywhere, there must be a great capacity on the part of the European Union to insist on these issues and truly demonstrate the necessary coherence; to win this challenge on rights and to win it everywhere and to affirm the fact that this context, which is the civil, democratic context represented by Europe, still has something to say in the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 1855, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Hans-Olaf HENKEL", "mepid": "124823", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, as a long-time member of Amnesty International I have to come to the conclusion that this Parliament can be the most effective advocate of human rights in the world. The Annual Report shows us that globalisation does not only send goods and money and investments around the world, but also values and good ideas. Today there are more democracies in the world than ever before. By the way, I do not know of any democracy which does not have a market-driven economic system implemented, and more countries than ever have abolished the death penalty.  However, let me be quite frank here today. In the course of the discussions with members of other political groups, I have come to the conclusion that some of them misuse human rights to ride their ideological hobby horses. What do the Raif Badawis in the prisons of the world think when they hear that this report elaborates on financial transactions and labour standards? What do they think when they hear that there are demands of social dialogues and labour standards, medical policies and climate change?  Of course, in the end, all committees of this House have dealt and deal with issues which have something to do with humans. But if the Subcommittee on Human Rights keeps on ever expanding the definition of human rights, then we might as well close down all other committees of this House. More importantly, we divide and divert the attention given to those who really need our engagement for human rights.

The rhetoric still needs to be put into practice, especially by the Member States. We must also avoid a relativism that we denounce elsewhere and refrain from favoring trade, including that of arms, over the universal values ​​of the declaration of the same name.

As every year, this annual report on human rights and democracy in the world 2014 and EU policies in this area is a comprehensive report that gives a good overview of the EU's many-faceted engagements. Keeping human rights in the heart, at the center of EU politics, is a guiding principle that is very often found in Commission and parliamentary papers. This is also an important alignment for all EU policies. However, looking back at 2014 and 2015, this principle seems to me to have become a bit stale. The images of desperate war refugees at the EU's external borders are too memorable, the refusal to accept refugees into the EU is too shameful. Even the High Representative Mogherini has warned that this could damage the EU's reputation for pursuing value-based policies. EU refugee and migration policy would do well to strictly adhere to international law and not to water down protection standards. As foreseen in the Juncker Plan, we must expand the possibilities of legal admission and, with generous humanitarian aid, alleviate the plight of the people in the refugee camps around the war zones in the Middle East and Africa. I would like to briefly address two subjects in the annual report in particular. There is the issue of sport and human rights, an issue of increasing importance, especially in view of the upcoming soccer world championships in Russia and Qatar and the Olympic Games in Beijing. It is good that we are talking about sport and human rights in the report and expressing our concern that some of the biggest sporting events are often held in authoritarian states with devastating human rights records. Major sporting events should be consistent with human rights. The assessment of the specific human rights situation in a country must be the decisive criterion for the award of a major event. It is very regrettable that there is no reference whatsoever in the European Union's new human rights action plan on sport and human rights. The final topic: the fight against impunity. The EU and its member states have long-standing and proven supporters of international law and, in particular, of victims' rights. This is shown, for example, by the support of the International Criminal Court and the guidelines for the promotion of international humanitarian law. Support for the International Criminal Court at the highest political level is more important than ever.

But to effectively protect human rights, it is still necessary to be able to identify real priorities, which is not the case with the European Union. Its 2014 report on human rights in the world indeed retains four false priorities, presented in point 4 as the major internal challenges of the Union, namely: the situation of the Roma, the treatment of migrants, LGBTI people and racism would be victims. The Union thus gives in, once again, to its immigrationist whims and to the LGBTI lobby. In my opinion, the real priorities lie elsewhere. It is first of all the fight against Islamist terrorism. Not to say so amounts to disrespecting the memory of the 130 victims of the Paris attacks. It is then about the fight against extreme poverty. Due to the economic crisis, there are more and more homeless people in Europe. In France alone, there are more than 30,000 homeless children, but who cares? The 2014 report also affirms that the Union places human rights at the center of its international relations. But why is she then making a pact with states like Turkey or Qatar, whose attitude is equivocal towards the Islamic State group? In reality, the Union exploits human rights for two reasons: first, to give itself a semblance of respectability and to try to make people forget that it is above all at the service of banks and international lobbies; then, to justify its enlargement policy, which is analyzed in point 46 of the report as \"one of the most powerful tools for strengthening human rights\".

Do you actually know that in Germany alone there are over 1,000 patriots in prison just because they have given their opinion? Well, Mr Badawi was imprisoned for ten years, but in Germany my friend Horst Mahler was imprisoned for ten and a half, twelve and a half years just because he freely expressed his opinion. His leg was amputated in the seventh year of his imprisonment because he was diabetic and did not have sufficient freedom of movement. In the spring of Greece, I was able to see for myself how seven national MPs for the Golden Dawn were imprisoned in a prison that was unworthy of Europe. To date, no charges have been served on these seven people. We are currently witnessing a party being banned in Greece. Does this have anything to do with freedom of expression?

In this regard, I particularly welcome the adoption of the ambitious Sustainable Development Plan for 2013, as well as the leading role played by the European Union in this process. It is now, of course, necessary to ensure that this program, its monitoring measures and its implementation are truly based on a human rights-based approach. That is why the EPP Club within the Committee on Development insists on guaranteeing the promotion of human rights through development policy. We insist that together with our partners we annually monitor the progress and results related to sustainable development goal no. 16 which promotes the building of inclusive societies based on respect for human rights and democratic principles. It is this sustainable goal that must be the priority of our foreign, and thus development policy, and that is where we need to focus funds from the European Development Fund and the Development Cooperation Instrument.

I really liked the Commissioner's speech, but I think it is very important that we take the appropriate decisions so that Mr Lambrinidis - whose task is recognized by all - can express himself in this House. It is time for us to change some of the very outdated mechanisms that we have; We would all be delighted to hear from Mr Lambrinidis who, as I say, is recognized by all and whose task is being essential to promote human rights in the world. Since Mr Lambrinidis cannot take the floor, I will repeat a phrase that I have heard him these days: 'no one will respect Europe if we only care about money'. I think that phrase by Mr Lambrinidis pretty much sums up what many of us want to express. The problem, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, is that the very concept of the universality of human rights is in question at the moment. This is precisely why the European Union has to be stronger in defending this value. In many regions of the world it is questioned that the values ​​that we defend are universal values, and I believe that in this we cannot lower our guard. I believe that the world needs a strong and rearmed European Union more than ever in its defense of human rights. I also believe that it benefits us enormously to be energetic in the defense of human rights and democracy. Not all benefits are measured in millions of euros. There are many benefits that are measured in dignity, in political force when it comes to being consistent with what we think. If we don't really stand up for what we think, I don't really know what we're going to become. This has not been a good year. The disaster of managing the crisis of immigrants and refugees will remain on everyone's mind and in the history of Europe. I know that the European Union is not responsible. Rather, the Member States are, but in any case I believe that it is something that must be urgently corrected because it is very difficult to teach the world lessons if one is not able to even set an example in one's own space of responsibility.

Our main focus in the European Union should be to continue to stop people from being tortured, unjustly imprisoned or executed and to intervene in countries run by extreme and brutal dictators, not to constantly push the limits of the definition of human rights to include less significant economic and social dialogues. Increasingly, the human rights concept is being extended and linked to the larger context of interdependence with other domains of EU activity and ambition, including things such as trade negotiations.

As we speak, in Europe today refugees and asylum seekers are treated and talked about in inhumane ways. That does not do justice to the painful lessons we have learned in history or to the promise this continent has for the next generation. Human rights are too often treated as a soft issue while I believe it is in our interest, and of course it is our responsibility, to be a beacon for those who are facing repression, intimidation, violence, torture or even death.

Nearly 40 years ago, back in 1966, an agreement was reached between my country and the United States relating to the Chagos Islands in the British Indian Ocean Territory granting America a military lease on the island of Diego Garcia. This led to the forcible removal of inhabitants from the archipelago. Many Chagossians were sent to Mauritius; some came to the UK. They had no choice. None have been allowed to return. Their case has as yet been unsuccessful before the British courts and the creation of a marine protection area (MPA) in 2010 has further complicated matters, despite the court of arbitration ruling that this MPA breaches the rules of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. I support the desire of Chagossians to return to their home, especially as definitive studies have underlined that they could re-establish an economically viable community away from the main island and military base of Diego Garcia. It seems that, for once, we can ‘have our cake and eat it’.

The international community has made great progress in this area, but there are still serious setbacks, violations and difficulties. Today's globalized world and new technologies facilitate the dissemination of information on the situation of human rights, their violations and the defense of those who promote these rights from civil society, often in very difficult situations.

I was going to focus my speech on the importance of making full and proper use of all the instruments that we have in the European Union to advance human rights and democracy, but I cannot help but draw attention to paragraph 114 of this report, in which In an extemporaneous and unjustifiable way, surrogacy is condemned, practically comparing it to prostitution, sexual slavery or even organ trafficking. I ask all groups to vote against this section because, gentlemen, surrogacy is simply a form of in vitro fertilization that allows many citizens to access paternity when they cannot do it by other means. In Europe, this practice is legal in some countries and not in others. In some, it is allowed altruistically; in others, their citizens have to travel abroad if they can afford it. Here, in this report, we talk about Union policies to guarantee human rights and democracy, and the political coherence that concerns us implies, as established by the European Court of Human Rights, that children born by surrogacy are recognized and legally registered and are not subject to discrimination on grounds of birth, as established in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in its article 2. Therefore, we must harmonize the legal frameworks of States to protect the rights of their citizens, with children always first And that is what for me this report must guarantee: that we do in political coherence what we are called to do.

And then we have two misaligned hands, the words or the prizes we deliver, like the Sakharov Prize this morning, and on the other side there are our trade policies which is the real aggressive policy of the European Union and they continue to do big business with the sheikhs and argue quite the opposite of what we say here.

At these critical moments, what the European Parliament has been calling for for several years needs to be reiterated. In matters of human rights and democracy, the Union and its Member States must speak with consistency and unity. We therefore need to improve the coordination and coherence of our policies. Otherwise, we risk not only losing credibility, but also losing the fundamental values ​​on which the European Union is built. I am glad that this report mentions the means and instruments of the European Union's external policy. We must use them as effectively as possible. Especially when it comes to our close neighborhood. It is clear that the deteriorating human rights situation in our immediate vicinity has very specific negative effects on the EU. The migration crisis is one of the manifestations of this situation. We need to pay more attention to these issues and fully involve them in our relations with our partners. Recently, there has been a tendency to distort and underestimate human rights in many regimes, including in Europe. In these cases, we should express a clear concern. Indeed, when institutions and international agreements begin to be underestimated, the essence of the fundamental values ​​that we follow in Europe is also underestimated. Our priority must be to promote and strengthen democracy in the world and in Europe as a whole. It is important that we continue to support freedom of expression and strengthen civil society, as well as giving direct support to human rights defenders.

As far as the Mediterranean is concerned, the indifference and stingy side of certain Member States are not unrelated to the tragedies that have occurred there. However, there are texts to which all the Member States of the European Union have subscribed and which make it necessary for us to come to the aid of people in danger. Among these texts, let us quote the Geneva Conventions, which oblige us to grant the right of asylum to those who have no other solution than to flee terror and barbarism. Consequently, it is not the texts which miss, it is on the method that it is necessary to look. Member States which refuse to accept refugees on their territory or those which cannot speak of anything other than an upper limit in matters of reception are failing in their obligations, dishonoring politics, not to mention the fatal blow they risk to bring to Europe. Rights and solidarity go hand in hand in matters of immigration and reception of refugees. The codification of rights in this area will remain a dead letter as long as there is no shared desire by all to side with the weak. Everything therefore invites us to do our examination of conscience before lecturing the rest of the world.

We have examples of the failure of such an approach in the states of North Africa, where the effect was devastating, but also in the eastern neighborhood of the European Union. We need to understand that we can be more effective, including from the perspective of human rights support measures, if we approach this relationship with third countries on the basis of common interests, but at the same time taking into account what differentiates us.

Next, I would like to emphasize six essential elements for me. First, I will insist on consistency, on the one hand, between our various external policies and, on the other hand, between our internal and external policies. We must avoid having two weights and two measures and this consistency can only be reinforced by the full support of the Member States to the action plan and the strategic framework of the Union. My second point concerns the unity and visibility of the Union's action, facilitated by the work of the Union's special representative for human rights. This mandate must become permanent in order to complete the process. Third element: the role of electoral observation missions. Once again, the follow-up of these missions is essential. And I think this is the case even when the conclusions of the mission are positive, because it also constitutes political support for those who are determined, in their country, to advance democracy. Union delegations can take an even more active part in this monitoring. Fourth element: the role of parliamentary cooperation through delegations and joint assemblies, which provide significant support to countries in democratic transition. The fifth element deals with human rights, democracy and development. I would like to highlight the need to define a limited number of priorities per country, which could be a strategic and pragmatic approach to better achieve and quantify our results. Finally, the treatment and situation of migrants and refugees, including in Europe, is rightly included in the report. Let us not forget that in addition to terrorists and armed groups, migrant smugglers and criminal networks for trafficking in human beings willfully violate human rights. The smuggling of migrants is a crime and a violation of human rights.

We also keep in mind that 60 million people are on the move. The refugee-migrant crisis is one of the biggest problems in this context. We saw how many human rights violations there were.

We must preserve this identity of ours and not back down from our principles in the face of various authoritarian regimes or terrorist organizations. Our values, on which respect for human rights is fundamental, are now being called into question, and it is therefore necessary to invent new strategies and allocate sufficient money to promote them. Human rights need to be promoted in the world through targeted strategies, these strategies properly evaluated and then the consequences drawn and, where appropriate, strategies adjusted. It must be made clear at all times that human rights, such as freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, freedom of religion, are a precondition for the provision of development aid.

Then, for the first time in history, the right to life, liberty, security was recognized and we consider this date a turning point in modern history, because the world united to put an end to the genocide that took place during World War II. Unfortunately, many countries quickly forgot what they had signed, which is what the wars in the second half of the 20th century are all about. But it was not only the suffering of the war that called into question the essence of this Declaration. Both the economic collapse and the financial crisis that hit the world a few years ago have raised the issue of human rights again. These are all unavoidable topics that we encounter on a daily basis. So I want to thank Mr. Predi who is continuously working on this report and who has made one solid report for 2014. We are witnessing a large number of refugees fleeing their homes due to violence and the poor economic and political situation, all in order to find refuge. It is these situations that can be easy prey for human rights violations. I express my concern and solidarity with the large number of refugees and immigrants who suffer serious human rights violations as victims of conflict, in networks of illegal immigrants, in human trafficking, etc. I believe that we urgently need peace, security, sustainable growth in all countries, free and fair trade poverty rates and the protection of human rights, and I emphasize in particular the rights of children under the United Nations Charter, but also the protection of women's rights, which we should not forget in this situation.

I strongly believe in the role of the European Union and its External Service as a guarantor of human rights in other parts of the world as well. We need a more incisive role of our institutions and humbly propose alternatives without being arrogant and proud.

I personally consider the human rights agenda to be one of the key agendas of the European Union. This agenda is as important to me as the development of the internal market or the other, say, economic benefits of cooperation between the countries of the European Union. Who but the European Union should guard human rights in the context of world peace and warn countries where human rights are not being respected that human rights are being violated. I consider it particularly important to have an international debate with third countries on fundamental human rights, that is, the right to life, health, dignity, but also on fundamental political rights, such as the right to free expression. After all, it has already been mentioned here several times today. As I said, I'm really glad that the material is on the table here today, I consider it balanced. I say this also because I am a Member of Parliament for the Czech Republic, where the first freely elected President, Václav Havel, considered the human rights agenda to be an important instrument of international politics and international diplomacy. As a lawyer and a former Minister of Justice, I consider one issue to be particularly important, and that is the issue of combating the death penalty. I am very pleased that this topic is mentioned separately here, that the fight against the death penalty has a separate chapter. It is very sad that, unfortunately, the death penalty has been increasing in recent years in the world and that the three largest countries where the death penalty is most commonly used, such as China, Iran and Saudi Arabia, are using it more and more, not less. It is worth criticizing Saudi Arabia, which is cooperating with the European Union but has done nothing in the field of humanity in criminal law, and the death penalty is being carried out in a medieval, particularly repulsive way.

Our credibility abroad as a champion of human rights depends on what we do here at home. If we do not guarantee the highest human rights standards in Europe, our external action will also become weaker. In this process, the role of the European Parliament is also vital. Mainstreaming human rights into all our external policies is an ongoing process, and despite progress made so far, we must continue with our efforts. Our new action plan is intended to go right in that direction. In this very strict time framework of only two minutes, I would like to say a few words about impunity. In our human rights dialogues and our country strategies, this is always systematically part of accountability. Most importantly, that the European Union is a strong supporter of the International Criminal Court, and this is very important.

I was happy, in particular, to see that many of them highlighted the need for consistency between our foreign policy and the internal situation of the Member States. At the same time, I have somewhat regretted the fact that some of our colleagues have started, on this basis, to enter into a debate of the internal politics of their Member States or, as is also often the case, to criticize this happening in some Member States. These issues are the responsibility of another committee, the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs. It is for this reason that we wanted to prepare this report, which represents an analysis of rights as an instrument of foreign policy. In the DROI committee, we do not carry out an analysis for which members of another committee are responsible. What better proof, moreover, than to examine this annual report on human rights just after the Sakharov Prize ceremony. This is a very good example of what we can do in our relationship with this country. I would also like to point out, in view of the interventions criticizing the fact that the report does not look at specific situations or countries, that it is not a geographical report, but a thematic report. We discuss very specific countries and cases at every plenary session in Strasbourg. It is good that our colleagues know that now. Better late than never! Finally, I am pleased with the remark made by my colleague Tannock who stressed that we have tried to be more rigorous in the definition of rights, because consistency, mentioned by several of our colleagues, has as a sine qua non intellectual consistency.

These groups also deserve special attention when dealing with burning issues such as migration or the situation of people living in refugee camps. We must work with the countries concerned to ensure that children and young people in refugee camps receive adequate education and that girls and women enjoy adequate protection. The final text also pays special attention to the issue of national minorities. Ensuring equality in practice between national minorities and the majority nation is essential.

We have shown our firm determination to act without delay to find effective, united measures that respect human rights. The policy pursued by the Council aims to combine all efforts with a view to preserving the rights of people in need of international protection and, at the same time, to improve the control of external borders and thus guarantee the security of people living in the country. Union territory. Respect for fundamental rights is at the heart of the Union's migration policy and of the common European asylum system. We must respond effectively to the humanitarian emergency and guarantee the right to seek international protection in accordance with our international obligations. As far as detention is concerned, the basic rule of international and European law is that a migrant, like any other person, enjoys the right to liberty. Retention can only be exceptional and not arbitrary. It is only justified for a series of specific reasons and in specific situations. These are described in detail in the instruments of the acquis on asylum and migration, and in particular the Return Directive and the Directive on the conditions of reception of asylum seekers. The Return Directive provides, as a general rule, that Member States may only resort to detention after other sufficient but less coercive measures have been applied. It is Article 15, paragraph 1. Any detention should be as short as possible and can only be extended as long as the removal arrangement, which should be carried out with all due diligence, is in progress. Likewise, the directive on reception conditions for asylum seekers provides, in article 8, that no one may be placed in detention for the sole reason that he is seeking international protection. Detention is only possible when necessary, and on the basis of a case-by-case assessment, if other less coercive measures cannot be effectively applied. In accordance with their international commitments and the rules of the European Union, Member States must guarantee the human rights of refugees and migrants, including the obligations contained in the directives. In the event that European legislation is not applied by the Member States, it would be up to the Commission, as guardian of the Treaties, to take appropriate measures. To improve the efficiency of the Union's return system, the Council has indicated on several occasions in recent months that the use of detention can only be a measure of last resort, and therefore cannot be put implemented only if other measures are not possible. In its conclusions of 9 November last, the Council decided that Member States, in cases of lack of cooperation on the part of migrants on their arrival in the European Union, could effectively take advantage of the possibilities offered by the The union. These may include coercive measures, including, as a last resort, detention for a period not exceeding what is necessary for the completion of the underlying proceedings. However, this is only possible if the authorities fully respect fundamental rights and the principle of non-refoulement. In the recent Council decision on the relocation of 120,000 people from Italy and Greece, Member States agreed that when a voluntary return is not possible and other measures foreseen by the return directive are not appropriate to prevent secondary movements, detention measures in accordance with the said Directive should be able to be applied urgently and effectively.In this context, I would like to point out that migrants do not have a choice of place of protection and that their full cooperation is required to make relocation work.Finally, with regard to the use of force in the context of taking fingerprints, I refer to the checklist published by the European Agency for Fundamental Rights, dated October 22, which should henceforth guide theaction of experts in the field.In conclusion, the subject of detention will remain an important question, the exceptional nature of which must be underlined, and we will continue to follow this question closely, especially since clarifications from the Court of Justice of the UnionEuropean Commission on this subject are expected shortly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 1941, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Nicolas SCHMIT", "mepid": "197428", "text": "Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission fully shares with Parliament the objective of ensuring the full compliance of our policies with human rights and human dignity. This was at the centre of the debate on the report on human rights and democracy, which was just discussed some minutes ago.  This is also a key concern when it comes to asylum seekers. Having said this, I turn now to the topic of the statement: detention and the use of force against asylum seekers. The rights to liberty and security of person are fundamental human rights. The right to asylum is also a fundamental right. In the past few months, as you remember, we have made a lot of effort to communicate, and deliver on all fronts, the fact that EU legislation has to be respected. This means the respect of all aspects of the asylum legislation.  In this context, as long as there was a prior non-refoulement and proportionality check, countries could refuse entry to individuals who did not express a wish to apply for international protection. As you also know, we make efforts to ensure the proper registration of migrants, irrespective of their status. This is a precondition for appropriately managing the flows and setting the rights and duties of migrants.  Let me clarify what EU law requires. With the recast directives on asylum adopted in codecision, the EU acquis contains clear rules on detention of asylum seekers that strike a balance between those rights. It is therefore essential that persons are only detained in full compliance with these rules. Detention can only be applied as a measure of last resort, and only after all alternatives to detention have been duly considered. We all agree that a person should never be detained for the sole reason that he or she is an asylum seeker. At the same time, when there is a significant risk of absconding, a Member State should place a migrant in detention where that is necessary and proportionate. Moreover, the Directive on Reception Conditions provides that the detention conditions of asylum seekers must fully respect human dignity and meet their needs.  Having a solid legal framework is only going halfway, though. The challenge now is to ensure the correct and coherent transposition and implementation of these rules. The Commission is closely monitoring the respect of Member States for the EU rules on detention. Member States had to transpose the Reception Conditions Directive by July 2015.  The Commission has sent letters of formal notice to those Member States that did not communicate the transposition measures. In addition to legislation, the Commission also pays attention to Member States’ practice in this area. The Commission has also provided guidance to Member States to facilitate the systematic fingerprinting of migrants. The aim is to ensure better management of migration flows, via a better implementation of the Eurodac Regulation, while fully respecting the fundamental rights of the migrants.

First of all, thank you very much for this brief overview. It is particularly important to me that there are a number of Member States in the European Union in which human rights vis-à-vis refugees or economic migrants are not adequately respected. Regardless of who immigrates, there is no reason to use excessive force or even for prison-like structures, some, as the UNHCR has called it, are even worse than is the case in prisons: no food, little to drink, no medical Supply, poor sanitary conditions, sometimes daily use of tear gas. This sometimes happens in Greece, it can be in Hungary, it can be in Slovakia, it can be in different member states of the European Union. I have to say: In spite of all the critical debates we have about who is entitled to immigrate and how, there has to be a proper way of dealing with the people who come to us. Then we can agree on procedures and discuss all kinds of issues. But these things must be guaranteed. When it comes to the obligation to register, it is certainly necessary to start the investigation very early on. Because especially with children and adolescents who come who have been misinformed by human traffickers, people are often afraid of registration and do not want to be registered under any circumstances, so that a very early education - also to protect children in particular - is absolutely necessary . There are dozens of children who have disappeared and who for this reason can quickly become victims of crime again, because in this defenselessness they are then exploited by organized crime and the like for sometimes the worst and most brutal purposes.

But the truth is that this is not the case: there are countries that have erected fences, there are countries that have aggressively welcomed refugees and there are countries that do not respect these rights and that apply some type of police violence; And the reason is not to mistreat those who are deprived of liberty at that time, but to send a message to those who want to reach those countries, a dissuasive message so that they renounce to request asylum in the countries where they are treated in this way . That is why we are debating here, and that situation we have to change. Dublin does not solve the problem. We all agree that new rules must be found to regulate this situation in a different way. What is certain is that humanitarian principles cannot be abandoned when it comes to protecting people who flee in some cases of war, because it can kill them, and in other cases hunger, which kills with the same or even greater intensity than the war itself.

The most flagrant example is the proposal made by the President of the European Council, Mr Tusk, who put forward the idea that all asylum seekers should be detained for 18 months to screen if they are potential terrorists. The most bizarre thing is that he does not seem to even realise that this would be completely against existing EU legislation. Let me say it again: the President of the European Council is proposing that all persons seeking refuge in Europe, fleeing war and persecution, from the smallest baby to the oldest man or woman, should be put in prison-like camps for a year and a half. Mr President, this equals the darkest periods in European history that we do not want wish to see again. I think that it is shocking to the point that I personally think that Mr Tusk should be asked to publicly apologise for this. In the media today we hear talk about refugees illegally entering the Union. This is a narrative that is not only dangerous, it is incorrect. It is not in any way illegal to enter a country in order to ask for asylum. This is a recognised human right in all of the EU’s Member States.  Now, if we were to work together we would be able to offer shelter to those in need, but instead of that, rampant nationalism has taken over the public debate.

I want to report abuses against refugees and migrants at the hands of the Bulgarian police. GUE / NGL has collected in the Balkans testimonies of beatings, extortion and shootings that have taken place in Bulgaria. Like Oxfam, Amnesty International or UNHCR, we saw cuts and bruises and even bite marks from the dogs that the Bulgarian police had prodded. We note the harsh conditions of the people who crossed Bulgaria, where they were forced to register their fingerprints, and later entered Serbia through Dimitrovgrad, where some also suffered beatings and extortion. There is a sinister pattern. These people are detained, sometimes they are beaten and the agents steal money and valuables from them. They are then transferred to places of detention with poor sanitary conditions and little water and food. I want to show you photos of a group of Afghans resting as they can in a forest and some of the few images that exist of a detention center in Bulgaria.

He wants to close the American borders rigorously to Muslims. His response to the attack in San Bernardino is to blame the supporters of a religion and denounce them all as suspects. We have our own Donald, the President of the European Council, Donald Tusk. And our Donald thought it necessary to give an interview in Europe's most influential newspapers in which he states that all migrants entering the Union must first be detained for 18 months in order to be thoroughly screened. He said it's not just about limiting the flow of refugees, don't underestimate the security aspect, international and European laws have an 18-month rule. You can and should detain migrants for as long as their screening lasts. In addition to displaying incredible ignorance, I am particularly concerned about the way Donald Tusk puts refugees and migrants here primarily as a security risk. The difference with Trump is not that big. Do you know where the real difference is between \"the Donald\" and our Donald? In contradiction! Trump got a reply. He was made clear in his own conservative circle that they did not speak in that party, that they did not accept stigmatizing remarks like this and that it was in violation of Article 1 of the US Constitution. Where were our leaders with their corrective comments? Why didn't I hear Cameron, Renzi, Hollande, Rutte? They should have said: Donald, you're setting the wrong example. That's not how we treat refugees and that's how we spread fear among our population. Mr President, you know the law, I know the law, the Commissioner knows the law, Mr Schmit knows the law.

Now, while some of those may be genuine asylum seekers or refugees, it is not yet possible to identify and confirm those who are masquerading as such. Dictated quotas, unreasonable deadlines and relaxed processing systems to resolve the resettlement logjam have only exacerbated the problems caused by Mrs Merkel’s ill-judged siren call, and the United Kingdom media and press have covered the instances of German and Swedish communities overwhelmed by resettled migrants, with stories of arson, street violence and increasing crime levels. In my own South-East region of the United Kingdom, the proposed forced settlement of 200 migrants near Chichester is viewed with fear, apprehension and mistrust, and that is totally understandable from a community of reportedly only 197 people. The importance of national and citizen consent should be paramount, not overridden or ignored by European Union forced numbers imposition, a dictatorial policy and an ill-considered ultimate control over asylum and refugee resettlement. Where detention or force has happened, it is because the level of pressure has become more than a Member State can bear or tolerate. The European Union needs to learn from its mistakes and also change direction completely. If you want newcomers to be welcomed, to smooth the process of acceptance and reintegration, to stop the community backlash and halt the instances of violence, then immediately stop behaving like a dictator, tell Mrs Merkel to rescind her siren call, and retract the freedom of movement principle.

Bulgaria has a great responsibility as an external border of the European Union to ensure the security of the Union. The country works closely with European agencies and international institutions and takes action in accordance with international and European law. In this context, I would like to point out 4 factors: first, we should use a uniform methodology when preparing monitoring reports assessing national reception systems for asylum seekers. This is definitely missing in the cited reports. Persons accusing them of committing violations should stand by their names. Second, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and the Bulgarian Helsinki Committee carry out daily monitoring of compliance with the principle of non-refoulement. From February 2015, it was decided to carry out unannounced inspections. So far, no signs of physical violence or degrading treatment have been identified. The presence of a Frontex employee during all proceedings with detained third-country nationals is a guarantee of compliance with the principle of non-refoulement. We should also show our respect for our own agencies, such as Frontex. Moreover, law enforcement officers receive special training on asylum issues. They conduct daily briefings, are subject to constant monitoring for compliance with the instructions. It is right to take into account the difficult conditions in which they work. Thirdly, the formal procedure in the event of an accusation of non-compliance with European law by a Member State requires that an official document be drawn up requesting an explanation from the relevant national authorities. Only in this way, having complete information from the parties concerned, can we be objective. Finally, colleagues, the key role of NAFTA is in the European Parliament.

We have experienced an uncanny hectic pace, we have seen barbed wire fences, we have seen camps - real and informal - we have seen the use of force. Much could have been avoided if one had followed the ideas that this House has long represented. In April we spoke of a holistic approach, we spoke of a differentiated approach, one would have to differentiate between migration, flight and displacement and asylum. Everything is lumped together, but we need different instruments. And that is also the problem: that the purpose of the asylum procedure is lost in the process of offering protection seekers, carrying out an individual examination, guaranteeing fair and speedy procedures. Internment is only an exception procedure and may only be necessary in certain circumstances. We have admission guidelines, we have talked about standards, we have talked about the fact that it cannot be a prison situation, as we have decided. We spoke about the special vulnerability of children and young people. We certainly haven't talked about the systematic use of force.

Do we really find it that shocking to briefly detain people who cross the border illegally to check their identity and origin? We are talking here about an uncontrolled mass influx of refugees. Colleagues, therefore, rather ask the question why our external borders are as leaky as a sieve and why Greece and Italy are not taking more action.

For the most part, the region on the border of Bulgaria with Turkey, which has been under strong migratory pressure for several years, is characterized by heavily rugged and difficult to access terrain. Bulgarian border police successfully work in harsh conditions and guarantee European security every day by breaking up networks of human traffickers, apprehending people accused of committing criminal or terrorist activities and rescuing migrants in distress when crossing the border. Despite the constant efforts of the Bulgarian border police, my country has once again been wrongfully accused by foreign NGOs of ill-treating asylum seekers. I would like to emphasize that a number of checks have been carried out on compliance with European legislation and on the work of the border police - none of which proves these allegations. The admission of illegal crossing of the state border through the unspecified places creates preconditions for entry into the territory of the Republic of Bulgaria and the European Union of accomplices and members of Islamic terrorist organizations. In view of this, Bulgaria is taking and will continue to take the strictest measures permitted by national and international law to ensure a high level of border security and to control the passage of the flow of illegal migrants and asylum seekers.

And that is why today is this debate in this Chamber. But all this would not have happened if the measures we had proposed earlier this year had been implemented. That is why the Member States somehow felt alone, they started to build borders and on the borders themselves, on the walls themselves, there was a huge tension. Dublin has not worked for a long time. The temporary refugee distribution mechanism has stalled. The hotspots have just started and the results are more than scarce. The criteria for their distribution in the Member States are not clear. As of today, a message has been added for a new methodology for 80,000 Syrian refugees, who must come annually from Turkey to European countries. At the same time, the majority of immigrants do not want to stay in the countries of the European Union's external border. They go to northern and western Europe. The lack of emergency measures and a clear outlook reinforces fears among both refugees and European citizens.

Crossing the border illegally, especially if there is no legal possibility of applying for asylum, is certainly not a worse offense than parking wrongfully. So it is not a criminal offense, and yet we arrest asylum seekers. Like Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, EU law stipulates that deprivation of liberty is only permitted as a last resort in an asylum procedure. Deprivation of liberty and thus imprisonment for the purpose of identification or to take fingerprints must therefore not be an automatic immediate measure.

We all somehow don't follow the rules, either on one side or the other. Only then can we rationally solve the problem of refugees. Today, we are talking here about the appalling situation of refugees and asylum seekers waiting at the European Union's external border or directly inside. Yes, their situation is appalling. But let's ask why this is so? Who are these people? And how do these people behave? Do they always follow all the rules? I could analyze the experience of refugee camps, from the borders, for a long time, but I don't think it's worth it. These things have been said many times here. From my own experience, I know that there are people everywhere who do not follow the rules, and the asylum application itself is not relevant to them. The legitimacy and length of their detention is therefore very debatable, and it is necessary to look at the whole matter from many angles.

Looking ahead means looking at a common future inside the European Union. The 20 years since 1995 have now proven beyond doubt that Dayton has delivered on its main objective of bringing peace and stability to Bosnia and Herzegovina and enabling post-conflict reconstruction. But many challenges remain. Much remains to be done to consolidate reconciliation. The Dayton Peace Agreement has also become fundamental to rebuilding peace and advancing reconciliation in the broader region. It has played an important part in the efforts to rebuild dialogue and cooperation in the Western Balkans. Some of the countries of the region, once enemies, have become signatories to the Agreement and over time have become friends and close partners investing in their joint future in the European Union. The Western Balkans region has moved a long way forward in the two decades since Dayton. Many countries of the region are candidates for EU membership, and Bosnia is a potential candidate. Bosnia has made considerable progress in its relations in the region – good neighbourly relations. The EU has been one of the largest donors to Bosnia, both during the war and in the post-war reconstruction period. Its presence largely focused on advancing political and economic reform and establishing a framework for the implementation of the EU’s Stabilisation and Association Process, following the Thessaloniki summit in June 2003 and the eventual integration of Bosnia into the EU. In addition, at the end of 2004, Bosnia also became the first country where instruments of both the CFSP and the ESDP were deployed on the ground. The EU continues today to safeguard the Dayton Agreement through EUFOR Althea. However, Bosnia is no longer a security consumer state, but a security provider. It has effectively contributed to UN and NATO missions and, since 15 September 2015, it can also effectively contribute to EU CSDP missions after signing its framework participation agreement in the EU crisis management operations. Progress may be uneven at times, but the strong desire of the majority of the country’s citizens will continue to guide political leadership in the right direction. The country’s citizens demand socio-economic and other reforms to improve their daily lives. They call for progress on the EU path to give themselves and their children the perspective of life in a free, democratic, stable and prosperous society, a society which protects minorities and fully respects human rights and freedoms. These are European values which the people of Bosnia and Herzegovina share. We in the European Union are fully committed to assisting Bosnia and Herzegovina in achieving this goal. In December 2014 the EU Council agreed to engage in a renewed approach to overcome the stalemate that then hindered Bosnia and Herzegovina’s EU path. Political institutions and leadership across the country have given their clear and unequivocal commitment to taking forward the reform required for progress on the EU path. Much has been achieved in 2015 on the basis of this commitment. The Stabilisation and Association Agreement entered into force on 1 June 2015. Subsequently, Bosnia and Herzegovina’s various government levels agreed the scope and depth of reforms to be undertaken. In this respect, the first ever EU-Bosnia Stabilisation and Association Council took place last week with positive results, as indicated in the joint communiqué published on the day. The initial focus has been on the socio-economic area, but the reform process already covers a much broader agenda. We have worked closely with international partners – in particular with the US and international financial institutions – to help make these reforms happen. We will continue these joint efforts to empower the authorities in Bosnia to take forward the transformation process effectively. This will not be easy, but it is certainly possible, and its success is fully in the hands of Bosnia and Herzegovina. At this point, Bosnia and Herzegovina is considering a possible application for EU membership. This is an achievement in itself and would have been difficult to think of only a year ago. But to make an application credible, Bosnia will need to continue to prove its credibility by delivering on commitments made. Over the last 12 months, together with the Bosnian authorities, represented today by the Chair and the members of Bosnia’s Presidency, we have engaged effectively. In this process the EU has responded with concrete deliverables to positive, constructive and concrete efforts undertaken by Bosnia. It is now up to Bosnia to give us good reasons to take a further step. In Dayton the future of Bosnia and Herzegovina was shaped by the country’s leaders, together with the neighbours and the international community. 20 years after Dayton the responsibility falls on Bosnia and Herzegovina and, following the steady steps of the past year, it is important not to jeopardise all that has been achieved so far. We truly hope that we will soon be able to open a new chapter in the history of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The EU is committed to doing all that is necessary on our side as soon as Bosnia makes a credible step towards us. Thank you for your attention.

A future which, in our opinion, is without a shadow of a doubt in Europe. It is therefore an opportunity to encourage, twenty years after Dayton, the authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina to continue on the path of reforms in order to be able to submit a credible membership application.

Then, constitutional reforms will have to be carried out which will transform Bosnia and Herzegovina into a democratic and functional state. I would also like to mention a point of great concern and likely to stand in the way of this European future for Bosnia and Herzegovina. This is the referendum on the judiciary in the Serbian Republic of Bosnia. This poses a serious threat to the cohesion, sovereignty and integrity of the country.

The central institutions of a state are very weak and often contested, which further complicates the functioning of the central institutions of that state. The return of refugees in Bosnia and Herzegovina is marginal. Thus, according to church data, only 4% of the pre-war number of Croats live on the territory of the Republika Srpska. The number of Bosniaks in the territory of the Republika Srpska is a bit more favorable, but far from being satisfactory. A similar situation, not as difficult as in the Republika Srpska, is with the return of refugees to the entire territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I welcome the new approach of the European Union that should enable Bosnia and Herzegovina to become a member of that elite society. I also welcome the reform plan adopted in Bosnia and Herzegovina with the help of the European Union, and I look forward to the implementation, proper implementation and enforcement of these reforms.

At that time, of course, the agreement was urgently needed to ensure peace in Bosnia and Herzegovina and to stop the bloodshed in the country. Unfortunately, the agreement failed to create, to form a functional, well-functioning state, as was also conceived, and these were also the wishes of many. That is why, unfortunately, Bosnia and Herzegovina today still faces a difficult economic situation, a high unemployment rate, a brain drain, as well as corruption, discrimination and I could go on and on. And I think that after twenty years, it is time to look at the constitution and look at these founding acts, which in a way make the normal functioning of the state impossible. That is why the Group of the Greens proposed that we have a debate on this topic at the meeting and, above all, use it as a positive moment to shape the post-Dayton future of the country. Already in 2005, the Venice Commission prepared a comprehensive, detailed and very good proposal on how the existing Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be reformed in such a way that it will work in the true sense of the word. Therefore, it is not necessary to re-invent complete reforms, but to use already existing documents and proposals, which are excellent and certainly welcome. The state, as it is composed, of course divided into entities, cantons, districts, prevents efficient and normal functioning. Also, among other things, because of various institutes, such as the veto, which is sometimes used more often than the search for compromises. Dayton, of course, needs to change, it needs to be considered. However, I am convinced that, of course, there are documents, that there is a will that can perform these tasks or these changes. The Venice Commission has been very clear in its writings, and one of these is that, of course, the entities should in some way transfer part of their sovereignty to a state that could be more effective in this way.

Initially, Bosnia made terrific progress rebuilding and reforming rapidly after a brutal four-year war. It was only in the last decade that we have seen the deterioration of progress. This is because some Bosnian politicians exploit Dayton, promoting old ethnic divisions and undermining efforts to move the country forward. Bosnia has been held back while neighbouring states have moved ahead towards the EU and NATO. Constitutional change will eventually be needed for the country to transform it into a fully functional state. However, let us not use Dayton as an excuse to say that no progress can be achieved under it. Let us not use it as an excuse to stall reform and keep Bosnia from moving closer to EU membership. As an S&amp;D rapporteur for Bosnia, I will, together with colleagues in the Group, do my utmost to help Bosnia apply and then negotiate EU membership. For me, addressing the socio-economic problem is key. This has also been repeatedly promised by all Bosnian politicians, and we need to hold them to their word. Also, I would like to see more civil society, minorities and youth engaging to be part of an open dialogue. Out duty is to promote education and remembrance. It is essential to break down the ethnic barriers so that the next generation does not inherit the prejudices of this one. That is what building democracy is all about. Meanwhile we must be firm against those that attempt to undermine Bosnia’s judicial institutions and promote secession. The changes moving Bosnia forward will have to be driven from within.

Many even today invoke such an upgrade unaware of the fact that it has already happened on several occasions. Namely, with more than 300 directives that have never been ratified by any body in the state of Bosnia and Herzegovina, various high representatives have significantly changed what was signed in Dayton without the possibility of appeal from citizens and their legitimate representatives. Therefore, if we already want to revise or significantly upgrade the Dayton Peace Agreement, we must first of all revise the role of the High Representative, who, without any democratic legitimacy, passes directives that have greater force than the original agreement. I hope that in the joint resolution we will adopt my formulation by which I demand that any future reorganization of Bosnia and Herzegovina guarantees true equality to all three constituent peoples.

And it is a compromise between thinking that Dayton is still a good enough framework for Bosnia and Herzegovina and attitudes that see it as an increasingly narrow framework for the country's development. The signing of the Dayton Peace Agreement is a victory of diplomacy over war, but it was a very belated and costly victory. One hundred thousand killed, two million displaced persons and enormous material destruction are direct consequences of the war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and the war against Bosnia and Herzegovina. The failure of the international community to recognize the causes, motives and protagonists of the war in time significantly affected the character and course of the conflict and the circumstances of concluding the peace agreement. The consequences of what was done, but also what was missed, are still felt today. However, the real political challenges for Bosnia and Herzegovina at the moment are in the country itself. Unlike twenty years ago, there is clear support from her neighborhood today. The prospect of membership, as we well know in Croatia, implies a serious job of change and adjustment to European standards. Especially in a multinational, extremely complex state union where there is always a need to talk about upgrading the system, especially if there are obvious shortcomings. Bosnia and Herzegovina is not, and cannot be, an exception. Analyzes show that they have weakened almost all the institutions of the international community created to implement the peace agreement and oversee the country's key processes of reconstruction and functioning.

It has been forbidden that the Federal Criminal Police Office, to put it this way, of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the Republika Srpska, can no longer be active and it has been declared an unconstitutional institution of the Public Prosecutor of the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is active in the field of Republika Srpska is illegal.

It was also said here that the situation today is not very pleasing, that there is a huge level of unemployment, especially of young people, an overall rather rising rate of poverty, the region is not prospering and there is also a lot of corruption. The European Union can hardly actively resolve these issues on behalf of the citizens of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bosnia has sadly not progressed to the level it should have 20 years later. Rather than paving the way from a war-torn country to a unified and functional state, the constitution agreed at Dayton laid out a post-war political system of power-sharing that reflects the ethnic divisions that had fuelled the war.

I would like to begin by thanking all the shadow rapporteurs who have been very helpful in drafting this report. It has been several years since Parliament presented its latest arms export report, and my ambition now is for the annual review to resume. Not least because we live in a completely new security policy environment with major changes in our world. We have both wars and conflicts in our immediate area and armed violence at home linked to them. In this perspective, Parliament has an increasingly important role to play in examining how well Member States are complying with the common acquis on arms exports. Therefore, the report is based on three pillars: the changed security situation, the application of the common acquis and openness and transparency. The other day, less than a month after the horrific attacks in Paris, Amnesty International released a report, this report. The report describes how Daesh got his weapons. These include weapons that were exported to Iraq during the war against Iran and later to the Iraqi army and which then became too easy a prey for Daesh when they captured large parts of all Iraqi defense weapons. The report mentions a number of European weapons types from e.g. Germany, Belgium, the Czech Republic and Croatia. My home country Sweden is not mentioned, but considering that Swedish munitions have also been exported to Iraq, both via licensed products and indirectly via the US, I think it is too likely that they have appeared or may appear in Daesh's ruthless war against all dissidents . The question we have to ask ourselves is why does Daesh have so many European weapons and if the Member States have not lived up to the common position? Today we have a situation where our own once legally sold weapons end up completely out of our control, and we do not know who has them, what they are to be used for or if they risk being turned against ourselves. For many years in peace, virtually all arms-exporting countries sold munitions to the dictators of the Middle East and North Africa without any major concerns, either over the lack of respect for human rights or the situation in the country as such. The dictators were seen as stable, and they became an important market for European armaments. The area is now on fire, while many individual Member States have long-term contracts and promises of follow-up deliveries for many years to come. We can therefore state that the risk assessments have not worked, nor has the end-user control, but also that the Member States have stretched the regulations to the limit in order to be able to sell. Today, Raif Badawi has been awarded the Sakharov Prize, and in this House we have heard about the horrific punishments Badawi and many other Saudis are subjected to simply for expressing an opinion, but despite the total lack of respect for human rights, Saudi Arabia is still the country to receive buy most European munitions even though the country is obviously not only using them for its own defense but also now in a war of aggression in neighboring Yemen, where civilians are hard hit. Our role as parliamentarians is to ensure that the Member States live up to the common position. Weapons are not just any commodity. Weapons that were exported ten, twenty, thirty years ago are as dangerous today as when they were sold. Our role is also to suggest improvements. Today we propose i.a. a stricter risk assessment with a focus on the situation in the recipient country, a better follow-up with inspections of end users and not least a greater openness and democratic scrutiny of arms exports.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2064, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Nicolas SCHMIT", "mepid": "197428", "text": "President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, honourable Members, on behalf of the High Representative, Ms Mogherini, we very much welcome the preparation and discussion of the report prepared by the honourable Ms Valero. This is a testimony to parliamentary scrutiny over arms exports, which is a sound follow-up to transparency applied at EU level on arms export issues. Interaction channels with Parliament, and with NGOs and civil society, on arms export issues have been opened and have developed over the years. This is an invaluable achievement, and it illustrates that transparency and dialogue can fruitfully take place without prejudice to the respective responsibilities of national and EU stakeholders. At a time when we advocate further transparency worldwide, notably via the arms trade treaty, we believe it is important to flag that transparency does not run counter to national and regional security. The EU framework governing arms exports mainly revolves around the EU common position on arms exports adopted in 2008. This framework is unique. It is based on national responsibility of EU Member States, on licensing decisions, together with well-developed information sharing on licence denials and risk assessment. The risk assessment criteria laid down by the EU common position are comprehensive and far-reaching, notably in terms of respect for human rights and international humanitarian law, risk of diversion and impact on internal and regional stability. The daily application by national licensing officers is supported by common EU guidelines that have just been revised in 2015, notably in order to align them with the arms trade treaty. Against this background of national responsibility exercised within common risk—assessment criteria, the overarching objective of the EU common position is to promote convergence of national arms export policies. In support of this objective, the Council and the European External Action Service provide an information sharing platform which is the dedicated Council working group on arms exports, and an IT platform enabling to exchange details on license denials. Like the EU guidelines, these information sharing components have been recently overhauled as a result of the review of the EU common position achieved in 2015. This should further contribute to convergence of arms export policies as they are now being put into practice.  Let me now briefly widen the picture outside the EU. Firstly, in our close neighbourhood, a number of third countries – mainly in the eastern neighbourhood – have aligned with the criteria of the EU common position. To assist them in their daily operational implementation, the EU has had an outreach programme funding technical cooperation in place since 2009. The new phase covering 2016-2017 has just been adopted by the Council. Secondly, and moving to an even larger picture, I have to refer to the Arms Trade Treaty. It sets unique and widely accepted standards to achieve greater responsibility and transparency in the arms trade. The ATT entered into force in December 2014, and so far 130 states have signed it and 78 have ratified it, including 26 EU Member States. We urge the two remaining countries to ratify it as quickly as possible. Of note, however, is that some of the largest arms exporters and importers, such as Russia, China, India and Pakistan, have not signed or ratified it. Here again the EU does a lot to support the effective implementation and universalisation of the ATT. Today the dedicated EU assistance programme, with its EUR 6.4 million budget, is active in 10 countries in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and Asia. In addition to this tangible action on the ground, all diplomatic opportunities are used to encourage countries that have taken no steps towards the treaty to join it, possibly enabling them to benefit from the EU assistance programme where needed and requested. The arms trade is getting more and more globalised. It is our duty to lead by example when it comes to arms exports from the EU. It is equally our duty to encourage and support other arms manufacturers and traders to apply the ATT standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2065, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President! It is good that the European Union has such a common position that the Council has agreed on it. We are the only large region in the world that has something like this.

I also support what you have said with regard to the arms trade treaty and I endorse the request that the two remaining Member States, which are still missing, ratify this treaty. We have a changed security situation, as the rapporteur has also pointed out. The need to pursue more common foreign, security and defense policy will also mean that our export behavior will converge, i.e. there will be convergence with regard to where we export weapons, because of course the assessment of the security situation and the risks have to get closer and closer if we also pursue common politics there. For example, if the security situation changes, my country Germany is supplying weapons to a region for the first time - to the Peshmerga in northern Iraq - in order to make a contribution to the fact that they can defend themselves there, but also a threatened population group like the Yazidis, for example. I think we have to go into that too, and I hope that, based on this common position, we will continue to deal responsibly with our exports in the future.

In other words, all the issues have been dealt with with great success and, furthermore, not only that, but also with concrete proposals and quite rigor, or sufficient rigor to be taken into account. I believe that this exercise is going to be really positive and, therefore, I also encourage others to support this report, with the necessary caveats, but in any case, the report itself is very positive. Allow me also to state that there are two developments in this report that seem fundamental to me and they are the following: first, the proposal to create the Arms Export Control Authority, under the auspices of the High Representative, ―which can precisely prevent the weak points in the acceptance and implementation of the Common Position that we are seeing in the Member States, as there are no coercive or sanctioning elements for non-compliance with the different clauses of the Common Position - and, secondly, the configuration in the proposal of lists of natural and legal persons not only who have been convicted, but also who have been involved - and we know it from the intelligence services - in situations of illicit export or illicit manipulation of weapons. I think they are important elements that can also help us. In addition, we have also taken into account that there are weapons that pass through Europe, but for non-military skills or activities, but hunting and sports activities, and that many times they have to do with popular collections - as is the case in my country. - and, therefore, I believe that hunters in the mountains of my land do not have to have concerns or problems. But, on the other hand, your report also clearly shows the criticisms that we must continue to take into account for future reports and for the Commission's future report. And it is that, this time, it was a very late report, because the information was not there. Very little transparency in this information. I see that Mr. Gahler has left because he does not accept that, in some cases, his country is named precisely because, being one of the large exporters, he does not provide enough information.

It mixes without any connection the legal and illegal export and trade in weapons. The control mechanism itself is a good wish and nothing more. I call this report largely hypocritical because the big Member States have not stopped and do not stop producing and selling weapons to third countries, including in high-risk war zones. On the other hand, countries like my homeland Bulgaria were pressed, our military-defense and industrial complex was destroyed.

Of course, it is possible to say that in this sense this report comes too late. The foreign policy of the European Union and its trade policy should serve the achievement of its goals, but also the affirmation of those democratic values ​​on which the European Union is based. If this is the case, and it is, then this is especially the purpose of the arms export policy of the European Union member states. But even in this area, as in the field of arms standardization, joint procurement and production of weapons and research in the field of armaments, the European Union unfortunately does not have a clear unified and common policy. Europe must set high standards for the sale of arms so that, in the same way as those other countries, large arms exporters can advocate compliance with those high standards and so that these arms do not fall into the wrong hands.

We have the Common Position governing the control of exports of military equipment and the Common Position on the export of conventional arms, in addition to the Code of Conduct on arms exports. The principles are clear: respect for the country's human rights at the final destination; the internal situation regarding tensions or armed conflicts; the maintenance of peace, security, stability in the regions; the behavior of the buyer regarding terrorism, respecting international law; and no re-export. But let's get to reality. In the annual report on arms exports, we see that we are the third largest exporter in the world: more than 24 billion euros. France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Spain stand out. And what is the second destination of the sale of our weapons? Middle East: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, United Arab Emirates, countries that do not meet the requirements of the Positions or the eight criteria. It is clear that we are using weapons as a foreign policy, supporting political and geostrategic interests of Israel or the Gulf countries. The modification in May 2013 of the embargo on Syria to sell arms to a supposed opposition is the last straw. Supposed opposition that has become Daesh, and in a video of December 14 we saw that arsenal of weapons, the majority coming from the European Union.

Let me start with an overall assessment, which unfortunately is not positive, and here the agreement is quite common. I would like to emphasize that the report for the period 2013-2014, which is the source of this report, is a report that mainly describes the mechanisms and processes that take place at the interface between the legal and the alleged legal distributor. I am also very interested in everything related to the target countries to which the weapons are to be sent, because this means that we are currently dealing with an extremely key element, i.e. the credibility of this effect of transporting weapons from Europe to the outside. I would like to emphasize, however, that such a general belief, which very often prevails, that tightening the criteria here in Europe, both in terms of licensing as regards the release for distribution, as regards controlling the country of destination of transport, will result in an increase in safety, however, is in fact certain naivety. Today Europe itself has a gigantic problem with the ease of access to conventional weapons, which can be bought online and can be put together. And, of course, we are dealing with access to this weapon not from the licensed or those who apply for a license, but very often from complete amateurs who deal with this distribution of weapons. Therefore, those citizens who are right-minded respect the law and do not have access to this weapon. Everyone else has easy access to weapons and it's worth talking about. The gigantic business related to the trade of conventional weapons must finally also meet the security business, because security in Europe, the security of an individual citizen, is also an economic value and we must remember this.

I thank the rapporteur for this annual report and welcome the key call for an independent European arms control authority under the auspices of the High Representative of the European Union. I also regret - as described in the report - that only 21 Member States with data made a full contribution to the 16th annual report. Unfortunately, Germany is not there either. In my opinion, the urgently needed Europeanization of security and defense policy and the pooling and sharing of armaments products that are to be strived for must go hand in hand with the creation of common restrictive standards in export policy. In doing so, we must ensure that existing national export guidelines are not relaxed. It cannot be that economic interests or the financial basis for arms research serve as a drive to export as many weapons as possible to countries outside the EU. That is why we should deal with the question of public co-financing of armaments in the pooling and sharing debate. Exporting weapons to war and crisis areas or states in which human rights are not guaranteed or EU development projects are undone is contrary to a coherent foreign and trade policy. Only if it is certain that European weapons do not fall into the wrong hands can we take responsibility for co-financing defense research projects from EU funds. I share the report's concern that EU export controls can be circumvented with license manufacturing in third countries or with branches of EU companies. I therefore support the approach of the German federal government that the transfer of licensed products of small arms to third countries will be banned in the future. I also support the report's aim of including the situation in the next annual report in a European comparison.

I am sure this report is needed, especially in the new security situation. We are treading in an important and sensitive area. Therefore, we have to be balanced and realistic.

I appreciate that we were able to balance the report by pointing out that arms are needed for self—defence, as defined by Article 51 of the UN Charter. It is important to make sure that nations facing armed aggression, like the Ukrainians or the Kurdish Peshmerga, should be able to have defensive arms. It is also positive that the role of the EU defence industry has been highlighted. We need the industry in question for our security, but also for the development of modern technological bases in Europe.  The EPP stands strongly behind the common position. The latter needs, first of all, efficient implementation, not necessarily an extension of its powers. More transparency and information sharing, for example about persons whose licences for exporting arms have been denied, is important. Problems for the EPP emerge mainly from attempts to cross into the subsidiarity domain, because national defence remains in the competence of the Member States.

The beneficial effects of the eight criteria contained in the common position of the Member States are to be found in France's welcome decision to return to the contract for the export of mistral vessels to Russia and to stop deliveries.

The legally binding framework demonstrates the determination, or at least a first step towards determination, of EU Member States to prevent the export of military technology and equipment that might be used for undesirable purposes such as internal repression or international aggression, as happened recently in Ukraine, or contribute to regional instability.

A light breeze of pacifism hovered over the authors' original text. Pacifism is well and honestly meant, pacifism, which, however, is still not suitable for the pursuit of peace.

It is based, for example, on the real situation in Ukraine, to which the article of the United Nations Charter on the Right to Self-Defense fully applies. It also reflects the real policy of the European Union. This summer, the European Union essentially lifted the arms embargo on Ukraine and opened the way for Ukraine to self-defense.

The Union is responsible for more than 1/4 of the arms exports worldwide and for more than 1/3 of the world arms trade to third countries and continues with an extraordinarily opaque and corrupt defense sector, due to the inaction or design of governments Member States. There is an urgent need to create an independent supervisory authority and a standardized reporting and reporting mechanism for all Member States with sanctions for violations of the common position. It is essential that governments provide detailed accounts of exports, including quantities, values ​​and destinations. It is the security of our citizens, of our neighborhood and globally, that is at stake, as demonstrated by the recent terrorist attacks in Paris, carried out with weapons and explosives produced and easily acquired here in Europe. It is essential that the Council and the Commission ensure transparency in the defense sector, not tolerating allegedly national security explanations, so often invoked to protect private interests that serve neither our security nor our industry. In addition to curbing exports to unstable regions and countries, stoking conflicts, Member States may not transfer weapons or military or dual-use equipment to countries that can use them in the repression of civilians or can divert them and traffic them for purposes illegal acts, namely by reaching terrorist groups. This is the case of Saudi Arabia, which has already been mentioned here several times today. The exception to this rule exists within the framework of the Common Security and Defense Policy, under the guidance of the High Representative and resulting from coordination between Member States in military support and assistance, such as that which should be provided to the Peshmerga in Iraq and Syria, if there was a European articulation to fight Daexe, which unfortunately has not been there. The European defense industry must also correctly apply the 2009 defense markets directives if it wants to survive and be competitive worldwide, but as the Valero report says, it must not forget that it must serve Europe's security, guarantee its strategic autonomy in military equipment and technology, including to ensure cybersecurity, the security of critical infrastructure and security in space.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 2083, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Lara COMI", "mepid": "96775", "text": "- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the global context of internal security in the European Union has changed drastically in recent years, precisely because it is also aggravated by the fact that the Member States are the main exporters of arms worldwide. We are talking about over 36 billion exports in 2013. Weapons that can hardly be traced back to legal trade flows, this is the real problem, which are aimed at the security of the European Union, but not actually intended to fuel what can be a trade legal with due if and due but. All these arms and trade have fueled and are fueling terrorism and armed conflict. Conversely, rampant corruption within third countries has repercussions on the security of our citizens, with smuggling and trafficking of arms entering Europe quietly due to an almost absence of checks at points of entry. It is absurd that we close the borders, we say no to Schengen, but at the same time we manage to have an illegal quantity of weapons within our European territory with a certain degree of tranquility. So I am certainly in favor, as my colleague also said previously, of more checks, of certainly having greater sharing of information within the various European structures. Furthermore, I am also of the opinion that a separation must be made between military and civilian weapons, as technologies such as remote piloting systems, applied robotics and surveillance technologies could not only be harmful to human rights, but they could also pose a significant threat to Europe's strategic interests and to our digital infrastructures. I take the liberty of concluding by saying that ISIS uses, as we have seen, European passports and weapons in various attacks and I believe that we should carry out a trade blockade with the countries that buy and sell weapons to ISIS.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 2084, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Sergio Gaetano COFFERATI", "mepid": "96915", "text": "- Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the sale of arms is always a difficult issue to tackle, very delicate, even more so in these years in which Europe has seen the resurgence of wars and has seen the phenomenon of terrorism return with such virulence . I believe that we need to look very carefully at two phenomena that have occurred in recent times. The first is that which concerns the constant increase in the turnover of companies that produce weapons, not only those that are exported, but also those that are supplied in Europe. The second is the systematic, blatant violation of the eight criteria of the 2008 common position. They are violations for all to see. For this reason, a regulation capable not only of establishing authorities, but of restricting the space for those who produce and sell weapons and above all of dictating rules to the states that are affected by this process, is welcome. For this reason, I would like to highlight four aspects among those that have already been addressed. The first is that which concerns transparency: it is unacceptable that large European countries do not provide data on the sale of arms, unacceptable, also because behind there is the hypocrisy of those who say they want to fight war and terrorism and then do not the bare minimum to be able to govern this process. The second is that which concerns brokerage: brokerage has grown, it must be hit and disintegrated, obviously in political terms. Third thing, which is very important, is that along with the sale of weapons there is the sale of technologies, which are equally dangerous. Finally, the sanctions.

The report on arms exports rightly focuses on the worrying global security situation. The civil wars in Syria, Yemen and Libya and the armed conflict between government troops and separatists in eastern Ukraine urge the responsible use of weapons. Their uncontrolled spread is a serious threat to peace, security, human rights and sustainable development. Arms deliveries to conflicting states increase the likelihood of an escalation of violence. The regulation of the international arms trade is therefore an absolute necessity, since without controls, terrorists and repressive regimes can also be strengthened in neighboring EU countries. In 2008 the EU created a catalog of rules. Since then, the export of weapons in crisis regions has been strictly regulated. The same applies to the transfer of sensitive knowledge and armaments technology to third countries. However, the right to self-defense must be taken into account. The Peshmerga in northern Iraq and the Ukrainian troops were able to protect themselves against the attackers thanks to European weapons. Demands for significantly stronger export criteria and more extensive sanctions are very ambitious, as the EU member states already provide detailed data in the arms control reports.

A common policy on arms exports to the European Union with clear rules is essential for us at the moment. As an important instrument for combating terrorism and combating local conflicts that threaten European interests. However, we need not only a framework for controlling arms exports from individual Member States, but also a coherent arms embargo policy and, above all, more effective cooperation with our two agencies, Europol and Eurojust. But also, in the first place, we must start fighting against ourselves against the illegal arms trade in the European Union. In my opinion, the first step in this fight is to reduce the illegal possession of weapons. I would like to point out another fact that has not yet been mentioned here. There are a huge number of weapons circulating and trafficked among the citizens of the European Union, for example in the Balkan countries, after the wars. I see a solution in the so-called weapons amnesty, which would allow these holders of illegal weapons to return them without penalty. This amnesty was a great success in the Czech Republic.

Common Position 2008/944 / CFSP offers a comprehensive legal framework on arms exports, but more efforts are needed by Member States to apply all eight criteria set out in the document. Moreover, I would also like to highlight that today there is a lack of common control procedures in specific technical areas, such as the conversion of military weapons into civilians, the treatment of deactivated weapons and weapons intended for stage use, also in relation to their possible trade. On these aspects my country, Italy, has adopted strict technical and administrative prescriptions in order to avoid illegal practices in the treatment of weapons.

I still hope that tomorrow, when we vote, we can have sufficiently broad support for the report in this House, and that we can move forward so that we also have a new annual report next year, so that this will be the annual review that Parliament makes the legal sale of arms, and the one for which we have common rules.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2092, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI", "mepid": "28314", "text": "The debate is closed.

European-Vietnamese relations have grown rapidly. It is therefore time to develop the regulatory framework for our relationship. It will now consist of a Framework Agreement between the European Union and Vietnam. It is important for us to remember that Vietnam is part of the Pacific Partnership, a new, newly established trading bloc that accounts for 36% of the world's gross domestic product and could have a very far-reaching impact on world trade. It is also strategically important for the European Union to resolve tensions with the countries of the South China Sea basin in order to maintain peace and stability there and to ensure the stability of major maritime transport routes. This is very important for European trade. That is why Vietnam has a strategic role to play as an important partner for the European Union in South-East Asia and ASEAN. I firmly believe that the EU-Vietnam Comprehensive Partnership and Cooperation Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement must also help to strengthen prosperity and human rights in Vietnam.

In Parliament, we only discussed the framework agreement on comprehensive partnership and cooperation between the EU and Vietnam, and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs we came to the recommendation that the agreement should be approved. In order for this framework agreement to come into force, we call on the Member States France, Ireland, Greece and Italy to ratify this agreement as soon as possible. We agreed across political groups that Vietnam-EU relations are on the right track and should intensify in the areas of trade and development, anti-corruption, human rights protection, environment and climate change, science and technology, education and culture, peace and security. Vietnam has transformed in recent years from one of the poorest countries in the world with the difficult legacy of two cruel wars to a middle-income country with rapid economic growth. The poverty rate fell from 58% in 1993 to 11.8% in 2011. In the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals, Vietnam has excelled in the areas of right to education, right to housing and right to food. In Vietnam's socio-economic development strategy for 2011 to 2020, structural reforms are at the center, including macroeconomic stability, social justice and ecological stability. The fight against corruption is also part of macroeconomic stability. The damage to the economy caused by corruption is estimated in an official Vietnamese report from 2012 at 1.7% to 3.3% of the gross domestic product. In Transparency International's corruption perception index, the country ranks 119th out of 175 countries. The Vietnamese government has taken countermeasures, but more consistent and far-reaching steps need to be taken. The EU-Vietnam human rights dialogue will take place this week in Hanoi. In the present framework agreement, too, we are calling for the government to take a significant turnaround in order to allow freedom of expression, even if it includes criticism of government action. There is censorship on the internet, social media and websites are often blocked. Almost all print and radio channels are state controlled. Vietnam is currently a member of the United Nations Human Rights Council and has undergone the general human rights review. It would go too far here to list all human rights violations. I just want to underline that Vietnam has promised to implement improvements in the right to freedom of expression and also to allow an independent civil society. Last week in Strasbourg we discussed the now ratified EU-Vietnam free trade agreement with Commissioner Malmström. There will be an institutional link between the free trade agreement and the partnership and cooperation agreement. This ensures that principles of human rights and the rule of law are an essential part of the relationship between the EU and Vietnam - also with regard to trade between the two parties. The Commission still needs to complete the human rights impact assessment requested by the EU Ombudsman. In 2014 there were also conflicts between Chinese and Vietnamese fishermen in the area of ​​foreign and security policy in the South China Sea. We very much welcome the fact that the heads of state of both states have agreed to settle the maritime dispute by peaceful means. We also welcome the fact that in spring 2015 Vietnam declared its official support for the application by the Philippine government to appeal to the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague on the Chinese territorial claims in the South China Sea. All in all, we have a very extensive resolution here with specific areas of work for the joint EU-Vietnam cooperation.Once again, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for a very constructive and good cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 2098, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Andrus ANSIP", "mepid": "124696", "text": "Vice-President of the Commission. – Madam President, I am pleased to speak here in Parliament today before the vote on concluding the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and Vietnam, as well as on the Protocol for Croatia’s accession to the Agreement. This Agreement will provide a modern and comprehensive framework for the EU-Vietnam relationship, which has deepened and broadened over the past few years. Twenty-five years ago the then European Community and Vietnam established diplomatic relations. In these 25 years, our ties have grown from their humanitarian origins to a multifaceted partnership with trade and development at its core. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, together with the Free Trade Agreement concluded two weeks ago, will allow us to go even further. Today’s debate is an opportunity to acknowledge Vietnam’s role as a close partner for the European Union in South—East Asia and for our relations with ASEAN in particular. As ASEAN’s coordinator for relations with the European Union, Vietnam has provided valuable support in bringing our two regions closer together. In South—East Asia, Vietnam is one of the fastest growing economies today. Social and economic progress in the last two decades has been impressive as millions have been lifted out of poverty. Its foundations were laid in the late 1980s through an ambitious economic reform programme. Today, the EU, in turn, is Vietnam’s second largest trade partner, the largest development donor and one of Vietnam’s largest foreign investors.  Vietnam is now entering a new phase of national development and aims to become an industrialised country by 2020. To do so it needs to move from a growth model based on low—cost labour to one based on innovation and productivity. This calls for major structural changes and continued investments in infrastructure and human capital.  The European Union wants a strong and prosperous Vietnam, a Vietnam that respects the rule of law and human rights. Our persistent message to our Vietnamese counterparts is that good governance, human rights and the rule of law are the driving force for development, that a free media and a free internet provide huge benefits for Vietnam to succeed in the new knowledge-based economy and to meet the myriad of challenges that come with a modernising society, and that greater openness and opportunities for people to participate and actively engage with the institutions are needed to support Vietnam’s vision of becoming an inclusive and modern society. It is therefore in Vietnam’s best interests to honour its international commitments regarding human rights. Let me be clear. The European Union and Vietnam enjoy a close and ever—expanding partnership but, as in any relationship, there are areas where we have differences. These are, first and foremost, in the critical area of human rights and Mrs Lochbihler’s report rightly places much emphasis on this. In this respect we noted with concern the arrest today, just one day after the EU-Vietnam human rights dialogue, of Mr Nguyen Van Dai, a lawyer and human rights activist. We have expressed this clearly to our Vietnamese partners. The Partnership and Cooperation Agreement provides us with a much better basis to address issues such as the rule of law and human rights than the Framework Cooperation Agreement of 1996. Respect for human rights and democratic principles constitutes an essential element of the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, with a much broader and more comprehensive set of commitments when compared with the previous instrument. The rule of law features among the fundamental principles covered by Article 1 of the Agreement. Let me assure you that these principles will guide us in our relations. The enhanced human rights dialogue that we agreed to establish in 2012 is the most visible evidence of our commitment here. The latest session was held just yesterday in Hanoi.  I trust that with the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, and thanks to the strong ties between the European Parliament and the National Assembly of Vietnam, we stand a better chance to support Vietnam’s transition towards a more open society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 2099, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Lochbihler and the other shadow rapporteurs for their good collaboration on this resolution.

Parliament's approval is an important step for the ratification of the agreement which we must of course support. Vietnam is now an essential partner of the Union. A closer relationship with this country will not only allow the European Union to have privileged access to a dynamic market of more than 90 million inhabitants, but also to consolidate its strategic position in Asia, while pursuing its objectives. peace, rule of law and democracy. I would also like to highlight the conclusion of the negotiations on the free trade agreement with Vietnam. We must not forget, however, that this country still has many challenges to meet, particularly in terms of respect for human rights. The recommendations contained in the resolution will, I hope, help Vietnam to support the necessary reforms, such as respect for minority rights, the fight against corruption or the reform of the judicial system. Throughout the work on this resolution, I tried to find compromises with my colleagues in order to obtain a balanced text, which could be a tool to support the implementation of the partnership agreement.

EU—Vietnam relations are of vital importance in the current geopolitical context, especially with Asia leapfrogging to global prominence, the US and China each spearheading mega trade deals in the region, and tensions in the South China Sea threatening stability in that region. So the EU needs to get actively involved in all of these developments to ensure we keep peace in the region. That is why I wholeheartedly support this partnership and cooperation agreement. I believe it provides a basis for strengthening relations in fields that are of major importance from both a global perspective and our own bilateral perspective. I also welcome the agreement on free trade. I believe this gives Vietnam the opportunity to invest the benefits of trade for all groups within its society, reform its governance system, improve its human rights and join the global fight against climate change. I welcome the fact that my political group was able to secure the inclusion of important language on the need to step up efforts in all these fields, and particularly on human trafficking. It is a key migration policy, and the fight against trafficking and organised crime needs to be strengthened. However, this is not just something that Vietnam has to deal with. It is also the EU’s responsibility to look at why – and how – we can stop a large number of Vietnamese children from being exploited across different parts of the EU. A specialised working group on cooperation in this field should be set up to address this. The Commission has to be mindful that the success of any deal hinges on its implementation. Firstly, this means keeping in mind that Vietnam is still a developing country and we cannot ask it to do more than is realistically possible until we further step up capacity support. The European External Action Service also has to address shortcomings in relation to the information available to this House on international agreements to allow us fully to carry out our monitoring role and help us make this agreement a basis for a successful strategic relationship in the wider region too. I hope that we will be using this to build on progress achieved, thanks to coordination with Vietnam, to kick-start the re-launch of region-to-region FTA negotiations.

Although I appreciate the concerns raised by some of my colleagues – property rights, child labour and access to education are obvious examples that come to mind – we should ensure that a carefully calibrated political message is sent to Vietnam. Comprehensive reforms should be encouraged, but threatening language could be counterproductive.

I just wanted to comment on some of the last speakers who are here now. It goes without saying that the report lists that we demand that there should be free trade unions, and the persecution of various religious groups, including the Christian minority, is also explicitly mentioned in the report. In my opinion, the entire terminology and the presentation of human rights violations are not threatening - that is how I understood Mr Bashir - but actually reflect the vocabulary and discourse that the Vietnamese government itself cultivates, for example within the United Nations. The colleague who said that it might be a threat to medium-sized companies in Vietnam should be pointed out to the fact that in this agreement we are calling for a human rights assessment of the consequences of this free trade agreement, which is currently intended to assess whether large European companies entering the Vietnamese market come, displace small SMEs. And now to Article 33, which has been mentioned several times and which is particularly criticized not only by the ECR Group, but also by others. We consulted informally this afternoon and I think most of the political groups will be voting against this article which deals with corruption and visa waiver. But maybe I have to briefly express my astonishment that I received an email this afternoon from Mr. Zahradil, the chairman of the Vietnamese Friendship Group, in which he actually indicated that he would not agree to this agreement. So that - I hope I have now understood it correctly - only relates to Article 33. Because the approval of this agreement is very essential and is also demanded by the Vietnamese government, because otherwise it cannot be implemented at all. Here I can again advocate that we get a large approval for the agreement as a whole, and of course you can disagree with individual articles.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 2117, "date": "2015-12-16.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "I close the debate.The vote will take place on Thursday 17 December 2015.
