In view of the refugee movements, we are facing a historic test, which we can certainly only overcome together. With solidarity internally and with solidarity to the outside world. That is why we are voting immediately on an emergency measure to relocate 120 000 asylum seekers from Italy, Greece and Hungary to other EU Member States. However, we can only overcome the ongoing humanitarian crisis if we also think about the external dimension of the problem. The situation in Syria, but also and especially in Syria's neighbouring countries, is deteriorating. Every day, therefore, more people make the perilous journey to Europe. We all know that the conflict in Syria is now entering its fifth year. There is no political solution in sight. Violence has continued to explode in recent months. People who get away with their lives still lose their livelihoods and their livelihoods and their homes. More than half of the people in this country live in extreme poverty, and also those four million registered Syrians who, thanks to the admirable generosity of their neighbours in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, have found refuge, live, or better survive, in difficult circumstances. This is quite simply because the host countries, especially Jordan and Lebanon, are reaching their limits, and also those aid workers who continue to assist the most needy in Syria and neighbouring countries in the most difficult circumstances are reaching their limits. The UNHCR is running out of money. Many of you have met Mr Guterres here this week. But, ladies and gentlemen, we cannot abandon our fellow Members, the aid workers and, above all, the UNHCR! The Madad Fund was established in December 2014 to provide basic services for refugees on the ground and to assist the host countries. Just two days ago in this House, Mrs Mogherini reminded us in this House that EUR 4 billion should flow from this fund. So far, however, ladies and gentlemen, only EUR 5 million has been contributed to the EUR 41 million from the EU budget from Germany and eur 3 million from Italy.  That is why, as President-in-Office of the Council, I have asked Prime Minister Bettel, as President-in-Office of the Council, in a letter relating to our resolution last week, to ensure that the outstanding funds are finally paid. (Applause) At the same time, I also call on the Commission to allocate all available funds from the EU budget to aid, particularly in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, where possible, and Turkey.  Ladies and gentlemen, if we do not manage to do that, we will have many more problems than we already have today. Our credibility also depends on whether the money we make available to these countries is actually paid. I would therefore like to thank you for your support. I will publish this letter. And I have asked Mr Bettel, in the event that there should be an extraordinary European Council next week, to ask the Heads of State or Government to pay these funds immediately.

I voted in favour of the Commission's proposal to relocate 120 000 asylum seekers from Italy and Greece (since Hungary has refused to benefit from the mechanism) because it is an urgent and necessary measure given the situation that the refugee crisis has produced in those countries and through the EU as a whole. It is a proposal that represents a significant increase from the 40,000 re-locations we voted on on 9 September. In addition, I voted in favour because I would like to send a strong message to the Council of Ministers for Justice and Home Office which will meet on 22 September to approve this second emergency mechanism at once.

The developments of recent weeks unmask the hypocrisy of the speech on an alleged EU humanitarian response to the refugee crisis. These developments leave the inhuman nature of that answer to the naked, which is the nature of the European Union itself. What has been sold to the peoples of Europe as an area of progress and development, peace, solidarity and respect for human rights, reveals to us, in the face of general horror, its true nature. Walls and barbed wire erected and dogs cast against those fleeing war and hunger; detention camps where everything is lacking, starting with the dignity denied to refugees. This Commission proposal falls short of what would be needed and contains aspects of which we disagree. However, it is imperative that at least the limited support provided for here can be used for refugees who will be relocated – from Italy, Greece and Hungary – in other Member States.

The situation at the borders of the eastern Mediterranean deteriorated dramatically in July and August 2015, when a figure of more than 137,000 illegal migrants entered Greece via Dodekanese and the northeastern Aegean Islands (especially Kos and Lesbos) was found. Equally, more than 42,000 illegal migrants arrived in Italy through the central Mediterranean, and 78,472 migrants entered Hungary across the Hungarian-Serbian border during the same period.
