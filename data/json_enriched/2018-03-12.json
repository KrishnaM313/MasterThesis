Just a few hours away from Strasbourg, Syrians are suffering, Syrians are hostages to stakes that surpass them. And far from bringing hope, recent developments in recent days keep away any prospect of embellishment. In just a few weeks, the offensive on Eastern Ghouta killed more than a thousand: children, women and vulnerable elderly people. Thousands of injured people are in absolute emergency situations. Finally, the spiral of violence leads to fear the worst: the humanitarian situation within the encircled enclave is likely to worsen rapidly. The news coming from there is terrible. All parties must assume their responsibilities, including, I repeat, the guarantors of the Astana process. No interest, no cause can justify barbarism, ethnic cleansing, massacre of innocent people. On your behalf and on behalf of our Institution, I wish to make a solemn appeal for the immediate implementation of the UN Security Council Resolution. There is an urgent need for a lasting ceasefire, there is an urgent need for the protection of civilians, that the wounded and the sick are evacuated, that aid can be delivered. There is an urgent need for a political solution to be achieved within the framework of the Geneva process. All those who have influence must act to stop this tragedy. Humanity is in perdition in Syria, let us not lose ours. (Applause) I think this message from Strasbourg is a positive message for citizens who are in the midst of fighting, between fighters on one side and on the other. They are the victims: without weapons, they can't get out of town.

You have invited me here today to make a statement on behalf of the Commission on the Commission's integrity policy and its functioning, including with regard to the appointment of official Martin Selmayr as Secretary-General of the Commission on 1 March this year. First of all, allow me to explain the context. On 21 February, the Commission took a number of decisions concerning its senior management, in a so-called package. Why are we doing this anyway? We have a decision almost weekly on a larger number of Directorates-General that we know on our services, on a wide range of senior management positions. This would mean unrest in our service. That's why we do this regularly in the package. This is the only way to achieve a balanced overall development in the interests of our institution, for example in terms of different nationalities. We include seniority, age, pension maturity, and the objective of effectively increasing the proportion of women is also a priority. The last package was prepared by my predecessor. It was discussed and adopted by the College at the end of June 2015. Incidentally, in addition to numerous posts of Directors General and Deputies in the Commission, part of the package was the decision that Catherine Day ended her service and that Mr Italians became the new Secretary-General. In fact, at the end of June, a very similar package was to be decided, as was the decision on the current package a few weeks ago. We have an established procedure for this. Allow me to underline three points: we take these decisions on the basis of the European Union Statute. That is our right and our duty. And the same went we again this time. We took this decision by agreement and with the participation of portfolio commissioners, coordinating Vice-Presidents, myself and also the President. All the decisions of the College of 21 February were taken on my proposal, and the decision on the Secretary-General on the direct proposal of our President, just as the responsibility within the Commission. All decisions, including the decision on the new Secretary-General, were approved by consensus of all members of the Commission. May I refer to the minutes of the Commission meeting on 21 February, which we made public — as after each part-session, in accordance with our transparency rules. Secondly, I have no doubt — and it has not been called into question so far — that official Martin Selmayr has all the necessary qualifications for the role of Secretary-General of the European Commission. He has many years of experience in key positions in the Commission, he is an excellent lawyer, he has a high level of communication skills. It is certainly fully suitable for the task. Diligence, talent, qualifications, pro-European attitudes and also political flair are his own. In addition, he has the confidence of our President of the Commission, including my confidence and that of the entire College. With regard to the procedural issues raised publicly in recent days, it can be said that the procedure has also been fully and over time within the framework of this package and then when Martin Selmayr was transferred to the post of Secretary-General, in accordance with Article 7 of the Staff Regulations. First the call for proposals by the Deputy Secretary General, then an assessment center, an external evaluation of candidates, the interview with the Advisory Committee within the Commission and then the interview with the President and with myself one day before the decision. It was a correct selection according to the rules of the Statute, which I also had to secure and ensured as the Commissioner responsible for personnel matters. In the selection of a Secretary-General, neither nationality nor membership of any party, if given. The only focus is on enabling this Office to ensure the best possible functioning of our Authority and to guarantee the work of the President of the Commission. And we consider the candidate, the elected official Martin Selmayr, to be fully suitable for this. In short, we can show you that the formal rules were respected, the procedure corresponded to the same and that the candidate also fully meets our expectations for qualification. That is why we would like to ask you to monitor this decision in this way, but then to accept it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 36, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Françoise GROSSETÊTE", "mepid": "2025", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (FR) Mr President, Commissioner, there is an indisputable principle: it is within the power of a president to make appointments to highly strategic and political positions.

Commissioner, thank you for giving us all the explanations, because any appointment should not be a seized power of the senior administration, in defiance of the rules of procedure or through small arrangements between friends, because in this case, what better to feed anti-elite discourse, what better to give Grind to Euroskeptics and maintain the myth of a technocratic Europe headed behind closed doors? In 2014, our group committed to a Europe that is more political, less technocratic, more transparent, closer to the citizen, with a Political Committee taking over administration. Unfortunately, the matter we are debating tonight suggests to our fellow citizens that unelected officials would de facto take over the reins of the institution, with the nose and beard of commissioners who were warned at the last minute. Frankly, we shoot ourselves a bullet in the foot! On the contrary, the legitimacy of senior officials of the Commission, whose competence is undoubtedly, would be reinforced by transparent and fair appointment procedures. However, this affair throws discredit on an entire institution, of which we know is made up largely of talented professionals who are committed to advancing the European project. The European institutions do not belong to senior officials, they belong to European citizens.

We live in times of Brexit, at times when populists of all stripes are working around the clock to challenge the European project. Actions such as the transport of Mr Selmayr, which give the impression to the outside world that regulations are being stretched to the utmost to fill certain positions with certain people, do not only produce question marks in the eyes of citizens.

I have no special information, everything I have comes from open sources, from the media. Is it true that on 19 February, when Heads of Cabinet met to prepare a College meeting, no mention of the appointment was on the agenda or under any other business, while on 21 February it was there? And that the whole procedure for the appointment of the Secretary-General took just nine minutes, where Mr Selmayr was first appointed Deputy Secretary-General, then the Secretary-General of the European Commission resigned, and then Mr Selmayr was appointed as the Secretary-General? My second question: was he the only candidate, or were there more candidates? My third question, again from the media: is it true that the minutes of the 21 February Commission meeting were amended to include a discussion about the merits of non-existent multiple candidates? Mr Commissioner, there is a lot of interest surrounding that appointment and I think that you should do your best to come out with something which is trustworthy, and you should avoid any feeling or any impression that it was a pre-prepared, politically motivated nomination.

Telling us about the wonderful new clothes of the emperor and expecting us to believe it is a stupid strategy, and it just underlines the point that I want to make here today. Today’s debate is not about staff policy; it is about the total lack of political judgment of this Commission and that also applies to the absence of Mr Juncker, who likes to talk about his political Commission, but politics also means political accountability. He should be here to be held accountable for a political decision.  I am left completely speechless at the scene of 28 powerful politicians, selected for the political leadership of this continent but led by the nose by a civil servant. The political Commission of Mr Juncker sheepishly signing on the dotted line. Yes, Commissioner Oettinger, that is what you’ve been doing. If the Commissioners are so easily intimidated by a civil servant, if they act like helpless children when confronted with an unexpected staff decision, then how can we expect them to stand up for the European interests against Trump, for example, in a trade war, or resist pressures from powerful lobbies, or be firm with national governments that violate EU rules?  Maybe that part of the House could have the courtesy to hear me out… (Speaker is pointing to the right) Selmayrgate destroys all the credibility of the European Union as a champion of integrity and transparency in public administration. At a time when public trust in the European project is low, this is devastating, Commissioner Oettinger, and the fact that the Commission has remained deaf to date to criticism shows how disconnected it is from reality.  In conclusion, the Commission will have to choose what is more important: the career of Mr Selmayr or the credibility of the European Union. The appointment of Mr Selmayr was a grave error and it must be corrected, and that is a precondition for our continued support for this Commission.

There is also one final question, a very important question: how is it that the 27 Commissioners were so benevolent in these indecent manipulations of the procedure?

Because if they are politicians — something that President Juncker has repeatedly reiterated — how they respond for their conduct to the citizens who have not elected them but who suffer their own decisions? Politicians, especially those at the head of institutions, must act with integrity, discipline, honour, always behave ethically blameless. All their acts must not only be, but also appear blameless. There can be no doubt about their surgery. So where, in this case, are the ethics and transparency, which you, Commissioner, mentioned before? What are the mechanisms of political sanction in the face of these attitudes and behaviours, given that neither you, Commissioner Oettinger, or even President Juncker, have been directly elected by citizens, and is not an individual motion of no confidence expected?

Please remove from me that I have a great deal of respect for the Commission, but also personally, for the importance of Parliament, not arrogant here, do not want to treat you as young children, take your questions seriously and also look forward to the investigation with great seriousness and serenity. Let us pay mutual respect. Secondly, fraud, corruption, scandal, intrigue, personal benefits: this has been assued by some speakers. That is why, I have the utmost interest in an objective investigation in and through the Committee on Budgetary Control. All questions will be answered there. Questions received in writing by 5 March — the date of the postmark — will be answered within the deadline of 14 March, separate from today's relatively short consultation period. Why am I here? Because that is exactly what the Conference of Presidents decided. It was your high house, it was your president, it was your group chairmen who, disagreeing on the ECR and the GUE, said by a large majority 'Oettingers Portfolio', so the Oettinger has to come here. That's why I'm here. I am sure that if the Conference of Presidents wanted to speak to my President, he would be present. This means that I am here because the Conference of Presidents, your conference in preparation, expected this from the Commission. We meet your expectations. Secretary General Martin Selmayr spoke as a grey bureaucrat. This German Selmayr — no one knows him. I'm quoting! My request is that discrimination is not acceptable in Europe. Officials should not be discriminated against in any way. If a monster is written in the press, it's up to the free press. But I think every official, small or large official, has enough Worthy care and respect from all of us. It is said that the Germans will once again dominate Europe with this decision. I often hear the following in Germany: why is each Member State represented by a Commissioner? Why do even the smallest Member States like the big ones have a Commissioner? I think it's right. I believe that every Member State should be represented on an equal footing in the Court of Justice, in the Court of Auditors, in the Commission. But please take it from me: in the large Member States it is already being asked why only one in 28 or that in this House the small Member States have a Member of Parliament representing 90 thousand inhabitants, while in the large Member States one Member has nine hundred thousand inhabitants. One man, one vote. Nevertheless, I think it is right that Malta and Luxembourg are represented by six Members. But I would like to make it clear here that we are all on the issue of fair representation of our Member States, of nationality... (interrogation) I also listened to you, Madam President. If you want to ask a question, please. Otherwise, I would ask you to give your questions in an orderly and comprehensive manner... I come to all the questions, Madam. It's been 20 questions. You'll also notice that I'm trying to answer your questions. One after another, patience and respect. The question of nationality is completely secondary to me. I feel like a European citizen who is one of 28 in the Commission. I believe that this is why the question of where you were born and the passport date should be of less importance. It has been said that the Commission was not elected. I strongly disagree with that. A candidate for Commissioner is proposed by his democratically elected government. He is grilled by this high house on the expert committee. He is chosen by this House. It is elected by the European Council. I know many member states where you can will become a national minister without the national parliament being involved at all. If, for example, the chancellor is elected in Germany in two days' time — the ministers will be appointed by the parties and confirmed by the President. No choice, no hearing, nothing — as in the European Parliament, for example. That is why I maintain that the Commission complies with democratic principles more than many other bodies at national level. I can tell you that this Commission had no intention and does not intend to organise company cars, drivers and offices for all Commissioners after leaving the Commission. I think this is fake news. We have set it out on several occasions, and I can assure you here that, under my responsibility, there is no proposal to change anything about this subject with regard to all the Commissioners after their departure. It has been said by some Members that the rules according to the letter may have been respected. First of all, letters are the basis for keeping rules. That is why I look forward to the reviews. We fully complied with all the rules after the letter. This is doubted by some. Let's check that. I am very happy to answer your questions here. But this statute on how to carry out promotions, appointments in the Commission, is not a presidential statute. The Statute on the basis of which Martin Selmayr was appointed Secretary-General is a statute adopted by this House and the Council. It's your statute, it's your letters, it's your rules. If you want to change them, we need to talk about it. Sorry, the staff regulations and what the Council has decided have emerged in the democratic bodies of the Council and Parliament! This can be changed. But these appointments do not happen after arbitrariness of the Commission, but on the basis of the following points: and also in the spirit of what has been decided and decided in the European democratic fora. We have three options for deciding on the filling of positions and appointing them: the internal tender, the external tender and the transfer within the service. All three — internal call for tenders, external tendering and transfer — are provided for in our Articles of Association. Officer Martin Selmayr was Head of Cabinet of our President for three years. And this is exactly what, Head of Cabinet, corresponds to the level of Directors-General, while head of cabinet of a commissioner corresponds to the level of directors. That is why, over the past three years, he has carried out and fulfilled with your knowledge a task that will enable him to take up the post of Secretary General in accordance with the method we have used. We should not build a distorted picture of Mr Selmayr either. He's not a party man, nor is he a monster, nor is he incapable. That is why my request is to give him a chance in the task execution in the next few months with your strict eye! I am sure he will perform the task excellently, and this as someone who is a service provider to President Juncker and to the Commission. I don't think distorting images are appropriate here in any form. If you don't like him, if you don't trust him, say it! But no one here has given this House a negative opinion on his qualifications and work skills and his various positions in recent years. We will gladly address ourselves to the Committee on Budgetary Control and will also answer written questions. I myself am also ready to come to any of your bodies, to your group meetings, including the bilateral talks, and I will be happy to take some time to answer all your concerns and questions in the coming weeks through clear answers with regard to the European Statute and the law on the European Statute. satisfaction of all questioners.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 71, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "The debate is closed.

This “Blitzkrieg” method of appointing Mr. Selmayr, who orchestrated his own selection procedure, the legitimacy of which is questionable at best, is a little reminiscent of the case of former Commissioner Kallas. The latter was himself at the source of a set of transparency rules, which led to the creation of the transparency register, but a couple of months after his term as a Commissioner, he simultaneously held positions as special advisor to the Commissioner Dombrovskis and consultant at a private-sector software company Nortal, without having himself or Nortal registered in the transparency register. These, and many other Commission’s gimmicks, where they claimed having done things “by the book”, are becoming increasingly detrimental to the integrity of the EU institutions and will be scrutinised in the Parliament’s CONT Committee.

This report is the result of a relationship between women and I hope that this will also emerge from the text. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, the staff of the Secretariat of the Committee, who contributed to the drafting of this report, the NGOs and the experts involved in the hearing, in particular the AIDOS association and the Stop TTIP Italia network, for the contribution they have made. I would also like to thank very much the Feminist collective Nine, whose manifesto commits me to try to make a difference in this institution as well, and the worldwide feminist movement Not One Less, dropped in the square also last March 8th, for the strength it gives to everyone and to each, including myself. When this parliamentary term began, a report we commissioned to the Committee on International Trade called the EU's trade policy “gender-blind”, and gave us some indications on how to make her “gender-sensitive”. In the report I was rapporteur in 2016 — report on social and environmental norms, human rights and corporate responsibility and their impact in international trade policies — we were already trying to call for a reversal of the Union's trade policy, a reversal of course that would make human rights clauses binding, and not subject to those clauses which instead protect the profit and rights of investors. In that report, we called for human, social and environmental rights to be defined not simply non-tariff barriers, but precisely central elements, which should also be safeguarded in trade policy. In this report we are concerned with those basic human rights which are women's rights. Gender equality is an expected universal goal by international instruments and also the fundamental treaties of the European Union, which should commit itself to promoting and ensuring gender equality in its political actions, and therefore also in politics commercial. I would recall that among the broader objectives of the United Nations, the Sustainable Development Goals, and in particular Objective 5, stipulate that gender equality, the emancipation of women and girls must be reached by 2030. None of this is yet fully present in the EU's trade policy, and this report is speaking in this direction. According to estimates, only 20% of trade agreements mention women's rights, while the European Union is ratifying negotiations or negotiating treaties including services, and therefore more than previous trade agreements are intertwined with human rights and women's rights. I come to some of the main points of this report, which has not been difficult to lay down, given the different political souls that have worked to find a summary. The points, I am sure, will be explained in more detail by my colleague Malin Björk; what I want to say, however, very rightly at the conclusion of this speech, is that I hope that this can be a To change from a feminist point of view — which is a point of view that calls for justice, not only for women and girls, but for all — the trade policy of the European Union, which cannot be governed solely by the logic of competition and profit.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 75, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Malin BJÖRK", "mepid": "124992", "text": " rapporteur. — Madam President! From the left, we want trade policy to contribute to a more equitable distribution of the world's resources and wealth. We want it to help stop climate change, to strengthening democracy — and all that we are working on. But with this report we wanted to focus on the situation of women and on gender equality. International trade policy is an important part of our economic policy. It is an important part of our foreign policy. Trade policy concerns fundamental issues of democracy, human rights, workers' rights, issues of consumer safety, public health issues, basic climate and environment provisions. All these parts also touch on gender equality and the situation of women. Trade policy is not gender neutral. Women are affected differently than men depending on their position in the economy, depending on whether it is an export-oriented economy, whether it is a more agriculture-oriented economy, depending on the state of employment, etc. We address all this in our report. We believe that there is no longer enough slogans such as that we should export democracy or we should export equality, human rights or sustainable development or any of the areas that we care so much about. We need to formulate tools and have steering instruments so that it becomes a reality of what we say as well and so that our negotiators focus on the right things and know what expectations we have of them. International trade policy has rested a little bit on a premeditated view, which means that all the demands of the environment and human rights or equality have received the answer that 'yea, they don't belong here, you get them fixed elsewhere with some other tools or in another negotiation'. We mean that time must be up. Trade policy is an exclusive competence that Member States have given to the EU. Therefore, it is extra important and reasonable that we discuss and review and set up frameworks for how we wants future agreements to look like. In this effort we have had tremendous support from civil society, women's organisations and MRI organisations. We've gained expertise, and we've had deliberations and hearings. I would like to thank my co-rapporteur Mr Eleonora Forenza, but also my shadow rapporteurs. We have had different centres of gravity and partly different entrances, but those who took on this mission from their respective groups were clearly the ones most interested in seeing and analysing the impact on women and formulating constructive criticism and suggestions. For that, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs. I am not going to go through all the individual elements of the report, but I would like to highlight some of the most important elements. As Forenza has said, we want to see a gender equality chapter with the objectives of women's rights and on women's economic empowerment — objectives that must be based on the Beijing platform that is supposed to have equality experts and civil society involved in its follow-up, and we shall have a review of compliance with this chapter. We also want the EU's trade policy to combat exploitation and aim to improve working conditions for women in the export industry, whether in agriculture, textile industry or elsewhere. We believe that ILO standards and UN sustainability goals are central to this. We also believe that there should be binding provisions on respect for human rights, democracy, working conditions and the environment. Trade policy must not undermine access to public services, education, health, including sexual and reproductive health and rights. We also believe that the UN Women's Convention SIDO should be part of the trade agreements and that the EU itself should join. We want to see due diligence in a real way for businesses. As I said, I would like to thank my co-rapporteur, my colleagues and the shadow rapporteurs. Here, then, are some of the things our report calls for if we want EU trade policy to live up to both global needs and expectations. I now look forward to the Commission moving from word to action, including in terms of gender equality in trade policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 76, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, let me first thank Parliament, the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality (FEMM) and the Committee on International Trade (INTA), and, of course, the co-rapporteurs Ms Malin Björk and Ms Eleonora Forenza, for the attention, the work and the time that they have invested in this report on Gender Equality in EU Trade Agreements. It makes a very valuable contribution to strengthening gender aspects in EU trade policy. The Commission is committed to gender equality. EU trade policy already contributes to this goal through some of its instruments, for example, its sustainability impact assessments, the Generalised System of Preferences, the GSP+ and the Trade and Sustainable Development Chapters of the European Union’s free trade agreements. However, we need to do more.  To gather input from stakeholders, in June last year the Commission and the International Trade Centre organised an International Forum on Women and Trade, to which the honourable Members Mosca, Rodríguez-Piñero and Forenza kindly contributed as speakers. The Commission has already put some of the ideas that emerged from this event into practice, and I can assure you that we will continue to do so.  The report identifies a lack of adequate data on trade and gender equality when it comes to determining the impact of trade policy instruments on women. In cooperation with other international organisations, for example the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the International Trade Centre, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the OECD or the European Institutes for Gender Equality, we are exploring how to better collect and use data on the impact of trade policy instruments on women. We are also looking to improve our analysis by using the most advanced methods, like the UNCTAD toolbox on trade and gender. Following a suggestion from this House, the Commission and the International Trade Centre are also launching a collection of firm level data on women entrepreneurship and female employment in EU-exporting and importing firms.  Let me mention some further activities to contribute to the promotion of women’s economic empowerment: the European Union’s recently reviewed Aid for Trade strategy introduces, for all its projects, the requirement of a systematic gender analysis. We are currently working with Chile on gender-specific provisions in the context of modernisation of the existing EU-Chile Association Agreement. These provisions will include commitments to effectively implement relevant international legal instruments on gender equality, such as the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women and a structured framework for cooperating and sharing best practices on women in international trade. The Commission will keep the INTA Committee informed about the development of the EU proposals for these provisions on trade and gender. In the international arena, the EU actively supported the adoption of the Joint Declaration on Trade and Women’s Economic Empowerment on the occasion of the WTO Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires in December 2017. The Declaration seeks to remove barriers to and foster women’s economic empowerment. We now need to move ahead with implementation. The Commission is ready to sponsor several follow-up actions, such as organising workshops, collecting data on women’s participation in international trade, and applying a gender lens to our trade-related technical assistance.

Fourthly, women belong to the negotiating table when it comes to agreements. Fifth, women are part of the team that controls the agreements on a daily basis.

Every country of the European Union lacks children who are our future. There are no children, because people often selfishly choose a comfortable life without worries or those children were killed before they were born on behalf of sexual and reproductive rights. Abortions make Europe have a future at risk. Nor is there any mention in this document of the need to support families with children. By giving birth to children, the development of our society will also be ensured in the future. But often it is customary in European Union legislation that this report deals with allowing a woman to enter the labour process as soon as possible, regardless of what she wants and what her family needs. If a woman wants to stay home and take care of our future, that is, the next generation of children, she faces prejudice. A woman caring for children or other family member is often discriminated against and faces poverty. If she remains in a blessed state and is without the support of her husband or partner, abortion is a terrible way out for her. I think that this philosophy does not work in Europe, it brings us great problems, and it has to be said: Europe is dying. With this report, I think we want to export the culture of death to third countries through trade treaties.

Let us not forget that the number of years needed to achieve parity continues to grow and is already 52 years old.

The world's employed population is 72 per cent for men, compared with 47 per cent for women, who enter only 77 per cent of men's wages and are mostly active in the informal economy.

I think some of my colleagues here have said what this report actually started with: the question of trade for whom and for what? And the answer coming back is that it is not neutral. It is certainly not neutral when it comes to women.

We are all familiar with the figures: from the age of 15, one in three women in Europe has been a victim of physical violence, sexual violence or both; 55% of women are victims of sexual harassment. Violence against women is a violation of human rights. The Commission takes the fight against this very seriously, which is why we made 2017 the year of action to combat violence against women. In June 2017 the EU signed the Council of Europe’s Istanbul Convention on the prevention and protection of victims of gender-based violence. The Commission’s intention is to conclude full EU ratification as soon as possible. I would like to thank the European Parliament for constantly speaking out alongside the Commission about the importance of ratifying the Council of Europe Convention on prevention and protection of victims of gender-based violence. Despite the fact that all EU countries have signed the Convention and 17 have so far ratified it, we see strong opposition against ratification in a few countries. The Convention has generated very intense public debates where there have been misconceptions and misleading arguments. For example, these concern the use and translation of the term ‘gender’. They concern the fear that ratifying the Convention would mean forcing states to allow same-sex marriage or to introduce a new refugee status for transgender or intersex persons. Let me be very clear on this. The Convention is about preventing and combating violence against women without other hidden purposes. It is not an instrument for shaping gender perceptions or ideologies. It applies to women who become victims of violence simply because they are women. The Convention does not oblige states to allow same-sex marriage. In fact, no reference is made to the legal recognition of same-sex marriages: this subject is outside of the scope of the Convention. It also does not oblige states to have their schools give lessons about sexual orientation or gender identity. Nowhere in the Convention is it stated that a new refugee status should be established for transgender or intersex persons or for any other group. The Convention requires parties to introduce a gender-sensitive perspective into the examination of asylum requests to take into account why and how women experience persecution – for example, the risk of female genital mutilation. I sincerely hope that those Member States that still have doubts about joining the Convention will consider its fundamental purpose: to prevent violence against women and to support and protect those women who fall victim to violence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 107, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, six months ago, we were here adopting EU accession to the Istanbul Convention with a large majority. Today, we are here again. We are not going to quit until women are free from violence. The Convention is the only binding treaty that criminalises violence against women and domestic violence. It defines violence done to a woman just because she is a woman, based on sexism and discrimination. It is about women being harassed, beaten up, raped or killed, and girls forced to marry or mutilated. It is not about any ideology or religion.  Last June, I proudly represented Parliament at the signature of the EU accession to the Convention, a historic step towards preventing those horrible crimes, combating impunity and protecting victims. Since then, Estonia, Cyprus and Germany have ratified it, and now we urge the 11 remaining Member States to ratify it. There has been much misrepresentation of the Convention, for instance, in Bulgaria, Croatia, Poland, Slovakia, and even Ukraine. The Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights recently clarified that the arguments pretending that the word ‘gender’ has hidden purposes are simply not true. He said that it means the socially constructed roles and behaviours that a society considers appropriate for women and men. It is about combating stereotypes. It is not against the traditional family. It is violence that endangers families, not the Convention.  Today, we call on the EU and the Council of Europe to do more, in dialogue with Member States, on the issue of gender, engaging with civil society, religious groups and women NGOs, we call on the Presidency to put this issue on the agenda of the European Council for as long as it takes, and we call on Bulgaria to reopen the ratification process. There is no other gender equality issue worth discussing for as long as women continue to be abused.

It's deplorable. National debates have been distorted by false arguments and misconceptions. No, the term “gender” does not contain any hidden ideology, but it describes the phenomenon of gender-based violence that targets women because they are women.

The Istanbul Convention is the best modern tool for combating violence against women, the gold standard of anti-overpower policy, the ready roadmap for building national anti-violence programs. This convention was signed by all countries in the European Union and the majority ratified it. And since Poland — my country — was mentioned earlier in the context of gender discussions, I would like to inform you that Poland has signed and ratified the convention as one of the first countries. We had a gender discussion, but most of us were convinced that this convention should be signed and ratified because it is of value. A key part of the convention, which constitutes its distinguished position among similar documents, is the chapter on prevention. It talks about preventing violence against women, combining this prevention of violence with equality. This relationship is very clear: the more equality, the less violence. Against the background of high ratings of the Convention as a road map in combating violence, and in the context of the equality thread, it is incomprehensible for me that the European Union, which is the world leader in promoting equality between women and men, has signed this convention to a very narrow extent. Thus, the European Union, represented by the Commission and the Council, has not itself abdicated from its functions as guardian and promoter of equality, although the Treaty, particularly the Charter of Fundamental Rights, gives the Union considerable powers in this regard.

My problem is whether we really know what the figure is, because a lot of women endure violence and are afraid to say. They fear precisely that they will not be further assaulted. 2017 was the year of combating violence, we have an improvement compared to the last years. It is very important to go to the cause. I believe that, in fact, the cause of violence is education, and I believe that we do not do enough, none of the Member States, for education, especially in rural areas, where women, in particular, suffer violence. And then we have another problem: in very many Member States, we do not have the protection of women, victims, we do not have shelters, we do not have measures taken against men who commit violence against women. So that's the thing, and I think we need to go with concrete steps to resolve it. Ratification is not enough. We have enough directives, laws, regulations that don't apply.

However, the initiator of the signing and ratification of the Convention was the Polish government, supported by the Polish Sejm and civil society, engaged in anti-movement activities, and the main opponent - the hierarchical Catholic Church, which issued official statements on “gender ideology”, as well as MPs from the right of the political scene.

The regulation started out as a proposal in 2016 as part of the European Commission’s Digital Single Market Strategy, with the objective of helping to boost cross-border e—commerce by improving parcel delivery. Thanks to the hard work of many MEP colleagues and staff, the Commission and the Estonian Presidency, we have a provisionally agreed text today. I urge everyone to support this text in the form of the new cross-border parcels regulation in tomorrow’s vote. The initial aims of the regulation were to help secure a more efficient parcel sector, increase transparency of tariffs, and assess prices where necessary. Together, I believe we have secured these aims and also added a stronger focus on consumer needs and the interests of small- and medium-sized enterprises when ordering goods from other EU countries. As emphasised in recital 2 of this regulation, Article 14 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union highlights the place occupied by services of general economic interest, such as postal and parcel services, in the shared values of the Union, as well as their role in promoting social and territorial cohesion.  The main elements of the regulation are as follows: we have agreed to expand the scope of key provisions to a certain extent where necessary to all cross-border parcel delivery service providers, not just those designated as providing a universal service. This is right, especially since universal service providers do not always have a large share of the cross-border parcels market. The regulation also covers multinationals and newer players in the parcel sector, including those with alternative business models. On the provision of information to national regulators, Article 4 applies not only to cross—order parcel operators, but to all parcel delivery companies, other than those with fewer than 50 persons working for them. Regulators can also, where justified, include smaller companies with between 25 and 49 workers. As part of this duty, parcel companies will give information each year on the employment status of workers delivering parcels, along with details of the sub-contractors they use. This, in my view, will help to expose the activities of some businesses who do not give their parcel workforce proper terms and conditions of employment, and instead require them to operate on a self-employed or precarious basis. It is encouraging that this aspect of the regulation has been particularly welcomed by trade unions. Rules on cross-border parcel tariffs in Articles 5 and 6 empower and enable national authorities more specifically to monitor delivery prices and assess cross-border prices that they deem unreasonably high. Whilst the regulation does not impose a cap on prices, it will allow users more easily to compare domestic and cross-border tariffs. Parcel companies will have to disclose prices ,and these will be published by the Commission on a dedicated website. Where parcel delivery is subject to universal service obligations, authorities will have a clearer power to investigate further, where necessary, taking into account the likely impact of prices, including on anyone who is disabled or who has reduced mobility, and smaller companies and citizens in remote areas.  The factors that authorities shall take into account in any assessment also include any relevant costs, quality of service standards and volumes, as well as tariffs of comparable parcel delivery services providers. The existence of price regulation and abuses of dominant market position may also be taken into account, if necessary. These provisions have been drafted, as has the regulation as a whole – and I emphasise this point with care – to make sure that the principles of the Postal Services Directive are not undermined or contradicted. In line with the 2011 Consumer Rights Directive, Article 7 of this regulation emphasises that consumers are to be provided with proper information on delivery options and charges payable and complaints-handling policies, where applicable. Given the concrete evidence on problems with parcel deliveries in quite a few cases, I would have preferred this provision to be stronger, but it is still a good start. There is indeed plenty of evidence on problems with parcel deliveries. Finally, I am pleased that the Commission is working with the support of Parliament on a comprehensive study on parcel delivery, and the regulation underlines that standardisation work should include environmental considerations and require a first review two years after entry into force, including on affordability, consumer protection and standards issues.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 152, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Biljana BORZAN", "mepid": "112748", "text": "Rapporteur for the opinion of the IMCO Committee. — Mr. President, about 11 million packages are delivered every day in the European Union.

Thanks to your hard work, we were able to reach an agreement on this regulation on cross-border parcel delivery services last December. It is an important step for eCommerce and the Digital Single Markets.  Today’s rules do not support cross-border eCommerce. 68% of internet users in the European Union shopped online last year, but only 33% of these e—shoppers bought goods or services from sellers based in another EU country. 17% of SMEs in the European Union sold online in 2016, but only 7.5% of SMEs did so across borders.  High delivery prices are one of the reasons why the potential of cross-border eCommerce still remains untapped in the European Union. They are a major concern for consumers and companies, especially SMEs. Delivery prices vary a lot across Europe, often without justification. On average, someone who sends a two-kilogram parcel to another EU country pays three to five times more than the domestic price. In some cases, it is much higher – up to 22 times as high. With this new regulation, we are addressing these issues through more price transparency and a stronger role for regulators. A month ago, I was here for the debates on the regulation against unjustified geo-blocking.

A fully integrated European internal market for consumers also includes the fact that products purchased across borders also come to customers, safely and cost-effectively.

To give just one example: how can it be that a package from Brussels to Aachen is about four times as expensive as a package from Munich to Berlin, even though that is four times ahead? It soon becomes apparent what is at stake. In any case, this has nothing to do with national wage structures or transport costs. We already have the impression that some providers take advantage of people having no sense of what a cross-border package can cost. That is why the central objective of this regulation is to create price transparency, particularly for consumers, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are particularly suffering from excessive prices, but which also want to take advantage of the opportunities of the internal market in Internet trade. We in the Group of the European People's Party will support this agreement. I would like to thank the rapporteur.

This creates enormous opportunities, and it is important that it does so throughout the European Union.

So we have taken an important step in this direction, even though – if it were up to me – we would have gone even further. I am glad that the proposals that I made in terms of the scope – and that is single piece parcel services’ tariffs – has been taken on board, because that will in fact enable us to compare like with like. Every single operator, regardless of size, will have to make his or her tariffs public, and they can then be independently reviewed, if need be, by national regulators.  If anyone expected that parcels would be cheaper tomorrow, this is bad news, but we have made significant progress towards greater transparency, more competition and more clarity for consumers in the future.

In terms of privatisation and the impact of privatisation, I do agree in principle with the colleague from the GUE/NGL Group, Mr Pimenta Lopes.

In doing so, consumers and small businesses in the EU raise concerns mainly when it comes to cross-border delivery of goods and relatively high postal costs, which, of course, raises the final price. Studies have shown that the prices of cross-border packages are on average three times higher than domestic prices. Approximately 40% of the price of cross-border packages cannot be explained by economic factors such as labour costs.

The reason I took on this report was really to save the Swedish model of education. We have our transport high schools, where Swedish students are allowed to take driver's licenses, learn how to drive a truck and learn the basics. Once you get the licence, you go to an established ride to accompany everyday work and learn how it works to be a driver. It's the quickest way to learn the profession. There was then a proposal from the Commission that it should not be allowed to do in this way in professional transport. Surely the reason for that was that it was thought it was going to be a form of wage dumping where inexperienced drivers would drive more cheaply. This is not the case in this model of education, however, but here you have an experienced and routine driver as a supervisor who sits alongside and is with the pupil all days. This way the learner also gains very quick insight into how working as a driver works. Another thing that I'm very happy because I got through is what we call electric powered distribution cars. Thus, smaller trucks of 3.5 tonnes will be allowed in future to drive with a B licence and a total weight of up to 4,250 kg. As I see it, it was necessary to do this because when you replace the petrol or diesel engine with an electric motor and a comparatively heavy battery then you have no load capacity left on those cars. Now we have arranged this by allowing B driving licences up to 4,250 kg. I also put forward a proposal on extreme weather conditions, which, as a driver, is quite important to have knowledge of. I myself, as many know, have a background in the transport industry and know what an awkward winter road team might look like. In Norway for example, you have big concerns. Those are very special conditions. There is a legal requirement to bring snow chains on the truck. However, there is no requirement to know how to assemble the snow chains on the truck. Then After all, it doesn't help much if you have the equipment with you but do not have the knowledge of how to use it. So we have also got that into the new, updated proposal. I am also pleased that we received a proposal to start work on setting up an EU register to help police get a tool to detect fake driving licences. It has become increasingly common for national police in different member countries to stop cars and can quickly find that it is a forged licence. This is a big problem. You can log in and order really any authorisation you want, and at a cost of between EUR 300 and 400, a couple of weeks later you get a licence home in the mailbox which is quite impossible for a police patrol to be able to determine at a road check whether it is false or don't. If we get this database in order, we have given national police authorities a tool to detect the fake driving licences and, in that way, create higher security also on our roads.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 179, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, the Commission very much welcomes the agreement reached on this proposal in December here in Strasbourg.

I am particularly pleased that in the negotiations all sides followed the rationale and the key objective of the Commission’s proposal, primarily to strengthen the safety on our roads. We should always keep in mind, why we are doing all this. Every year, too many families have to deal with the terrible effects of the severe injuries inflicted to a quarter of a million people because of traffic accidents. Even worse, every year more than 25 000 people die on EU roads. That is a bus load every day. The Commission is strongly engaged with the Member States and also with you, in the Parliament, to turn this situation around and stop this silent killer on our roads. This piece of legislation will be another important element in the reinvigorated road safety framework we are putting in place. We all agree that it is imperative that we have a high level of standards and requirements when it comes to professional qualifications of those that drive heavy goods vehicles (HGVs). The impact of those crashes are very severe. Our rules are already good, but they certainly will be further improved. The agreement we have reached on this proposal certainly brings these necessary changes that will make the regime even more effective. In brief, we are satisfied that in the future our system for professional qualifications will bring the following four key benefits: first, training of professional drivers will have a much stronger road safety dimension to it, with a particular emphasis on how to take care of vulnerable road users; second, the mutual recognition of training across the EU is facilitated for the benefit of drivers and companies; third, the content and organisation of the training will be updated to take into account the ongoing technological developments and new realities such as distraction; and fourth, I also welcome the electronic exchange of information, which will facilitate the mobility of drivers and the enforcement of the training obligations.

This Directive will improve the training of driving professionals in professional transport and bring it closer to their needs today in a sector that is in profound transformation thanks to the evolution of vehicles, roads and regulations. The incorporation of issues such as driving in extreme weather conditions, environmentally efficient driving or those that need to be developed in particularly congested areas undoubtedly adds safety to roads. In addition, the influence of drivers on the profitability of the service they provide increases. Finally, it will help to equate competition conditions in the internal market. These factors, combined, will improve the social and employment position of these professionals in the transport sector's value chain. Our main objective during the negotiations has therefore been to facilitate ongoing training and retraining processes through technological tools or in-vehicle training processes. At the same time, we want to anticipate the needs of a sector that is already experiencing a real revolution with new information and communications technologies and the emergence of new vehicles with clean propellants and other autonomy and maintenance features. Finally, we regret that we have failed to completely eliminate the derogations which are going to derogate from the scope of this Directive to those carrying out shipments as part of their own business activity in the primary sector on journeys of less than 50 kilometres.

Neither the report on the implementation of the 2012 directive nor the ex-post impact assessment of 2014 state that as a result of the application of the measures there was an increase in road safety or a decrease in the number of road accidents. It is doubtful the need to train drivers in what they do every day, thus gaining practical experience. Traffic safety on roads would certainly be improved by improving driver conditions, higher quality of vehicles and better checks on their correctness, which we already have regulations. The aspiration to promote the profession is certainly established, but its success depends more on working conditions, working hours, wages, mobility and can be achieved through these forms of regulation before additional training that burden drivers and potentially distract young people from entering into profession.

The efficiency and safety of the road transport business rely heavily both on the quality of vehicles used and on the skills of the drivers employed by the transportation companies.

Following a 2012 evaluation report identified some shortcomings, the Commission proposed a legislative proposal to amend the Directive. The report is recommended to amend the Commission's proposal in several ways. For example, the focus is on efficient driving to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector (target to reduce emissions by 20% by 2030 compared to 2008). The opportunities offered by intelligent transport systems to reduce emissions, reduce the accident rate and develop a competitive European transport sector are also recognised. Member States should be provided with opportunities to harmonise their training practices. Such harmonisation should, however, exclude sensitive areas such as driving vehicles for the transport of dangerous goods, heavy goods, animals, etc. Driving licence cards should be issued in the prescribed form in order to ensure mutual recognition. According to the rapporteurs, carriers should be aware of the sources from which they can obtain information on the mandatory laws of the different Member States that affect them. Periodic training with a focus on road safety is required.

However, there is no area for the daily life of a European citizen or guests coming to us, which is not affected by this report, which I have taken care of in the last year and created by shadow-rapporters as a very well, well-coordinated team, which is the intelligent collaboration with each other is about a European strategy for transport systems. A previous speakers mentioned that in 2016 alone, 25 670 Europeans lost their lives in car accidents and 130 000 were injured. A revolutionary change in preventing, avoiding accidents and protecting human life can be the subject that is being discussed and brought to us by the Commission. Similarly, in the everyday life of the organisation of transport, whether we talk about the huge traffic jams on the amazing urban or motorways, or about pollution, it could also be a revolutionary change in the context of the can be implemented in its strategy. And let's add that it can significantly affect our everyday life, whether it's servicing the car, as we are talking about the invention of the nearest food, pizza, cafe. So everything that will be about connecting cars, as passengers, car users and roadside signalling systems in the future, and will later lead us to automatic transport, self-driving systems is somewhere in this strategy. Colleagues, progress and the development of technology are much faster than what we have already done in the European Union in our legislation, strategies or even in our support mechanisms. That is why I use the word once again that this is a revolutionary issue for all of us, how we can implement intelligent transport systems that cooperate with each other. We are talking about the connectivity of 30 million cars per year here in the European Union. Can you imagine what an amazing development, what revolutionary, technological novelty this will be in all of our lives? But let me mention one or two things that I will say that if someone reads the report and deepens it, they may understand better that we also need to deal with the amazing digital gaps in Europe within a region, let alone between countries. And in this report, we also take a long look at who and how the data in vehicles can be accessed, at the time of the development of interoperable transport systems, in whose hands our data file, the amazing amount of data about us, and for what purpose it can be used. Thank you very much to the colleagues who have contributed to my rap police, either in my own secretariat or in other factions as shadow-rapporters.

I think it is very good that we chose a technology-neutral approach to this because we must note that the fleet of vehicles is slowly regenerating, and that for a long time to come, we will be in a situation when we have existing vehicles, networked vehicles and potentially wholly self-driving vehicles and all of them need to be able to operate in traffic safely. That is, we need to take an approach where all technologies are able to work together. The second is about access to data.

New technologies, of which cooperative intelligent transport systems are part, require harmonization of legislation, so far confused and with ever-new problems.

This report could not have come at a better time. This quick deployment of EU-wide interoperable cooperative intelligent transport systems, better known as C-ITS, is the first milestone towards cooperative, connected and autonomous mobility. And cooperative connected an autonomous mobility – and here is yet another abbreviation – CCAM as we call it, is one of the priorities of the third mobility package that is coming out on 2 May this year. Let me pick up on a number of issues in the report that that are of particular importance for our current and future work. The report stresses that the C—ITS communication approach needs to be technology-neutral, based on hybrid communication and interoperable. I couldn’t agree more. As I said in the beginning, rapid deployment is of the essence. The ‘day—one’ services should aim at hitting the mass market in 2019. We must, therefore, build on existing technologies and provide investment security to the early adapters. New technologies such as 5G and satellite will become part of the hybrid communication mix as they become available. But if they are used to provide the same day-one services they must be deployed in a way that is compatible, otherwise the services wouldn’t work properly any more, and, most importantly, we wouldn’t reach our objective of making our transport system safer. I am also very pleased that the report recognises the key coordination role of C-Roads in implementing the C-ITS strategy. Our cooperation with the Member States within C-Roads is indeed instrumental in ensuring that C-ITS services are harmonised across borders. I am therefore proud to announce that the C-Roads family is now expanding to 16 Member States and three third-party countries, including Australia. Finally, I very much welcome the fact that the report mentions data protection and cyber security. Both are indeed required in order to make C—ITS reliable, safe and secure. This is why we intend to cover both areas in a delegated regulation based on the ITS Directive. I hope that we will be able to give you some more details on what to expect in the third mobility package, even if the adoption of the delegated regulation is only foreseen for the end of this year. C-ITS has great potential for all of us, for all of our citizens in terms of road safety and traffic efficiency. I am very pleased to hear and read that this House agrees with me that this is an area calling for EU leadership.

For policymakers it proves to be a difficult task to keep up with the speed of this rapid development. Therefore, it is important that the EU institutions make substantial efforts to contribute to a common European—wide perspective for the transport sector. Traffic is one of the most significant challenges faced by rapidly growing cites: congested roads are a strain on the environment, the economy and the overall quality of life. For this reason, the EU should encourage and support more research and innovation projects, including the Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS) to be able to deal with these problems.

A report highlighting the serious repercussions of the economic and financial crisis which have seriously damaged the growth of these regions: there are 47 in eight Member States, where 83 million live people. The report represents the continuity of a crucial initiative, launched in 2015 by Commissioner Crețu, which aims to bring a better understanding of the complexity of the challenges to which they must coping with these regions, characterized by internal structural weakness which makes them, or at least should make them, the biggest beneficiaries of cohesion policy. The path we took was difficult, because the positions of the various political groups differed widely, but I think we still managed to achieve a very good result, while sacrificing some passages in negotiations, to contemper of course the interest of everyone. We started from the understanding that the macroeconomic framework has a significant impact on regional growth and that the imbalances of the current crisis risk not only weakening economies, but also of to frustrate the spirit of solidarity that characterises the European context and the same principle as cohesion policy, which would thus be minimised its efforts, especially in these regions. We have tried to put to the Commission's attention a number of good practices, which aim to promote and increase growth in these regions, especially with regard to specificity territorial. This is, in my opinion, part of the vindication of our political role, and foreshadows solutions other than those identified by the Commission. If we want to be useful, then, we must overcome the ideological splints in which we are sometimes trapped, and that is why the report outlines three points for achieving this balance, a balance that is likely to be compromised otherwise between politics and economy, between cohesion and economic governance. The real node we have tried to dissolve is the definition of the relationship between cohesion policy and European economic policy, the principle of macroeconomic conditionality which endorses internal symmetries and external regions, and which should be reformed in a positive and constructive perspective in order to encourage and stimulate reforms, with the proper aim of investing in those territories presenting greater structural difficulties. We discuss the relationship between cohesion policy and European semester, which should provide country-specific recommendations as a stimulus to growth and not, on the contrary, in the form of a constraint. We must continue to reiterate and highlight the importance of cohesion policy, an essential tool for correcting imbalances of competitiveness, and which should continue to grant funding ambitious for the benefit of these regions, representing a priority for the European Union. In this context, Member States must play a key role, including by adopting national strategies designed ad hoc for the growth of these regions which are penalised by serious structural deficiencies. As the report states, we must therefore continue to invest in infrastructure and education, expanding and improving relations between businesses and educational institutions. Conditionalities should be focused, before respecting macroeconomic parameters, on respecting the fundamental values of coexistence and solidarity. This is crucial to creating effective European added value for citizens through actions to strengthen economic, social and territorial cohesion, which must always be our objective.

The discussion I heard here in Parliament is very meaningful to me. Firstly, because most of you know that lagging regions were one of my top priorities since I became Commissioner so I think it is very important to underline that in the Treaty we have this goal to fill the gaps to reduce disparities, and that is why we are creating these studies on lagging regions to see why so many regions are still stagnating despite the economic growth, despite the fact that we have lower unemployment. We still have regions which are not growing and we do not see results in creating jobs and growth.  I very much welcome the main finding of these reports. It favourably echoes what the Commission strives to underline in its own report on lagging regions and, after listening to the debate, I think overall we share the same views that the social and economic situation of these lagging regions is multi—faceted. It cannot be addressed through a one—size—fits—all policy. On the contrary, as you said here, it requires regionally—differentiated investments and policy responses.  This is why, as you know, in the analysis carried out, two groups of lagging regions were identified: low-income regions, mostly in the eastern periphery of the European Union, and low-growth regions in southern Europe. The pilot project we launched in parallel to complement the analytical strength, namely in test regions in Poland and in Romania, have allowed us to propose hands-on solutions to tackle structural bottlenecks. In Poland, the ‘Catching Up’ region initiative has helped, for example, to improve the conditions for starting a business, the management of financial instruments, or special planning practices. In Romania, tailor—made specialisation strategies and action plans were elaborated, as well as project pipelines in sectors like biomedicine or agro—food.  I have followed closely all the discussions REGI Committee on our report and on the results of the pilot project. I know that there was a heated debate on our recommendation to strengthen the link between European Structural and Investment Funds and the European Semester. I understand very well that some of you may think that we are demanding too much but, on the other hand, we all know that challenges in the quality of governance hinder the performance of public investments. So if we manage to ensure a link with the European Semester, which is more proportionate and more operational, I believe it will help foster the essential structural changes in the areas which have been targeted with our pilot actions, such as business environment, innovation ecosystems, vocational education or training.  This also means going towards a structural reform system based on incentives. For the next Multiannual Financial Framework we are reflecting on a mechanism which would provide positive incentives to the Member States. In the meantime, the work continues. The pilot actions tested in some regions, as I said, will be extended this year to other regions of both countries and in other countries. I fully agree with you that we need more cohesion than ever because, as I said, reducing disparities is our main goal. To the idea that you raised, I do not need to underline once again my support for the equal development of all the regions. I fully agree that we are side by side with all the regions. We were with the island of Lesbos, with Madeira, after the earthquake in Italy, so we are with the Solidarity Fund wherever it is needed. You raised a point about EMU and taxes which is not under my responsibility, but I stand ready to come to Parliament every time to provide information on the outcome of the actions we have on the ground everywhere in Europe in all the 290 regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 218, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": " The debate is closed.

And we are witnessing an increase in extreme temperatures, forest fires, droughts, floods and storms, as well as the proliferation of invasive alien species and the loss of biodiversity, and, on the other hand, competition for water and energy demand. Evidence on human responsibility for climate change is beyond doubt and already has devastating environmental effects and high socio-economic costs, especially on the most vulnerable populations. Climate change is also accentuating social disparities throughout our Union. Some social groups are more exposed than others because of poor health, low income, inadequate housing, lack of mobility or gender issues, among other factors. But the entire public is already suffering serious health problems due to pollution, cancers, allergies, premature deaths, etc. A real social drama that also involves tremendous health costs. The money we do not spend on investing to correct the problem is then multiplied in health spending. That is why my report deplores, first of all, the withdrawal of the United States from the Paris Agreement and presents alternatives and responses from the perspective of the role of cities and municipalities in the fight against climate change. The European Union has a lot of work ahead and contributes — it must be said — with 9% of global emissions and its cities generate 75% of them. More than 70% of Europeans and 73% of jobs are found in urban areas. Cities have a great responsibility for global warming and at the same time they are a great potential for solutions. How can it be otherwise, I really want to thank you for the effort by the other MEPs, shadow rapporteurs, reaching a majority consensus among all political groups. There has been a lot of teamwork, in which several experts in this field have participated and in which we have gathered an important social demand: putting on the political agenda the fight against climate change, once again and forcefully. The report can be a real political benchmark on what the role of European regions and cities should be in climate change. I also call on all Members of this House to vote in favour tomorrow and therefore the European Parliament will take an important step on the issue of global warming. It would be a real and definitive step in the fight against warming. We must not forget that the European Parliament represents the voice of citizenship, and in this report it emphasizes the urgency and extreme importance of combating global warming. This requires the European Commission to take up and take up the proposals in this report, although sometimes I, as a Spaniard, have to deeply regret that precisely the Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, Mr Arias Cañete, is known in my country for the measures against renewable energies in our country. You know this well: sun tax, etc. And, if that were not enough, the Government of Spain has been practicing a policy of cuts in competences and economic resources to local authorities for years, unacceptably limiting its capacity to implement measures against global warming. It is time for us to assume the political responsibility entrusted to us by the public. Let's not stay in half inks. Let's take forceful action.

So I think that we can all consider and take to heart the so-called “smart villages” concept, the essence of which, in the middle of the idea, is precisely environmental protection, and techniques that protect our environment in general and enable precision agriculture.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 229, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Maria GRAPINI", "mepid": "124785", "text": "— Madam President, Commissioner, I do not know if this is the way it was meant to be, but the report comes very well after the other report being debated.

When I say important, I mean mostly politically important, because it calls for further mobilisation in the battle against climate change and because it puts some national actors on the front line, of course alongside the Member States. This is, indeed, where regions and cities should be when it comes to finding solutions for climate change mitigation and adaptation. They have proved to be ambitious, forward-looking and innovative, so we need all of them on board. This is why is the Commission welcomes Parliament’s call to national governments to further support climate and energy initiatives at local and national level. It mirrors the efforts made at European level to ensure that low carbon and climate-resilient targets are well embedded in all our policies. As a matter of fact, it seems these efforts have paid off. Climate mainstreaming: the target of at least 20% of the EU budget has helped us to deliver on the Paris Agreement and on our climate and energy objectives. For instance, in the 2014-2020 programming period, close to 25% of the European Structural and Investment Funds will be dedicated to climate-related actions such as energy efficiency, renewables and water retention measures. We take good note of your call for the next Multiannual Financial Framework to be even more ambitious in achieving the objectives of the Paris Agreement. I can assure you, on behalf of the Commission, that we will do our utmost to ensure that projects financed by the EU budget are in line with these objectives. There will be no place for ‘business as usual’. In the meantime, the Commission will continue to support cities and regions through the several ongoing initiatives. I have in mind, for example, the EU Covenant of Mayors, which has been contributing to our climate and energy objectives since 2008. Indeed, EU Covenant cities have already reduced their emissions by 23% and have pledged to reach –27% by the year 2020. I also have in mind the Urban Agenda for the European Union, which was mentioned here by Ms Spyraki and other honourable Members of the European Parliament. As you may know, twelve partnerships have been put in place under the Urban Agenda, including on climate adaptation and energy transition. Here, cities, regions, Member States and the European institutions are currently working together on action plans to improve legislation, increase knowledge and use European funds more effectively in this area. I had the pleasure, for instance, Ms Ward, to meet the mayor of Manchester last week, and I was very impressed by his pro-European approach and by his active enthusiastic work, hand-in-hand, alongside other cities. Congratulations to all the cities. I think it is very important. He was present at another initiative we had last week on regions in transition, and Manchester was selected as one of these industrial transitions. To conclude, I would like to mention that this year is the year of so-called Talanoa Dialogue. This word is from Fiji, describing an inclusive and open exchange, and, in preparation for the next UN Climate Conference (COP24), which will take place in Poland in December, local and regional authorities have this opportunity to share their successful policies and good practices through this Talanoa Dialogue. I encourage all stakeholders to use this platform, and I think it will be a valuable contribution to our collective work.

It’s very ironic to consider that this high—level event on such a crucial issue takes place in Brazil, a country which is shifting to a dictatorship, where land-grabbing and disregard for environmental concerns are widespread. The recent decree putting the military in charge of Rio’s police, fire services and prisons is highly unlikely to solve the city’s security problem. The EU and its Member States must make a much stronger reaction to the increasing state repression. Our governments should support the Alternative Water Forum set to take place next week. This grassroots platform gathers organisations from around the world, including Green Cross, who fight for water to be recognised as a human right, rather than as a commodity. I stand in solidarity with them, and in particular with the indigenous communities in Brazil and elsewhere, who are fighting against corporations trying to seize their lands and their natural resources.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 256, "date": "2018-03-12.json", "name": "Andrejs MAMIKINS", "mepid": "124746", "text": "   – Madam President, there are two pieces of news: good and bad. The good news is that we can see rapid GDP growth in Eastern Europe, and the main reason for this growth is the contribution from EU funds. For example, in my country, Latvia, the Cohesion Fund and other European funds give around 3% GDP growth annually. Every eighth euro in the Latvian state budget is foreign help, as my colleague, the newly-appointed Member of the European Parliament, Mr Mitrofanov, knows very well. The bad news is that the economies of Eastern Europe have become heavily dependent on this money. Let us imagine that this money is not be available for a period after 2020. The reduction of Cohesion Fund spending might coincide with the next cyclical downturn in the world economy. This combination could lead to a very deep crisis in the economies of eastern EU countries.
