This parliamentary committee is the responsible for the treatment of direct demands from citizens, as well as from residents of the Union. As far as we can say, without a doubt, that it is the best thermometer this House has to measure what the real concerns of the population are. Thus, we can see that, although the requests registered last year have been considerably reduced, environmental complaints are always repeated, which reflect how the precautionary principle is continuously being violated, and which deal, in particular, with waste, the management of hydrographic basins and natural parks —as in my own region, in Asturias—, in addition to the controversial extraction through fracking. Also noteworthy are the violations of consumer rights, complaints of discrimination against people with functional diversity, those related to the free movement of people, employment regulation files, animal abuse or the right to vote, such as the so-called \"voting begged ». On the other hand, I would like to recall that the Committee on Petitions is a member of the European Network of Ombudsmen, and that is why we must expand its role as an interlocutor within this Parliament as well. Likewise, it is necessary that, through the intra-parliamentary network, the other committees become more involved. We also call on the Member States to apply Union law correctly. I would like to recall, for example, that during 2015 this Parliament, at the proposal of the Committee on Petitions, had to call the attention of the Spanish Government for the scandalous legislation on mortgage and risk financial instruments, with hundreds of thousands of families affected by evictions, land clauses and preferential ones. Now, without a doubt, it is the European Commission at which the most criticism is directed in this report. The European Commission must ensure respect for the Treaties and Union law, also with regard to the right to petition. Thus, in this report we ask that the European Commission become more involved in the handling of petitions, that it study the cases more carefully, and that the face-to-face responses to the petitioners are not so concise and add additional information. I also ask you, Commissioner, to review the Directive that regulates European citizens' initiatives, which are another fundamental tool for participatory democracy. Procedures should be facilitated and regulatory changes proposed, not as in the case of the initiative on the right to water, which did not obtain any commitment from the Commission, or when the category of citizens' initiative was also denied the campaign of « Stop TTIP ”, with more than three million signatures. Another issue that concerns us is that there is opacity in investigation procedures and infringement procedures. In this report I ask that the information that has to do with open petitions be declassified. I also regret that you, Commissioner, interpret Article 51 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights so strictly on the application of EU law. I believe that sometimes it is necessary to intervene by expanding rights where it is not currently possible. It is the only way to advance in this society. And I give you as an example the cases of patients with hepatitis C or victims of thalidomide. Finally, I would like to remind you that we must reinforce that the right to petition be respected, with a good treatment of petitions and, when necessary, explaining well the reasons for their closure to their petitioners.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2016-12-15.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, on behalf of the Commission I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Vallina, for her interesting and comprehensive report on the work of the Committee on Petitions in 2015. Like its predecessors, the report bears witness to the breadth of issues that petitioners bring to the attention of the Committee on Petitions each year and to the committee’s efforts to ensure that the voices of those petitioners are heard. The Commission agrees that the right to petition has to be a key element for our participatory democracy, in which the right of every citizen to play a direct part in the democratic life of the Union is effectively protected. As my colleague, Frans Timmermans, stated in his last exchange of views with the committee in April, petitions are one of the few instruments where the institutions come into direct contact with citizens. At a time when Europe is facing many challenges, such direct contacts with citizens are more important than ever. The citizens who turn to the committee for help feel in many cases that they have exhausted all other avenues. They are real people with real problems. If we are to have any chance of bridging the gap that seems to have opened up between European institutions and the public, it is crucial that we – and by ‘we’ I mean the Commission and Parliament – can demonstrate that we take citizens’ seriously and show them what solutions exist at European or at national level. As the statistics in the report make clear, the Commission remains the Committee on Petitions’ principal partner when it comes to handling petitions. Of the petitions that are not closed in the early stages of the procedure, nearly 90% are referred to the Commission for an opinion. I am therefore pleased to have this opportunity to reaffirm the Commission’s commitment to providing the Committee on Petitions with meaningful replies to each request for an opinion, and to do so in a timely manner. The Commission also remains committed to sending its most competent officials to the committee’s meetings to ensure that the committee and the petitioners receive the latest information and proper explanations of the issues under discussion. This is perhaps the right moment to turn to one of the issues raised by you, Ms Vallina, in your report, namely the Commission’s interpretation of Article 51 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. I know that this issue has been raised in previous reports and is one where many Members of this House consider that the Commission’s interpretation is unduly narrow. It is clear that the Charter’s scope has its limitations. Defined by the Treaty, they result from the principle of conferral of powers, a cornerstone of the European Union. However, as reflected in the report, the Charter is one element of the architecture of fundamental rights protection in Europe. It complements national systems for fundamental rights protection, but does not replace them. The Commission shares your concerns about how to ensure that citizens’ expectations as regards the protection of their fundamental rights are upheld. The Commission attaches particular importance to increasing individuals’ understanding of how they can avail themselves of their fundamental rights, and whom to approach to enforce them. It is crucial to dispel misunderstandings and avoid raising false expectations. A concrete step in this direction was the introduction last October, in the e-Justice Portal, of a fundamental rights page, which helps individuals seeking to enforce their fundamental rights to identify the competent national non—judicial bodies with a human rights remit. The Commission will also make the best possible use of existing financial programmes to empower civil society organisations and human rights bodies, which work on raising awareness about the Charter and ensuring its application at national level. Let me thank Ms Vallina once again for her report. I look forward to hearing the views of Honourable Members.

That’s certainly good news, but I don’t think that’s the point. The point, though, is that this report reflects a good job, a good teamwork. I have been a Member of the European Parliament and Vice-Chair of the Committee on Petitions for two and a half years. I have seen the state of the petitions two and a half years ago, and I see the current situation. The positive development is very clear, and it is due to a teamwork, a good teamwork, which includes the work of the chair of the committee, the very good professional work of the secretariat, and also the work of the coordinators and political advisers, they are close. meaning they carry these themes on their shoulders. I also welcome the cooperation with the European Commission, I feel that the prestige of the Committee on Petitions is also growing in the eyes of the European Commission, although, in terms of efficiency, there is indeed something that can and should be desired. I also call on the Commissioner and the Commission to pay more attention to the fate of European citizens' initiatives in particular. Most importantly, I feel that we should all be aware that this is a very serious service to European citizens, as we are the only committee that has a direct relationship with them. That is why it is also important that our negotiations take place in a good atmosphere in most cases, and the invited drafters of the petitions see that Members of the European Parliament are interested in their problems and try to help them to the best of their ability.

The subject of the 2015 annual report is an overview of the work of the Committee on Petitions, thanks to which every citizen of the European Union, acting individually or with others, may at any time exercise his right to lodge a complaint with the European Parliament pursuant to Art. 227 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Annual statistics for 2015 show that most petitioners turn to Parliament for help in matters related to the environment, justice, internal market and fundamental rights. Last year, Parliament received more than 1,400 petitions, down by 47% compared to 2014. Unfortunately, the report does not analyze the reasons for this. Of the petitions received, 943 were declared admissible and 483 were inadmissible. The percentage of inadmissible petitions decreased by more than 6% compared to 2014, while the percentage of petitions deemed admissible increased - by almost 6%, which proves that citizens understand our competences better and better. The Committee on Petitions in 2015 also managed to eliminate the existing delays in dealing with petitions. The European Commission is still the largest partner of the Committee on Petitions when it comes to dealing with complaints that have not been closed in the early stages of the procedure and which are almost 90% sent for consideration and opinion to the European Commission. In 2015, the most petitions were sent by Spaniards, followed by Italians, Germans, Romanians and Poles.

It makes sense, since those who judge the committee are at the same time its members who made the decisions. But things are not so rosy. And this is true for handling many reports. Here are some examples of Greek interest: The rapporteur of the European Left in her report does not mention a single word on the issue of war reparations owed by Germany to Greece, an issue that has preoccupied the work of the coordinators and the Committee on Petitions repeatedly. my initiatives. The Committee on Petitions has rejected at least five times my proposals for a public hearing on German compensation. In fact, on 29.11.2016, the committee rejected my amendment no. 172 which referred to this issue. The European Left in this case abstained from voting, supporting in practice the position of the SYRIZA government, which has not only abandoned the fight for German compensation but also where it can undermine it. The rapporteur of the European Left does not mention the important decision of the Committee on Petitions of October 2015, which accepted my suggestion and deemed acceptable the report of the fighters of the National Resistance PEAEA-DSE on the issue of Germany's debts to Greece. This is the first time that Germany has been asked to make a public statement to a European semi-jurisdiction body, such as the Committee on Petitions, on German reparations. However, the SYRIZA-ANEL government in practice undermined our struggle for German reparations and was content to send only one overdue intervention of the Greek Parliament through an MEP. Thus the Committee on Petitions took the opportunity and, with a politically unacceptable decision, rejected the objection I submitted to leave open the report of the National Resistance fighters on the German compensation.This issue and many more make ECR vote against the Committee on Petitions' 2015 action report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 6, "date": "2016-12-15.json", "name": "Cecilia WIKSTRÖM", "mepid": "96677", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, I am convinced that the petitions, and the petitioners that we invite to the committee to have an exchange with them, help us in the long run to better assess the impact that EU legislation has on people’s daily lives and can also help us to find loopholes in the implementation of EU legislation. By acting as a bridge between citizens and the EU institutions, our committee can therefore contribute to both better legislation and helping citizens in their everyday lives. It is therefore crucial that we ensure that petitions are treated seriously and efficiently. In 2015 we agreed on new internal guidelines in the committee and this reform has enabled us to improve the work efficiently and substantially; the backlog of hundreds of untreated petitions that existed in 2014 is now gone. I am extremely proud of that and the committee is up to speed with the treatment of the petitions. As the Chair of the committee I am very happy and proud about this development. I am pleased with the results that we have achieved together and especially the excellent work done by the secretariat during these last years. The backlog that existed before created substantial frustration and disappointment.

In short, citizens are very concerned about the way we treat animals in Europe and that makes sense because it is one of the few values ​​that we still share in Europe. This collective value is expressed in Article 13 of the European Constitution. Animals are beings with consciousness and feeling that we must take full account of. However, the majority of these petitions are dismissed by the Commission with the words “That is not our competence”. How can the Commission be surprised that citizens are turning their backs on Europe? Europe is faltering because you are completely ignoring the concerns of citizens.

I would first underline that petitions are not solely the responsibility of the Committee on Petitions, but should rather be a shared concern of all Parliament’s committees. In this sense we heartily welcome the creation of the petitions network with the involvement of Members from all committees.  The outcome of our work, furthermore, is highly dependent on a fruitful dialogue with the Commission. This is why it is important that this report insists on the need for maximum transparency and prompt feedback by the Commission on the development in EU pilot and infringement procedures. It is also crucial that relevant cases get visibility in the plenary. In this sense, I want to highlight Article 29 of the report which refers to a plenary resolution of 8 October 2015 on mortgage legislation and risky financial instruments in Spain, which the Committee on Petitions brought on its own initiative to the plenary session, as has been reported by Ms Vallina.  Our Group also welcomes the articles that emphasise the role of the fact-finding visit as a specific prerogative of the committee and a fundamental part of this work. A good example of this is the report on the fact-finding visit to the Ebro and Tagus rivers that was adopted this year, and called on the European Commission to revise the Spanish Government hydrological plan. I want to draw attention, particularly to one amendment that our Group tabled, Amendment 15, asking for a change in the Commission’s approach concerning animal welfare with regard to Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

Basically, it can be emphasized that, in the development of the works carried out, the role of listening to the relevant problems that have afflicted citizens has been carried out in a satisfactory manner. However, the mere discussion of the requests submitted in the petition exercise recognized by the treaties cannot represent the only response that the European institutions are able to provide. The credibility of the petition tool and the citizens' conviction about its effectiveness resides predominantly in the ability to concretely put an end to the very serious violations reported, especially if, as we have seen, the complaints involve a plurality of very delicate areas and matters that in fact, they are placed in direct correlation with the overall number of fundamental rights, on which the duty of the European institutions applies to full and unfailing protection. On this question, the existence of glaring shortcomings is evident. The reaction of the European institutions continues to show itself to be weak and late, if not ineffective, despite the content of the petitions revealing an increasingly amplified social and economic unease, with the persistence or aggravation of even highly critical situations. The right to petition therefore remains a crucial tool to allow citizens to continue in the work of denouncing and in the work of democratic control. It is clear, however, that only the political will to guarantee effective protection of fundamental rights, to guarantee full transparency, to guarantee the direct involvement of citizens in decision-making processes, genuinely adopting more warned, it can allow us to believe that the European Union still has a social vocation, endowing itself with a real democratic governance.I am very grateful for Mrs Vallina's work because this report is a truly excellent report and I thank all my colleagues for their cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 10, "date": "2016-12-15.json", "name": "Sotirios ZARIANOPOULOS", "mepid": "125090", "text": "NI). - Madam President, the European Parliament's Committee on Petitions is not an instrument of democratic scrutiny, but an instrument of enforcing the reactionary EU policy, as the report acknowledges, and of manipulating popular protest.

Only one vote of a citizen or president in the form of an e-mail or letter is enough to submit a petition, as the Treaties on the European Union make it possible to address the European Parliament with various problems that citizens encounter in their daily life, provided, however, that the issues raised fall within the scope of the Union's activities European. Each month we examine such petitions in the presence of those submitting them, and this allows us, as parliamentarians, to find out what difficulties exist in implementing EU law in the Member States. That is why we cooperate with the European Commission, the Council, the European Ombudsman, the Legal Service and the authorities of the Member States at various levels. As a committee, we also organize - or we have the right to organize - public hearings and go on observation missions. In the context of the annual activity report of the Committee on Petitions, I would like to highlight a few aspects. First, our priority should be to process petitions within a reasonable time frame to avoid leaving the petition unresolved for too long. Secondly, we should improve the petitions process by digitizing the procedure, making the work of both Members and the committee secretariat easier. And the last point, which is very important, because we must pay attention to the fact that the discussed issues actually concern European law, and not serve as a tool for political struggle. In recent years, political parties during election campaigns have very often tried to use this commission as a tool in the fight for political votes.

It is true that with the Committee on Petitions, with what we are debating today, we have a barometer to find out what citizens are asking for, what citizens need, what citizens are complaining about and how we can build a better Europe. And it is true that it indicates to us in some way that where they put the accent is where we have to intervene. They present petitions on such disparate subjects as the environment, fundamental rights, justice, transportation or the internal market. It is true that in this report we can observe that Spain leads in the origin of petitions, followed by Italy and Germany; And it is true that this Committee on Petitions has been very useful on such important issues as the Marrakesh Treaty - the fact of being able to unblock it - or the unblocking of the Directive against discrimination. It is also true that many requests have been refined. I do not share the opinion of my colleague Auken. I believe that the important thing is to resolve the petitions, but not to give the petitioner false hope, because having an open petition for four, five or six years knowing that we are not competent is to deceive the petitioner. Therefore, it is important that in what we are competent we go upside down, but in what we are not competent we do not give false expectations.

The right to petition is one of the fundamental rights of citizens, enshrined in the Treaty on European Union and in the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Every citizen can turn to the European Parliament to raise a problem with which he or she is confronted in their daily life when this problem is part of the activities of the European Union. The right to petition not only builds citizens' trust in the European Union - petitions are also an important source of knowledge for Members of the European Parliament. Knowledge that allows legislation to be improved. The analysis of the reported problems also allows the identification of difficulties in implementing EU law in the Member States. In order to achieve these goals, citizens' knowledge of the right to petition and the way of submitting them must be widely disseminated, but equally important is the effectiveness of solving reported problems. Therefore, cooperation with national parliaments' petition committees is essential. Unfortunately, not all national parliaments have set up petitions committees. Their absence makes it difficult to submit petitions that do not fall within the scope of the European Union's activities. I am therefore asking the parliamentarians representing these countries to get involved in setting up petitions committees in their national parliaments.

Firstly, I would like to emphasize - thank you to the secretariat - that our work has improved in 2015. We have become more efficient, we have new challenges. I would like to reiterate the main problem in the Committee on Petitions: from my point of view it is simply a matter of defining and determining the competences and responsibilities. To put it in a nutshell: From my point of view it is simply not fair to tell a petitioner after three years: Sorry, we cannot help because we are not responsible. In this sense, it would be better to have bad news quickly than news that comes very late. But this quick message should of course also take into account helping the petitioner find out who is actually responsible for his problem. Second: If we are responsible - this has also been touched on - we have two problem groups. One is the most beautiful: we can help the petitioner. But the second is the long way. We note that the petitioner is in and of itself right with his concerns, we are with him with our hearts, but the legal situation speaks against it, and here the Petitions Committee has an extremely important task to help, if necessary, to change the legal situation. Work with the Commission and with the relevant technical committees must be improved here. We and our famous network are currently working on that. We are also a little bit of a feeler to the citizens when it comes to determining where the laws are not having the same effect as we would like them to.

European citizens are not lawyers, they only see that European law declaratively protects their fundamental rights, but when they turn to the European institutions in specific cases, they point to the authorities of the Member States and say: this is not an EU competence.

Ms Vallina mentioned the situation regarding the European Citizens’ Initiative. The Commission has already implemented important measures to improve the functioning of the European Citizens’ Initiative instrument in several areas, such as the European Citizens’ Initiative register and website, to offer organisers the possibility to use the Commission’s own servers for their own online collection system free of charge, and the improvement of the open-source software for the collection of signatures, and many issues which will be addressed in the future.  Ms Hazekamp raised questions about animal welfare. The Commission receives indeed many petitions on animal welfare, which shows the interest of European Union citizens in this issue. These petitions often refer to Article 13 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, on animal welfare, asking the Commission to act in various areas. You are right: Article 13 obliges the Union and the Member States to pay full regard to the welfare of animals in formulating and implementing certain Union policies. However, it does not itself constitute a legal base for legislative action; therefore actions on animal welfare are only possible if they are at least related to one of the Union policies such as agriculture or the internal market.  We are listening to citizens’ concerns, but it is not within the competence of the Commission to extend its own powers to cover all animal welfare issues. The protection of animals in the EU is subject to detailed rules. The main problems are related to an insufficient level of enforcement and differences in interpretation between Member States. As a consequence, the enforcement of existing rules is a priority for the Commission. The Commission is working with Member States to improve the implementation and the enforcement of rules through various actions. Against this background, I am pleased to confirm that the Commission is preparing to establish a European Union animal welfare platform, which should be operational next year. The platform is indeed to improve animal welfare in the EU, in particular through the strengthening of various stakeholder dialogues.  Mr Terricabras touched on questions regarding EU Pilot cases. It would be premature to disclose information being examined at EU Pilot stage before opening a formal infringement procedure. This is because a possible breach of European Union law has been identified, but not confirmed. The complaint has to be investigated and this involves a dialogue with the Member States via European Union Pilot. No Commission decision has been taken. This work is preparatory work for the Commission services. EU Pilot supports the work of the Commission services to establish the complete factual and legal background of a case. National authorities must be contacted very often in order to clarify facts and the application of rules. The dialogue between the Commission and the Member States concerned is confidential, as confirmed by the Court of Justice. I hope, Members of Parliament, you will agree with me that the number of speakers and the range of issues addressed during this morning’s debate provides proof, if proof were needed, not only of the importance of the right to petition in our Union, but also of the importance of our collective efforts to respond to the concerns that citizens bring to our attention. My choice of the word ‘collective’ in this context is a deliberate one, since both Parliament and the Commission have key roles to play in this area. The Commission very much sees itself as a natural partner of the Committee on Petitions in its work. On behalf of the Commission, I would like to reassure you of our continued and strong commitment to cooperate closely with Parliament in the handling of petitions. We are not trying to find possibilities to look at it from a narrow Commission approach, rather to be partners and to see how to extend our capacities to solve those petitions. Thank you very much indeed for your attention and for your excellent cooperation.

I thank you, Commissioner, and we encourage the Commission to make these changes that you have just announced, because it is necessary to help remove bureaucratic obstacles and administrative obstacles to citizens, in order to offer better access.

Some petitioners turn to Parliament to make proposals for the development of European Union policies, others to appeal against decisions taken by national authorities and to appeal against decisions of national courts. Some citizens complain about gaps in the application of EU law, such as incorrect transposition or non-compliance with European Union rules. The Committee on Petitions has an opportunity and an important role to play in the dialogue with citizens following the recent events in the United Kingdom, as it can bring the institutions closer to EU citizens again.

More recently, we have seen ties between Mongolia and China being strained after the Dalai Lama visited Ulaanbaatar last month. China has responded by closing and disrupting travel at the border between these two countries, in a move that threatens the important economic links that they share. As the direction of US policy towards China becomes increasingly unpredictable, following the election of Donald Trump and his pledge to scrap the Trans-Pacific Partnership, we will see a more assertive stance from the PRC in the region. Such an approach can only be detrimental to Tibet and Xinjiang, where unfortunately Ilham Tohti – who is also in the resolution – is in prison for his advocacy rights for the Uyghur minority, and of course Taiwan.

Here the Chinese authorities have decided to reduce the number of inhabitants by more than half, which amounts to nearly 10 000, and then to begin on major indiscriminate demolition work.  I would also recall here the case of Ilham Tohti, the Uighur university professor sentenced to life imprisonment by the Chinese authorities, who on 11 October was awarded the 2016 Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders. He was also a victim of the tyrannical intransigence of the Chinese Government and he gave voice to the Uighur people, which is a Muslim minority in the Xinjiang region strongly discriminated against by the central government.  It seems that the Government always decides to respond with extreme and unsuitable means when it comes to situations of political dissent. This is highly unacceptable.

The two cases highlighted, the Tibetan Buddhist Academy of Larung Gar and the Uighur intellectual, Ilham Tohti, reveal the continuing failure of the Chinese Government to live up to its international responsibilities for human rights.  The destruction of the Larung Gar Buddhist Academy is an example of the way that China, as an occupying power, engages in attacks on Tibetan religion and culture to try to break the spirit of the Tibetan people. Subjecting former monks and nuns to so-called ‘patriotic education exercises’ is a failure to respect freedom of religion and an unacceptable humiliation. For this year’s Sakharov Prize I was proud to nominate Ilham Tohti, an economics professor and member of the Muslim Uighur minority in western China. Following a flawed legal process where he did not have a proper defence, he is serving a life sentence. We call for his immediate release.  This resolution reminds European governments of their responsibility to address human rights abuses when engaging with the Chinese Government, giving human rights a priority over economic interests – a principle that the British Government has forgotten in recent years.

How interesting that, following his visit there, dictator Ceaușescu introduced the Chinese model to Romania, when his anti-minority homogenization policy sought to break the Hungarians of Transylvania and Szeklerland in the same way that the Chinese communist regime tapped the Tibetans. Nearly three decades have passed since then.

The European Union upholds its one-China policy, while regularly calling upon the Chinese authorities to address the concerns of Tibetans and Uighurs through dialogue. This includes non-use of force, allowing peaceful protest and respecting human rights. The European Union has continued to emphasise to China the importance of fostering dialogue with, and between, different ethnic groups and, in the case of Tibet, of resuming a meaningful dialogue with the Dalai Lama’s representatives.  The demolition of the Larung Gar Buddhist academy and the expulsions and so—called ‘patriotic re-education’ of monastic individuals are a matter of considerable concern to us. According to the Chinese authorities, the demolitions are for health and safety reasons. However, the religious leaders and the monks and nuns concerned were not consulted. The lack of information and dialogue, and the restrictions placed on access to Larung Gar and on the movement of nuns and monks in the area, have been causing much distress in the community and have even prompted suicides. The European Union underlines that, while safety and health concerns may be legitimate, they should not be used as a pretext for repression or forced displacements of religious adherents.  What about Ilham Tohti? Professor Tohti worked peacefully within Chinese law to promote equality and understanding between different ethnic groups. The European Union believes that the charges against him were unwarranted and that the due process of law was not respected during his trial, especially regarding his right to a proper defence. The European Union considers his life sentence for separatism to be completely unjustified. We call for the immediate and unconditional release of both Professor Tohti himself and the students detained in connection with his sentencing.

It is high time for the Government of Myanmar to stop hiding behind excuses to gloss over the unspeakable abuses taking place. They range from the deliberate destruction of property to rape and outright murder. If it wants to be a respected member of the international community, Myanmar must play its part in ending the violence. It must end social discrimination and take steps to ensure that the universal rights of the Rohingya people are fully guaranteed. In addition, international observers must also be given the access needed to monitor living conditions. Ultimately, citizenship must be restored to the Rohingya, giving them access to health care, education, property, marriage rights and jobs.

NGOs speak of the massive destruction of homes, other buildings and even entire villages, causing the Rohingya population to flee once again. 25,000 Rohingya are reported to have arrived in Bangladesh and 30,000 displaced. These events once again highlight the recurring discrimination suffered by the Rohingyas and recall the violence of 2012 and 2015. In his report of June 2016, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights is severe. He rightly denounces the arbitrary deprivation of nationality, threats to their life and security, denials of the most fundamental rights, such as health and education, forced labor, sexual violence and the limitations of their rights. political rights. Since March 2015, the Rohingyas have been deprived of their white card (temporary identity card), and children of a birth certificate since 2012, making them institutionalized stateless people. The coming to power of the National League for Democracy and the appointment of Aung San Suu Kyi, Nobel Peace Prize winner, as special advisor - she could not be appointed Prime Minister due to her marriage to a foreigner -, haven't changed anything. The attitude of neighboring countries is making the situation worse. Bangladesh is increasingly pushing back the Rohingyas, Thailand is instrumentalizing the situation, talking about genocide, while the Rohingyas are just as persecuted there. We remember the mass graves discovered in 2015 in Thailand and, above all, in Malaysia. The establishment of a working commission, under the leadership of Kofi Annan, on development issues in Rakhine State can be a source of hope, provided that this commission can look into violations of rights. of man. It The same goes for the peace talks which are due to take place in February 2017, if the Rohingyas are involved and therefore considered part of the Burmese people. There is an urgent need to set up an independent commission of inquiry into what happened in October 2015. The EU-human rights dialogue must be used to put pressure on the Burmese authorities, to change the law of 1982 on nationality, as well as the so-called protection of races and religions - quite a program - which were adopted in September 2015. The SGP, like the negotiation of the investment agreement, are other instruments available to the EU, as well as dialogue with Burmese parliamentarians. Yes, the situation is difficult. Yes, some progress has been made, but military power remains omnipresent. We cannot be silent.

The European Union has consistently called on the Government of Myanmar to guarantee respect for human rights and pursue durable solutions, including on the status of the Rohingya. The EU Ambassador was part of the first diplomatic mission which, in early November, visited the affected areas after the outbreak of violence. On 20 and 24 November 2016, EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, travelled to Myanmar for the Third EU—Myanmar Human Rights Dialogue. He also met with State Chancellor, Aung San Suu Kyi and the Commander—in—Chief of the Myanmar armed forces.  With these interlocutors, the European Union Special Representative called for the urgent resumption of humanitarian assistance in northern Rakhine State and the setting up of an independent, credible investigation into the 9 October assaults and subsequent operations. He underlined the need for transparency to address allegations of severe human rights violations and emphasised the continuity of initiatives launched by the State Chancellor to tackle the underlying issues in Rakhine State.  With the Commander—in—Chief, Mr Lambrinidis urged a proportionate response to violence, a requirement under international humanitarian law. ECHO Director Androulla Kaminara visited Myanmar during the same period. In her meeting she strongly called for full humanitarian access to northern Rakhine State, where the suspension of activities has deprived some 130 000 vulnerable people of life-saving assistance for over two months now.  On 2 December, the EU issued a statement reiterating the call for the immediate resumption of humanitarian activities in the area. While the formation of an investigation commission is a welcome step, its objectivity remains to be seen. It is equally important that those fleeing violence in Myanmar are not deported or turned back by Bangladesh, but are provided with assistance and protection until the situation in Myanmar allows for their safe return. In response to regional pressure, Myanmar has called for an extraordinary meeting of ASEAN Foreign Ministers on 19 December to discuss Rakhine State. Steadfast EU advocacy has contributed to the resumption of humanitarian activities, albeit limited, and we will continue to reach out to Myanmar. We stand ready to consider further humanitarian assistance for northern Rakhine State, based on the independent needs assessment of our partners. The EU will also continue our human rights cooperation with Myanmar, including in the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Daesh crimes have affected all Iraqis; however, some minorities have been particularly targeted, among them the Yazidi community. We all remember those horrific moments in August 2014 with the shocking exodus of the Yazidi population from Sinjar. Nadia Murad, the United Nations Office for Drugs and Crimes Goodwill Ambassador for the dignity of survivors of human trafficking, together with Lamiya Aji Bashar, winner of the Sakharov Prize 2016, have become the voice for the voiceless victims of human trafficking not just in Iraq, but around the world. We deeply admire their courage and strong determination.  Nadia and Lamiya can count on our full support in fulfilling their tasks as peace builders and as role models for women and girls. In the EU regional strategy for Syria and Iraq as well as the ISIL—Daesh threat of 16 March 2015, we put special emphasis on sexual and gender-based violence. The EU has been at the forefront of calling for the respect of the rule of law and human rights in Iraq, in particular the fundamental rights of minorities. We believe that the preservation of a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional Iraqi society is the only way to put an end to the vicious circle of violence and to promote reconciliation. It is essential to bring people to account for committing atrocities such as those that befell communities in Iraq at the hands of Daesh.  In this regard, the EU is willing to support a global campaign to bring Daesh to justice, as suggested by the UK, Belgium and Iraq, and the idea of the independent investigative commission on Daesh crimes. As we speak, reports are appearing of reprisals and executions carried out against civilians and even humanitarian workers in eastern Aleppo, by forces who claim they are fighting terrorism but are themselves spreading terror among communities they are attacking. We want to underline here that those responsible will be held accountable for their actions. Such war crimes will not be left unrecorded or unpunished and the perpetrators need to be aware of that now.

The reason: There are efforts in the Greek government to pay out a Christmas bonus for the poorest pensioners. We consider this measure to be completely excessive and wrong. (Loud applause) We believe that the Greek people have done immensely in the last few months and, according to the statements and data that we have, the economic conditions of the agreement with the donor countries have been exceeded. Mr President, we would ask you to bring the following request to Mr Schulz: My group would like to see an extraordinary conference of presidents. My group would like to see Mr Dijsselbloem invited there to ask him to justify himself. (Loud applause) My group thinks that he should reverse this decision. But I also ask those who disagree to arrange for this extraordinary Conference of Presidents, because we as the European Parliament have taken on a special responsibility; to accompany the implementation of the treaty with Greece. So let's really clear things up and help us to have such a meeting as soon as possible, if somehow possible, in the next week.

Rule 166 - I have it here - only allows him to sanction a member who seriously disrupts the sitting. Did Mr Voigt seriously disrupt the session? No! So Mr Schulz once again committed an excess of power. Second point of order, Mr President - and I will be very brief - on the basis of Article 141 (4) of our Rules of Procedure, which governs the relations of our institution with the Court of Justice: it is explicitly provided for in this regulation that the President must be authorized by Parliament, by the Legal Committee, before going to court or the Court of Justice. However, what happened is the following: in a dispute between the administration of this Parliament and one of our colleagues, the Parliament was dismissed from its objection of inadmissibility. In a similar dispute, which pits me against the administration of Parliament, the legal experts of Parliament claim that they will appeal. However, so far, at least as far as I know, the rapporteur of the Legal Affairs Committee, Mrs Hautala, has considered this appeal to be unnecessary.

The visa waiver can be withdrawn if a country refuses to take back rejected asylum seekers and economic migrants. However, several elements make us doubt the underlying political agenda.

This is also the case with this objection. The implementing directive, against which the opposition is directed, sought to relax the measures on imports of citrus fruits in connection with the so-called black spots caused by Phyllosticta citricarpa.

comes to taking care of their health.I think this is something that Europe owes them, and I am very pleased that it was raised at the European Parliament and that we will be able to watch the

There is no legitimate reason why the victims should be treated differently across the EU, and that is why they should receive commensurate compensation.  Monetary compensation alone, however, will not be a satisfactory answer. Assistance and support for the surviving victims, including their families, is vital so as to help them with unmet health needs, barriers and the stigma they face day in and day out. Thalidomide survivors have beaten the life expectancy originally set by doctors back in the 70s and 80s. However, they have been faced with deteriorating health and chronic pain as a result of their disability.  Fifty years on, the fight for Thalidomide survivors goes on.

Shortly afterwards, several hundred mothers gathered to give birth to the deformed children. The suspicion that Contergan, which until then had functioned as an \"excellent sedative and sleep-free drug\" without side effects and was therefore popularly used by pregnant women, was confirmed to cause severe developmental disorders of the fetus in the mother's body.

The regulation has contributed to significant progress in sensitive areas, such as pediatric oncology and neonatology, and has also concretely stimulated research in this area. Research has played a fundamental role in filling serious shortcomings in the health sector and has had the merit of identifying and introducing specific and authorized pediatric drugs on the market. However, most drugs currently on the market are not licensed for specific use in children.

It is important to foster innovation in paediatric medicines to ensure that in the future all children can be treated with medicines that have been developed for and proved effective and safe for use for children. However I voted against Amendment 1 because effectively this amendment would mean that the regulators should not oblige companies to complete paediatric studies on medicines that could possibly prove to be ineffective or unsafe. The key change brought forward by the Paediatric Regulation, which I fully support, was to oblige companies to do Paediatric Investigation Plans on all new medicines which they develop, unless a waiver is granted. The 6-month patent or SPC extension is granted to companies who complete those Paediatric Investigation Plans, regardless of whether the new medicine will be authorised for use for children. Amendment 1 effectively challenges the system of a compulsory PIP followed by a reward if the PIP is adequately completed. Companies are reluctant to complete paediatric studies because they mean additional costs for them, so it is absolutely necessary to have compulsory Paediatric Investigation Plans.

The year 2015 was the first full year of the five-year legislative period that began in 2014, and tangible changes have been made to PETI’s work by streamlining the handling of petitions. All this has led to old, forgotten or lost petitions being put on the agenda, the committee deciding on the topics written in them and sending a response to EU citizens. The processing of newly received petitions is no longer hampered by the large number of petitions previously accumulated. The development of an internet portal for the electronic submission of petitions has helped to make EU citizens more aware of the possibilities offered by the right of petition. The good functioning of PETI is an important factor of trust, and EU citizens' faith in the EU institutions depends to a large extent on its work.

Petitions for 2015. The 2015 Annual Report is an overview of the work of the Committee on Petitions. The Committee's program of activities is not linked to the European Commission's legislative program, but is tailored to citizens who, by exercising their right to petition the European Parliament, express concerns about issues in the Union's various political and legislative areas. Statistics for 2015 show that the majority of citizens turn to the European Parliament for help in matters relating to the environment, the judiciary, the internal market and fundamental rights. In 2015, 1431 petitions were received, which is 47% less than in 2014. Spain ranks first in 2015 in the number of petitions filed, followed by Italy and Germany.

It summarises very well the challenges involved in implementing the Union Customs Code (UCC).  As highlighted in the resolution, the customs union is a cornerstone of the European Union and is essential for the proper functioning of the single market. This, in turn, implies a need for efficient customs performance. At the same time, the demands on customs authorities are increasing. In recent years the role of customs authorities has evolved far beyond one of just collecting taxes and duties at borders. Customs now also have a range of other responsibilities linked to protecting society, preventing unfair and illegal trade, and protecting EU citizens and intellectual property rights. They must therefore combine effective controls with means to facilitate and accelerate trade. In this regard, I would like to assure Honourable Members of the Commission’s intention to uphold the Union’s strict compliance with its commitments under the WTO Trade Facilitation Agreement. The UCC is designed with this in mind. The aim is a customs environment that combines the facilitation of trade with a safe and secure supply chain, while also managing new challenges such as evolving business practices. The resolution notes that changes are already planned to the legal provisions contained in the UCC package. Updates cannot be avoided when dealing with a complex and comprehensive package of legal texts. However, throughout our discussions and work on amendments we involve the Trade Contact Group as well as Member States and Parliament so that all stakeholders can assess the implications of planned changes. I should add that many of the ongoing and planned corrections and improvements are being made as a result of proposals by trade. I also note your call for a clear, coherent and ambitious customs strategy. I would like to inform you that we have been working with Member States on a governments’ communication that should be adopted at that end of this year. This communication will address the need for a strengthened partnership between Member States and the Commission in managing the customs union.  Turning to IT systems, the Commission has been working proactively with Member States for several years to streamline and harmonise the process of full automation of customs. The aim is that Member States will implement the relevant IT systems in a common and integrated way in their national IT environments. The resources available at national and EU level are under severe pressure. The Commission will address the question of the funding of customs equipment, including IT, in the impact assessment we will carry out to prepare the next generation of customs programmes in the context of the next Multiannual Financial Framework. The Commission’s work will also address the cofinancing of national and EU projects as well as the connection of IT systems in different EU domains.  The resolution mentions the need for greater risk management and controls. I would like to draw Parliament’s attention to the Commission strategy and action plan for customs risk management of 2014. Among other objectives, the action plan aims to improve the quality of advance information submitted by traders and improve inter-agency cooperation. A progress report on the action plan of July this year noted that there have been some positive results in inter-agency cooperation, in particular in the area of health and safety. However, cooperation between customs and law enforcement and security agencies is less advanced. So the implementation of the risk management strategy remains a challenge for the years to come. However, I am pleased to note the Council’s full support, in its conclusions of 6 December, for continuing work along the lines of the strategy. Customs is now also a recognised partner in our efforts to construct a security union. Turning to e-commerce, the Commission agrees that trade from e-commerce must be facilitated. At the same time, we must protect revenues, safety, security and intellectual property rights and ensure a level playing field between EU and non—EU traders. The Commission is working with Member States and traders in several fora, including the World Customs Organisation, to reach balanced e-commerce solutions. In conclusion, it is clear that the full benefits of the UCC will become evident only after full implementation. However, I would like to confirm that we are considering some form of status review of the UCC that would explain where we are with implementing IT systems and the remaining legal issues. A fully—fledged fitness check or independent impact assessment would only make sense, as the motion for a resolution notes, once all IT systems have been implemented. I look forward to hearing your views.

First of all, I wish you a very Merry Christmas. But the joyful wish cannot hide the fact that in the area of ​​customs policy we urgently want to draw the European Commission's attention to three key issues with this resolution. The first question of these three key questions is as follows: Does the European Commission really have a concept based on the modernized Customs Code, which was introduced to the European Parliament in 2005, then failed and was renewed in 2013 and is now being continued with the Union Customs Code? Does the European Commission really have a comprehensive plan to put this customs code into practice in all 28 - then possibly 27 - Member States by 2019? Does it understand that customs duties vary greatly in the Member States of the European Union? Some states have no significant customs revenue at all, but still have a customs administration that they would hardly need as a result. Other countries have a very high customs volume, and with globalization, of course, effective, fast, flexible, but harmoniously uniform customs processing is becoming increasingly important, and we need the Member States by our side. I would be very happy if the commission presented a very convincing concept, which is also backed up with impcast assessments, in this area. The second point that you raised, Commissioner, is the question: How do we manage to adapt customs law to the digital age in a global world in such a way that we have security for consumers on the one hand, but also at the same time Encourage trustworthy bodies in the Member States and in business to work together so that the goal is achieved, that the customs revenue that must be generated, the customs duties that are paid have to become effective in the end? What options do we have there to provide traders and economic operators with simple, flexible, fast and inexpensive systems through a uniform electronic customs system so that they can ultimately manage this process in the way that citizens, consumers and buyers want? From my point of view, this is a very central challenge because, of course, different policy areas also overlap here. The value added tax system is one thing, effective and unbureaucratic customs clearance is another. The whole thing will only succeed if the digital settlement systems of the member states are so closely networked that it actually works in the end. At the moment we simply have to realize that every country is trying to push back the date of introduction of such a system on their own so far that in the end the European Union should pay for the fun. That is why I ask the European Commission to prepare itself in good time so that the member states have actually set up these systems so that we can really implement this uniform customs policy here together with the market participants. At that point, Mr President, I will leave my first appeal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 837, "date": "2016-12-15.json", "name": "Tibor SZANYI", "mepid": "124703", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Group. - President! Dear European Parliament! The S-D Group also considers it essential that the European Customs Union, as one of the cornerstones of the Union, function properly and effectively and in the best possible way for the benefit of European businesses and citizens. Hopefully, the new Customs Code, introduced in May 2016 and fully implemented in December 2020, will indeed lead to greater legal certainty, uniformity and simpler customs rules in practice. This would be of particular interest to small and medium-sized enterprises, which are particularly disadvantaged by complex customs rules and procedures, so that they also have to bear additional tax burdens due to tax evasion and tax fraud by multinational companies. If there is no positive change for small and medium-sized enterprises in these areas, the competitiveness of the European Union will be significantly felt. In addition to small and medium-sized enterprises, the other priority group whose interests must be served by the new Customs Code is European consumers. The new customs legislation must therefore better protect consumers from goods that are harmful to health and the environment, and from illegal goods. In order for the new rules to truly lead to a simpler, faster and more secure customs union, we urge that the problems that arise during the transitional period be constantly monitored and that the system be adapted so that from 2021 all Member States meet the required requirements.

The EU customs policy is a great challenge for the entire Commission and the European Union. On the one hand, a good customs policy is to fight mainly against illegal trade, organized crime, fraud and terrorism, while at the same time facilitating legal trade and providing citizens and businesses with a sense of security. The current resolution aims to facilitate, simplify, make the EU customs policy coherent and fair, while at the same time making customs duties effective and uniformly enforced. The point is that in the delegated acts to the Customs Code, the European Commission proposes only proportionate provisions that are designed to facilitate legitimate trade and develop European competitiveness on a global scale, and not constitute additional administrative barriers. Here are two examples of creating such barriers. Requirements for financial guarantees in the case of the so-called AEO authorized entrepreneurs who already comply with strict rules - according to many companies, these requirements should be waived. Further, simplified customs procedures for low value shipments for import and export should be maintained. On the other hand, the European Commission proposes to withdraw from the already existing customs simplifications. This runs counter to the objectives of the Digital Single Market to enable consumers and businesses to have better access to goods and services. Therefore, the ECR group supports the text of the resolution, which is intended to motivate the European Commission to intensify dialogue with the business community and to jointly create a modern, coordinated, transparent, fair, consistent, predictable and safe EU Customs Code for citizens and companies.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 839, "date": "2016-12-15.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Club. - Mr. President, we know how it was.

Of course, we want these procedures to be carried out with as little bureaucracy as possible, in short, completely paperless operations, simplification of certain conditions for issuing permits, with the need to ensure adequate control over these areas, because paperless operations also support opportunities for abuse.

Unfortunately this is not the case, customs clearance practices vary from state to state and if we talk about sanctions we find absurdities, ranging from the payment of simple arrears to even criminal consequences in some states.

This ideology has been rejected by many peoples and by the citizens of the world's largest economy, the United States. With Donald Trump, trade is for national development and the protection of industry. Tariffs are necessary to balance trade in the spirit of the Havana Charter for Peace in Commerce. Your Union customs code starts from a premise: the general disappearance of these duties to lead to trade facilitation. We therefore need a continuous decrease in the control rate. In this age of protectionism and tariff rearmament, the European Union is still one step behind. In addition to a new contribution from the Commission to the liquidation of our sovereign States, by strengthening the freedom for importers to clear customs wherever they want, in particular with centralized customs clearance, you encourage them to shop among customs administrations to seek the most lax. and the less observant. You also weaken our States and make them insecure.

I would probably have to repeat myself in many ways with my predecessors, but I will mention one of the things that was not mentioned here. When the modernization of the customs union was launched in 2003 in order to establish a paperless environment, it was important that everything went fast. Perhaps, let's say, as quickly as possible so that the European Union can come to terms with the rest of the world. That is why I was pleased to read in several documents that 98% of customs declarations lodged in the European Union are already in electronic form. But, Commissioner, we live in the twenty-first century. Is 98% really a lot or a little? At a time when we are facing increasing globalization of trade and global crime or terrorism, is this number really enough? The Customs 2020 program, together with the new Customs Code, are certainly logical, correct steps in continuing to modernize the entire customs union, which exchanges information in real time. As the rapporteur has already mentioned here, it is very important that this modernization takes place in the same way across all the countries of the European Union. We need to have an overview of all goods that cross the borders of the European Union, and in the current digital age we can only have that if everything is recorded electronically and states then exchange information effectively. I therefore fully support the efforts of the European Commission and most Member States to electronicize communication between customs offices and to replace old technologies with new, reliable and, above all, secure ones.

Many of the customs controls derive from European legislation. I would therefore like the Commission to investigate this phenomenon in depth because, in addition to being dangerous for citizens, it distorts the internal market and penalizes those who, like in my country, do their job well. Everyone needs to apply the law in the same way because with the free movement of goods once a product has entered Europe it can end up in any country, without further checks, and knowing this situation there are those who take advantage of it. Attention, it is not a question of individuals, but of entire administrations, entire states, entire governments that try to attract international trade flows by turning a blind eye.

But we must not forget how the customs union started and so did the Common Agricultural Policy, because they are mechanisms for the protection of the European Union itself, for the protection of the economy, that is why there is a customs union. Now we have reached the other end. In fact, there is no customs union! Customs duties with almost all countries have been abolished. Minimum customs duties are levied. We import duty-free oil from Tunisia, we have duty-free imports from Ukraine. So, what is needed in the first phase is to return to the real situation, that is, to a phase of protection of the European economy, by strengthening mainly the tariffs. This is the trend that is being seen in the United States by Mr. Trump. At the same time, the frauds that are taking place must stop, because there is an increase in customs policy, especially in the ports. In conclusion, Mr President, since I appear to be the last speaker, I would like to wish you, the Commissioner, colleagues a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year in 2017, as well as the interpreters. who have remained with us until this time.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 850, "date": "2016-12-15.json", "name": "Vytenis Povilas Andriukaitis", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank all of the honourable Members for their comments and for the importance they attach to the implementation of the Union Customs Code. I believe that our two institutions share the same objective of wishing to modernise customs for the benefit of both trade and administrators. I would like to address some of the points made in the debate. It is certainly true that further work is needed, particularly with regard to new trade simplifications, such as centralised clearance, which depend on EU wide IT systems. However, I would like to underline that the Commission is committed to continue working in these areas, in close collaboration with Member States and trade representatives. You commented on the fact that the UCC was not the subject of an impact assessment. In fact, this was deemed unnecessary because a detailed impact assessment had already been carried out on the modernised customs code.  Turning to e-commerce: I would like to stress that the simplifications that existed before the UCC for express carriers importing low-value goods continue to exist during the UCC transitional period.  Finally, I would like to confirm the Commission’s commitment to continue to cooperate closely with Parliament so as to ensure that the EU customs policies indeed are effective, proportionate and fit for purpose.  I wish you all a Happy New Year and merry Christmas, and I thank you for this excellent debate today.

This is not possible if Member States do not respect this Code or allow it to be updated to the changing situation on the ground. We need to simplify the complex customs rules and procedures which are particularly detrimental to our SMEs. We need to complete the digitalisation of custom controls well before the end of the transitional period to do so. For all this, we need action from the Council and better controls by the Member States and the Commission.  This is an area that is in theory already harmonised. I simply do not understand why we do not enforce it as such. Our borders are only as strong as their weakest point. If a trader can cheat by going to Member State A instead of Member State B, he will. If a trader knows he will get a smaller fine if he is caught in Member State A instead of Member State B, he will go there.
