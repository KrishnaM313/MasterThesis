Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. Today is the first time that we have discussed concrete legislation following the LuxLeaks affair. That is why I think it is a very important debate, because it is a question of us as a Parliament sending out a clear signal here, for clarity, for transparency, for fair tax competition in the European Union. In the area of tax rulings in particular, the Member States are already obliged to exchange information, but it has not yet worked – to put it bluntly. At the beginning of this debate, I would like to express my thanks to the Commission, in particular the Commissioner for Competition, for addressing the issue of fair tax competition, also from the point of view of state aid. Because in the end it's nothing else. That is why it must be taken up here. The Commission has put forward a proposal to make all tax assessments of cross-border importance available to Member States in an automatic procedure. I believe that this Commission proposal is a first good approach. However, we in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs have also made a clear support for including a large number of measures. I would just like to mention a few key words: scope. We have argued that all valid tax rulings, in so far as they do not concern natural persons, i.e. legal persons, should be included in this procedure within the scope of application. So all tax rulings for legal persons, a significant extension! We have argued that the information should be exchanged immediately, not every three months, as the Commission has proposed. We have also called for additional information to be included here: a tax identification number, different tax rates, information where deviations from normal tax law are applied, and so on. We have expressly stated that the Commission can also apply this information in the context of competition law. We believe that this is a very important point, because only in this way will we be able to exert pressure to ensure that tax law is not applied here against the Member States or against neighbouring states, but that everyone is aware that they must also deal with the rules on competition and aid when they issue a corresponding tax ruling. I am disappointed – and I want to make this very clear – that on 6 October the Council agreed on a proposal that falls well short of what the Commission has proposed. In fact, only cross-border tax rulings and transfer pricing agreements are to be named here – without knowing exactly what that means. The Council remains unclear. The entry into force is to be postponed for another year. effect over five years – not, as we say, all valid tax rulings. That is why I am disappointed. I want to make it very clear that the finance ministers of the Member States have not fulfilled the promise that has been made here in Parliament, which has been repeatedly made in the Special Committee, but also in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, that they want to make a contribution to clarity and transparency here. That is why I urge the Member States to enter into serious negotiations with the European Parliament here in order to achieve the best possible results, namely that we arrive at a clear, transparent European model in the area of tax rulings and tax price agreements, which does not make tax law at the expense of the neighbour, but ensures that everyone is taxed according to its capacity where there is added value.

Later today, in the TAXE Special Committee, which was set up after the Luxleaks scandal, we will also vote on another report and hope that the spirit of compromise will also prevail. In fact, it has been a year since the Luxleaks scandal and the problem of exchanging information is just one of those that needs to be dealt with urgently and seriously, through a compromise, not only within Parliament but also in the form of an interinstitutional agreement, including the Commission and also the Council, in order to introduce , in European culture, a new way of addressing taxation. It is in this sense that I would like to begin by greeting the Commission on the number of initiatives that have already brought to light, and to ask the European Commission not to give up this fight.  It is essential to have a strong position in this Parliament, which we are building. The strong position of the European Commission is indispensable. But there must also be a credible position on the part of the Council. In this regard, I also endorse what my colleague Mr Ferber has just said about the disappointment of the ECOFIN Council's decisions of 6 October, not only with regard to the date of entry into force of the new procedures, but in particular at 3 other levels. Firstly, it is unacceptable that the agreement to exchange information on so far secret agreements, which favour multinationals in the field of taxation, should allow them to be adopted and exchanged between Member States, without giving the European Commission the role it has to play. The European Commission must be the platform on which this exchange of information takes place, so as to prevent what has been the scarcity of all the compromises between states that have existed so far remains the European standard. The European Commission must be the exchange platform. Secondly, it is unacceptable that governments have limited this exchange of information to the rulings granted in the last 5 years, when the European Commission's proposal was 10 years old, with numerous agreements still in place and therefore having to be made accessible to tax administrations, whatever the period in which they began or at least , that all those that are still in force are the subject of this exchange of information. Finally, I would also like to mention the fact that all the rulings, all these exchanges, all these agreements, have to be transmitted, because, in the internal market, the advantages that are attributed in a single Member State to a multinational automatically have an impact on the tax base in all other States. It therefore makes no sense to limit the obligation to exchange information to exchanges between States, when, in fact, the agreement ultimately creates, in the internal market with free movement of capital, a risk of tax loss for all other States.  In short, there is a new European agenda on this. Parliament is working in good faith. The Commission is working intensively, and we want it to continue. But the Council must act with fairness, with determination, in order to correct the situation of fiscal injustice in Europe and restore the confidence of Europeans, citizens, who are those who pay taxes, in tax matters, in the seriousness of the work of the integrated project in which we all believe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 26, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "Molly SCOTT CATO", "mepid": "124942", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, the Green Group believes that we are in a tax crisis. We see governments – not just of remote tropical islands, but within our very own Union – agreeing bargain deals with multinational corporations. Our citizens pay the price for this: seeing the public sector starved of investment and our SMEs losing out because they simply cannot compete with the low rates of tax that multinationals can arrange for themselves. Taxation and, more importantly, tax justice is of the utmost importance for European citizens. As we approach the anniversary of the Luxleaks scandal, I wish to focus on a key issue of this debate: the question of who should know what about tax. So how much do we know? The answer is that we know a lot less than we need to in order to be able to develop policies that reassure our citizens that corporations are paying the taxes they should. As an elected representative and member of the TAXE Committee, there are still a great many vital documents that I do not have access to. Last November, people across Europe were horrified to find out that the Commission President himself had been the architect of a secret system of sweetheart tax deals for some of the world’s most powerful corporations. Yet, without the actions of the brave whistleblower, Antoine Deltour, they would have known nothing about this. So how can it be right that it is Deltour who is facing legal action whereas the architects of the dodgy tax deals do not face redress? Very few of the people I represent think that Deltour is the guilty party on the issue of tax avoidance. The first real sign that the Commission means business came last week with the announcement of the results of the inquiries into the tax affairs of Starbucks and Fiat and the demand for tax to be recovered. Such inquiries still have a long way to go and, while I congratulate Commissioner Vestager on her activities so far, I would encourage her to widen and deepen her investigation. In March this year the Commission presented a tax transparency package, which included the files that we are focussing on today. They proposed the repeal of the 2003 Savings Tax Directive, which provided tax authorities with the information they needed to ensure tax was not avoided, but has now been superseded by a new directive that has wider scope. I was the rapporteur on this repeal and I undertook a thorough investigation of the risk that it might open up loopholes to facilitate further tax avoidance. I had excellent support from my shadows, and we agreed jointly that we would support the repeal. The Directive on Administrative Cooperation is now being extended to call for automatic exchange of information on tax rulings. So important was this piece of the package that the Council, in a break with tradition, proceeded without hearing Parliament’s position. This is extremely disappointing, as we have made some significant improvements on the Commission proposal, notably extending the scope of tax rulings considered. However, returning to my central point, we do not believe Parliament has been ambitious enough on how information will be made available. As Greens we call for the Commission’s central directory of rulings to be made public not only to the Commission and other Member States, but for European citizens as well. This call for public information will be reintroduced as an amendment before plenary, as we believe it is what the people of Europe wish to see. As I said at the start of my speech, the central issue of the Luxleaks scandal was the lack of public information. Senior politicians, tax accountants and corporate bosses knew exactly what was going on in the cosy world of what they call tax rulings, but as a parliamentarian I knew nothing, and those I represent knew nothing. It is for this reason that the Greens in Parliament will settle for nothing less than full publication of tax information. It is only when politicians know that their deals with corporations may become known to their electors that they will act in the interest of those electors, and it is only when corporate lawyers consider the reputational damage that might follow shady tax deals that they will stop spending so much time devising these elaborate webs of tax avoidance.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen of the rapporteurs, aggressive tax planning has become a major concern within the Union and at the global level, particularly in the context of the work of the OECD and the G20.  Increasing transparency in tax rulings between Member States' tax authorities is an important step - I would say major - to combat this aggressive tax planning and tax evasion. Indeed, the decisions taken by the Commission last week in the case of Fiat in Luxembourg and Starbucks in the Netherlands are in line with this. My cooperation with Ms. Vestager and her services is excellent.  Member States now have room for discretion in deciding whether a tax anticipation decision can be relevant in another EU country, known as on-demand information exchange. However, this lack of transparency on tax rulings is being exploited by some companies in order to artificially reduce their tax contributions! This has become simply intolerable for our fellow citizens who have been called upon to make a strong contribution to solving deficits during the crisis and who have civic behaviour. That is why we presented an ambitious proposal in March 2015 to introduce an automatic exchange of information on tax rulings between all Member States. I would like to thank Mr Ferber for the quality of his report on this proposal. We have always had fruitful exchanges on this subject. On 6 October, the Member States reached a compromise, a political agreement which I think is quite appropriate, given that we had the publication of the OECD BEPS recommendations the day before, which were then adopted by the G20 in Lima as part of the IMF meetings. I agree with Mr Lamassoure, who is still chairing the special committee TAXE: Parliament's work in this area has put - and I want to thank you on all the benches - a decisive pressure on the Member States to reach an agreement. Parliament was not around the TABLE of the ECOFIN Council, but the spirit of Parliament weighed on its decisions. This political agreement, which we must take for what it is, is a strong and strong signal from the European Union: it has enabled us to present, in Lima, a common and ambitious front of the European Union for greater fiscal transparency, and I was able to encourage, at the G20 meeting, our partners to do the same and turn this European initiative into a global or global standard.  Mr Ferber expressed a disappointment, somewhat mitigated by Mrs Ferreira, and I would like to respond to that. Of course, you have raised three points: first, the desire to go beyond cross-border tax rulings to include all tax rulings, then a regret that the period of retroactivity was not longer and finally, a nuance on the fact that we could have gone faster in the implementation of this text. To tell you the truth, the Commission does not disagree with you, Mr rapporteur. It is true that the Commission's original proposal went further than what was adopted by the Council, but ladies and gentlemen, you know how the Council works. The procedure is very complicated, we must be able to adopt the tax decisions unanimously and, in this case, we have done so not only unanimously but very quickly, since it took seven months between the tabling of the Commission's proposal and the adoption of this text by the ECOFIN Council, and the Commission has agreed to this compromise.  What for? Because our feeling is that the main principles of our proposal are maintained in this text, including the automatic exchange of tax rulings, including the wide scope covered, including the exchange of information between all Member States, including the Commission's involvement - and this could have been discussed at some point. There is a good dose of retroactivity, ten years would have been better for me than five, but five - forgive me this lapalissade as they say in French - were better than the three years we were offered for a while and which would have started to be problematic. Finally, there is the implementation timetable. I had hoped that the text could come into force as early as the end of the first quarter of 2016, but the States have argued - which is not entirely false, honestly - the deadlines for transposing and voting such texts. In the end, I would say that this is a reasonably ambitious compromise that does not lead - it was essential for me and the Commission, and I can assure you that we would not have consented to anything else - to distort our proposal; it is a good quality compromise, which marks a very significant step.  I would like to stress that the Commission's involvement has been maintained in the compromise text. This is good news, I think, for the Commission, but also for the general interest and for the European Parliament, because this involvement is essential to monitoring the functioning of the directive, it increases the credibility of the member states' commitment, and it is fully supported, I know by you, the European Parliament, and I wanted to thank you for that. If we had remained in a pure exchange between Member States, without the Commission's involvement, the risk - how to say - that the administrations between them would not work in collusion but sometimes with some accommodations could not have been completely ruled out. Let me tell you a few words about the other two reports that are being discussed today. Firstly, the agreement signed on 27 May between the European Union and Switzerland on the automatic exchange of financial information is a historic agreement which marks - and I believe that for our fellow citizens, it is symbolically extremely strong - the end of Swiss banking secrecy for THE residents of the Union. This is a major step in the fight against tax evasion, in line with the objective of ensuring fairer taxation for our citizens. I am pleased that this analysis is shared by the rapporteur, Mr Kofod, in his draft resolution in favour of the conclusion of the agreement and, of course, I urge this House, your Parliament, to follow the opinion of the Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs and to fully support this initiative.  We have also proposed the repeal of the provisions of the Savings Tax Directive, as a result of the entry into force, from next January, of the measures adopted at the end of 2014 on the automatic exchange of financial data. I have some experience in this field, having been minister of finance in a not-so-distant past life. It is regrettable in the first place that the Directive on the taxation of savings was adopted so late, so much so that it fell into obsolescence immediately after its adoption. This must be a lesson for us on the fact that we must move quickly and decisively in this area, but it turns out that the new standard exceeds what the Savings Tax Directive could bring and, therefore, I welcome Mrs Scott Cato's report, which I thank, which calls for the withdrawal of this directive. I allow myself, and she will understand this, to make a small point: I think that the way you have spoken of the President of the Commission, Jean-Claude Juncker, is a bit expeditious and I will defer to what the TAXE committee will say, which, I recall, has heard the President who has come before her. I think it is, when we talk about the head of such an important institution, words that we must be able to master and adjust.  The Commission will report, in the report to the Council and Parliament, on the effectiveness of the measures it is required to present on the operation of automatic exchange of information on the basis of the obligations established by the Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the Tax Field. In the meantime, the Commission will take advantage of the opportunities provided by the structured dialogue with Parliament and its Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs to inform the members of your institution without delay of any significant development. In summary, I think we are now debating what is a major and innovative approach. I call it the transparency revolution: on the one hand there is public pressure, on the other hand the evolution of technology and the media, but also the role of your Parliament, the will of the Commission, and the fact that the Member States also feel committed to action. I am convinced that with our joint action - and we thank the rapporteurs and the various parliamentarians once again - this revolution of transparency will not stop.  I would add that the political will of the Commission, and mine in particular, is, during the five-year term of this Commission's mandate, to continue to move forward resolutely. I am also thinking of the principle of effective taxation, which is that the profits of companies, especially multinationals, are taxed where they are created, I am thinking of reviving the ACCIS/CCTB project, which is important for both transparency and economic efficiency. Finally, I am thinking of the question of the publication of country-by-country information, on which the Commission is moving forward and on I also had the opportunity to express my will. This is indeed a revolution of transparency and today we are recording a stage, but it is not, for us, the end of this fight.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 30, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "Andreas SCHWAB", "mepid": "28223", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has The subject of the debate today is not only about the report by Mr Ferber, whom I would like to congratulate most warmly on his successful work on this important dossier, but also about the automatic exchange of information with third countries on financial accounts as a whole in the European Union. This is an incredibly complex issue on which we must be careful not to lose sight of the basic logic of cooperation in the European Union, the fundamental logic of the European internal market. For many, the details of the legislation we are talking about here are not really crucial, but it is crucial that the European internal market remains the home market that we promised them years ago for workers and for businesses. And here I think we must be careful, Commissioner, that with the example you have just mentioned, so-called country-by-country reporting, we are not now falling back into the logic of before 1993 and forcing companies to take the individual member's rules more seriously than the European whole. However, I would, of course, deny that the events relating to the Luxleaks affair have called for rapid and decisive action, and that Mr Ferber's report is therefore absolutely in the right direction, namely to speed up the cross-border exchange of tax rulings. In my view, however, it remains to be seen whether we can actually leave the cross-border significance of such rulings to the assessment of the Member States, or whether it does not create a path of incursion that will bring this whole system out of balance. That is why, Commissioner, I would like to urge you to continue and continue this process, which began with the Gibraltar ruling of the European Court of Justice. We are not at the end of this.

Madam President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. For me, last week's decision against Starbucks and Fiat is no less than a turning point. Because so far we have heard from so many that the behaviour of the past may have been illegitimate, but not illegal. With last week's decision, the European Commission made it clear that we are dealing here with illegal action by states together with companies. If the Member States are serious now with their outwardly so widely postulated request to get changes into the tax rulings, more transparency, fair tax competition, then one wonders if the European Commission is not fully involved in the automatic exchange of information at this point.  The Commission has been so successful in that state aid procedure because, as guardian of the Treaties, it has been able to act directly on competition law. If the Member States now prevent the Commission from being fully informed, then they deliberately do not want to sharpen this sword any further. They have to ask themselves why?  The same applies to the question: to what extent will the tax rulings be exchanged retroactively? If you look at the now well-known, even decided procedures, when the tax rulings come from – yes, these are periods that go back further than the five years whose tax rulings are now to be exchanged. One wonders: is the purpose of this short period perhaps only that more light should not come into the dark? We in Parliament must not let up on this, because we support the Commission at this point in terms of a full exchange of information, a demand for full information – including on past rulings.

If we all want to pay lower taxes, we must also ensure that everyone pays their fair share. We are debating three dossiers today. Two of them are good, technical dossiers with which we adapt our regulations to international standards and eliminate unnecessary legislation. That is a good thing. We are also discussing a third dossier, namely that of the automatic sharing of information about tax rulings. I do have some questions about that. I was very pleased with the European Commission's proposal. Transparency and information sharing is crucial in this area. That is also why our Finance Minister, Johan Van Overtveldt, will actually start passing on this information to other EU Member States from 1 January. But after that, the European Commission's dossier went to the European Parliament, and I think something may have gone wrong there. In a number of amendments, Parliament seems to opt for more bureaucracy and logger procedures. I don't think we need that. If we want to tackle tax fraud seriously, we will also have to focus, then we must choose where to use our resources in the most efficient and most effective way. This is the same as parliament's amendments.

The tax competition and the laws of elimination of so-called double taxation generate a race to the fund that will only end when the taxation of capital income is equal to zero. The legislation we are discussing here today does not solve this, but at least it can lead to minimum conditions of loyalty between Member States and help governments and citizens become aware of the scale and severity of this phenomenon. Ensuring the automatic exchange of information between tax authorities is of the most elementary justice, that is Mr Ferber's proposal. The tax abuse of multinationals results in a loss of tax or tax income, estimated at 50,000 to 70 billion euros. If we also count on other issues, such as the amount relating to tax avoidance and special agreements, this amount could reach one hundred and sixty thousand, eur 190 billion. This fraud results in an burden of the tax levied on other national economic agents, in particular workers, in the non-fulfilment of civic and social responsibility on the part of businesses, while depriving sovereign states of key resources to comply with their social policies, combat poverty and social inequality and promote economic development.

In total, however, there were more than 350 tax rulings, tax arrangements and companies which have concluded special agreements with the Luxembourg tax authorities. Many of these companies have paid less than 1 percent tax. This has led to huge tax losses across Europe. The question has arisen today: how high were these failures? There is a study carried out on behalf of the European Parliament, which assumes that up to EUR 190 billion is lost every year in the European Union through profit shifting, special tax arrangements, inefficient tax collection and similar practices. But there is also a similar analysis by the Monetary Fund, which says that it is five per cent of annual corporation tax income that we lose. The OECD shows how unfair this system is. Namely, that multinationals have a strategy of paying only 5% on average, while small medium-sized enterprises pay an average of 30%, while cross-border enterprises pay on average 30% less köSt than exclusively national enterprises. Today's report by Markus Ferber is particularly important because it is the first concrete step towards an automatic exchange of information in the field of taxation. The first concrete step is that tax rulings and transfer pricing agreements need to be exchanged, that there is more transparency in the area of taxation and that there is tax competition and fairness. But that is not enough. There must be more action, as well as country by country reporting, the fair taxpayer seal of approval, the common corporate tax base for entrepreneurs operating in the various Member States.

Tax systems must be simple, stable, safe predictable. They are part of a stimulating environment for entrepreneurs and this is our constant message. Contributing to a simpler system is the abolition of the Savings Interest Income Tax Directive.  This Directive was the basis for establishing the exchange of information on savings interest paid by payers based in one Member State to natural persons resident in another Member State. It is very important from the point of view of transparency and fairness of the tax system, and this is a common goal for all of us. In the meantime, there has been a lot of work to be done to cooperate with Member States and to exchange tax information in order to monitor all financial flows and tax avoidance.  The Directive on Administrative Cooperation in the field of taxation, which created a legislative framework for the application of OECD global standards in the field of automatic data exchange in terms of taxation, has a greater scope than the Savings Interest Income Taxation Directive and that is why we supported its abolition.

So we now know that it's not just immoral, it's also illegal. And very clearly, if this text had been voted on in 2011 or 2012, everything in the text that we are going to vote on soon would not have allowed these tax diversions. And so, clearly, this case shows us that the European Council has not yet understood the importance of the issue. I really think that Parliament's text is much more ambitious than this decision of 6 October, and I would like to thank and congratulate our colleague Markus Ferber and all the shadow rapporteurs. This is obviously a compromise text, and I would like to highlight a few important points.  The first, as has been said, is obviously the scope. All the tax rulings of multinationals, without exception, must be analysed, whether national or international, and without a time limit, otherwise, what is the point? Who do we still want to protect? Second, as we all know, the rules are only effective if there are sanctions. And that is what Parliament is asking for, that there be sanctions if Member States do not want to play the game, or if they are dragging on sending information or sending false information. Thirdly, of course, in this process, we want to strengthen the role of the Commission. We all know that, we cannot be a judge and a party. No system works when you are both a judge and a party, and yet that is what the Council wants to achieve. Fourthly, in order to combat these abuses, we must of course call for more transparency. But real transparency, not cosmetic transparency. You know that too much information kills information, and what we are asking for - and what is in this text - is that there be a clear, accessible and understandable publication by all, and not just for specialists.  Finally, I will end with one last point: all companies operating in several countries will receive a European identification number. I think it is essential to more easily monitor it and reduce administrative burdens.

Above all, however, there is a negative competitive effect because small and medium-sized enterprises, which are only active nationally or which cannot or do not want to use these tax administration models, have disadvantages that add up to 20 to 25%. In this respect, we in the Special Committee are also calling for comprehensive measures to address this. Automatic exchange of information is an important single aspect of this – a necessary, but not a sufficient condition.

It is also very good that this standard is starting to be used in the EU at the beginning of next year. The new standard is an important tool against tax evasion and aggressive tax planning, and it is a major step forward. In this context, it is perfectly logical to phase out rapidly the standard used under the Savings Directive. Maintaining dual reporting systems – i.e. both in relation to the Savings Directive and the new standard – would not be reasonable in this case. It would provide a little more information, but the costs in terms of bureaucracy and duplication would be far greater than the value of the information we receive. Over the next 3-4 years, it is extremely important that the European Commission works actively and transparently to make the transition to the new global standard work. This applies not only to eu countries between them, but also to the five European non-EU countries and the 12 territories that will also move from the savings directive standard to the global standard.  The Commission should monitor developments closely and provide continuous information on risks of loopholes and other problems.

It is also true that there is this sense of injustice that can be felt by many Europeans who were called upon to contribute heavily during the crisis, while multinational companies, because they have extensive legal services, can use inequalities, holes, in the tax legislation of a particular Member State to evade tax, pay little or no taxes. where they make a profit. Yes, what we do - I say us - together is essential to the newfound trust. I would add that it is also a question of reducing inequality and, finally, a question of efficiency. With regard to tax evasion, we do not have the figures, because they are extremely difficult to come up with — we will have more data, by the way, after the transparency process has come to an end, because, by definition, there is a lot of data that is unknown. Tax evasion, I believe, is a significant source of revenue for public finances at a time when fiscal consolidation remains an imperative in the European Union, particularly in the euro area, but not just in the euro area.  From day one, this Commission has placed tax justice, transparency, the fight against tax evasion as one of its priorities, and I mean here - the authors of these interjections are no longer present - that I believe that, as much criticism and democratic debate are justified and legitimate, so much we must avoid populism, amalgamations and stigma. We need institutions. We cannot be content with anti-elite reflexes, or the denunciation of a particular personality. And the Commission is acting on this issue in a way, believe it, quite determined, in good faith. I am here naturally as Commissioner for Taxation, because this is my place, but I have the total confidence of President Juncker and carte blanche to move forward in a determined way, and I am working hand in hand with my colleague Margrethe Vestager; that's how we have to work.  I would like to take this opportunity to respond to Mrs. Joly, whom I am pleased to see here. She often exchanges with me indirectly, but I can tell her that the battle against tax evasion should not be confused with the battle against the Commission. In this case, I am convinced that the Commission and the European Parliament have a job to do together, and I would even say side by side. In fact, since you were talking about cooperation between us, in the context of the TAXE committee, I would like to make it clear here that an agreement has been reached with the chairman of this committee so that European parliamentarians can have access to the documents they want. Last week we made 89 documents available to MEPs: the transparency process is total on the part of the Commission, and we must also take into account the Member States and the need for confidentiality of certain data that companies have. Finally, I want to say a word about the Member States. I have heard them here criticised and I have said to Mr Ferber myself earlier how much I can share his regrets and how much I would have liked - that was the meaning of the Commission's original proposal - to go further on this or that subject. I'll get back to that.  But, at the same time, the Member States, they exist. And I see this agreement on tax rulings, this compromise, which I repeat to be of good quality, as an important signal that The Member States too are ready to commit to achieving these objectives, and I welcome that. I am starting to have a little experience of European affairs. I first sat in this Parliament in 1994. I was a member of the Council for seven years, including the 1990s. I have never, ever seen a tax text passed unanimously in seven months with a quality maintained in this way. It is proof that what you, the Members of the European Parliament have been doing, and indeed Mrs Joly have been doing for a long time, what the Commission is doing - and what it is doing in a determined way - is making a difference. So I understand the criticisms, I understand the regrets, but I also say that we must consider that today is an important day and that the report you are about to adopt must also highlight, if you do decide, that we are going in that direction. I would like to thank Parliament for its contribution to what I consider to be a success. I also thank Parliament for its support for The European measures to combat tax evasion and for the attention paid to preventing the use of techniques to evade these measures.  Some answers, now, a little more detailed on some of the questions posed by European parliamentarians.  Firstly, the question of the scope, which I believe is, at this stage, the most important point raised by Mr Ferber's report. The rapporteur believes that the directive should cover all tax rulings and not just cross-border tax rulings. It is true that, in this regard, the Commission itself had proposed to limit the scope of the compulsory exchange of information on cross-border tax decisions and transfer pricing agreements. The Council's compromise text also targets these cross-border decisions covering a wide range of such decisions.  Why would you do that? I would start by saying that the extension to non-cross-border decisions would have had, and would have the effect of significantly increasing the administrative burden of public authorities, without perhaps allowing the tax authorities to focus or focus their attention on the main issues. In addition, we have acted on the legal basis offered by the treaty, which is the legal basis of the internal market. The question is whether the other rescripts could be affected by this legal basis. However, I do not think, Mr rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, that we should be considered to have reached the end of the story. I think it is quite relevant that the European Parliament continues to insist on this dimension, since in a later phase we may have to go further on an appropriate legal basis; that is the position that the Commission, through me, is defending here. On retroactivity, another important point made by Mr Ferber, the Council's compromise text provides for a five-year retroactivity, which is shorter than the ten years suggested by the Commission. But I draw your attention to a point that you will not have missed: we are faced with a wider field that covers not only all the rescripts still valid issued since 2012, but also those that are no longer valid if they were made between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2016. The compromise also provides an exemption for SMEs with annual net sales of less than 40 million euros, with the exception of those that mainly carry out financing and investment activities.  That is what led us, which led me, in the discussions in the Council, to take into account the arguments that have been presented to us, and I think in the end that a five-year period, in combination with the exemption granted to SMEs, with the wider scope of the rescripts, allows for a balanced and solid compromise, and that is why the Commission has gone in the direction of this compromise.  In particular, Mr. Bayet asked me about a tax identification number. The Commission's proposal does not include a provision on the use of a European tax identification number. What for? For a simple reason: because such a number does not yet exist today. Nevertheless, this is a technical but also a political issue on which the Commission has been working since its 2012 action plan to combat tax evasion and evasion. That is a modality that I think is important, but we could not, and we cannot, wait for such a number to start exchanging rescript information. Finally, two final points: firstly, the issue of sanctions which has been raised by many of you and which had already been raised, I remember, at my first hearing before the TAXE Committee. The mechanism we have chosen is a mechanism that addresses the impact that transparency can have on the behaviour of multinationals. I'm betting here - and I think he'll be a winner - that's what it's going to be. Transparency will have the effect - contrary to the Law of Gresham, which, as you know, drives the right currency in favour of the bad - to, I am sure, to remove the bad rescripts, that is, those who lend to abusive or aggressive uses in favour of techniques of forecasting, anticipating the position of companies, which are not in themselves reprehensible. We did not choose to ban rescripts, we chose transparency. As for the Commission's presence in the scheme, I can assure you that it is a battle that I delivered, on foot, in front of those who thought it was superfluous. The presence of the Commission ensures that there is an arbitrator somewhere who can then initiate proceedings. And that is why the work that we are going to do together, together with my colleague Margrethe Vestager, is proof that there can be such mechanisms, and we will obviously have a stronger basis with the new directive, which I believe will be adopted as a result of the Commission's proposal, the Council's agreement and your own report. Finally, I would like to remind you that the fight for transparency is a fight that will not stop. I have spoken here of the revolution of transparency, and I can assure you of our political determination, that of the Commission, of my personal political determination, to go all the way. I repeat here what I said in our introductory remarks, namely that this Commission wants to take over the ACCIS or CCCTB project, including the consolidation that is necessary for companies for reasons that are both transparent and effective. I repeat that this Commission wants to show what the principle of effective taxation can bring. We are in an absurd situation where too many multinational companies, for the reasons you know, do not pay, or pay little tax where they make a profit. Again, it is a question of trust that will have to be resolved. Finally, the Commission is working on the publication of country-by-country information. I ask the European Parliament for a little more patience and a little more confidence. My colleague Jonathan Hill and I wanted to put in place an approach which, it is true, starts with a consultation and will have to continue with an assessment, a test, an evaluation. It is not a question of evacuating the question, but of seeing under what conditions the publication of country-by-country information can reconcile transparency and economic efficiency without penalising the business investment that is necessary for employment. For my part, I have expressed a very clear political preference, namely that, which said advertising, means public access. But we also have to take economic realities into account.  So we are at the bottom of an alternative: either we will follow what the OECD says, which, I remind you, to stick to exchanges between administrations, or we go further - I repeat, it is rather my personal preference, provided that it does not penalise companies. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you for your participation in this debate, I thank the rapporteurs and the shadow rapporteurs for their work. I think that beyond the differences or the nuances, we all agree that there is a new political approach that allows us to go further, to go harder and to go faster.

There has been really good cooperation on all the files we have been considering and I found great support from my shadows on my file. There has also, I have noted, been quite a lot of movement amongst Members of this House on the issue of tax, partly as a result of citizen outrage at multinational tax avoidance, but also as they have learned more – as they have gathered more information as a result of the TAXE Committee – and in my mind that is one of the main achievements of the TAXE Committee. To do our job properly we need information and we need evidence. How else can we make good policy? I welcome the statement from the Commissioner that more documents have been made available, but I am afraid that having documents in a reading room where they are effectively behind lock and key is simply not good enough. It does not feel like transparency and we need to have better access to information than that. We also need to protect whistleblowers who are acting in the common good. We do not always see eye to eye across the different political groups in this Parliament, but we have cooperated to protect public tax revenue and to ensure that there is a level playing field between the corporations who can arrange to reduce their tax contributions and the SMEs that are the backbone of our European economy.

Mr President, Commissioner Moscovici, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his excellent work and for the work she has done. I am pleased that we can vote tomorrow on the recasting of the Package Travel Directive. Changes in the travel market and the growing trend towards online travel bookings have made it urgently necessary to modernise and adapt the 1990 Directive. In the meantime, a wide range of new and online booking models have emerged which are not covered by the current directive. Today, there is no longer only the classic package tour, but different elements of a trip can be put together according to the wishes of the traveller. The revised rules will strengthen the rights of travellers in Europe as a whole. New booking models are now covered by the scope and travellers will be more comprehensive and better informed about their rights. However, we have also succeeded in taking into account the economic interests of the providers – e.g. tour operators, travel agencies or hoteliers – so that the result found takes into account both their and the interests of the travellers in a balanced way.  For Parliament's negotiating team, the inclusion of click-through bookings within the scope of the directive and its equality with the classic package holiday was mandatory. Click-through bookings are such bookings on the Internet where certain data of the booker is automatically transferred. Therefore, if you book a flight first and then a second travel service, i.e. a hotel, the name of the traveller and the payment methods are automatically transferred. We want the same liabilities to be granted here and the same insolvency protection as for a package holiday, because this type of booking gives the impression that you are booking a package by clicking on the next website. In the beginning, the Council had spoken out against the equality of click-through bookings. This would have meant that in such a case there would have been no liability and no insolvency protection for the entire package. It would have been just the reduced form. The booker, the traveller should have contacted the respective provider in order to get his rights. We were then able to reach the compromise by adding the e-mail address in addition to the name and payment methods. We have had a very difficult time for Parliament on this issue, because we cannot rule out the possibility of circumventing the way in which the very narrow definition of click-throughs is now possible. That is why we could only agree to the compromise if, after three years, the Commission – as it has promised – carries out a review to see what the outcome of the click-throughs is, if it is recorded, if it is not covered, if necessary, it needs to be adjusted or extended to the definition. Overall, we have managed to make the text clearer and more comprehensible and to enforce many of the European Parliament's first-reading points. For example, we have introduced the definition of ancillary services which are not intended to justify a package holiday. We have been able to make it clear that it makes no difference whether you rent a car or a motorbike; together with a flight or booked accommodation, this combination automatically becomes a package holiday. We have introduced a uniform right of withdrawal, whereby the consumer can withdraw from the contract free of charge if the price increase is more than eight percent. In addition, we were able to enforce better conditions for the consumer in exceptional and unavoidable conditions on site. If, in the event of exceptional unavoidable circumstances, the tour operator is unable to transport the package traveller back, the tour operator will now have to cover the costs of the extended stay of up to three nights. Against the background of the ash cloud in 2010, such a regulation was important to us. Parliament had asked for five nights, and the compromise was then three, but with the caveat that if, for example, the Passenger Rights Directive were to be enforced for five days, that would also apply here. I would like to take this opportunity to express my special thanks to the Latvian Presidency and the negotiating team in the Council, to the colleagues of the Commission, to our staff on the IMCO Committee, who have been effectively available at all times, to my shadows and their staff and to the staff of our political groups.

The 1990 Package Travel Directive gave consumers important rights regarding pre—arranged packages and established a legal framework for the package travel sector. I am speaking now on behalf of Mme Jourová, who cannot be here, and I wish to applaud her for the job that has been done. Digital technologies have changed the way in which we organise our travel. Today, consumers are increasingly seeking customised combinations of travel services online instead of ready-made products from a travel brochure. This is increasingly tending to mean that travellers are either not protected by the directive or else the protection is unclear. That is why it was necessary to modernise the existing EU rules on package travel so as to make them fit for the present digital age. The new directive on which you will vote tomorrow will offer protection not only for pre—arranged packages, but also for customised combinations of travel services, known as dynamic packages, especially if they are booked online. At the same time, the new directive will provide a minimum level of protection for linked travel arrangements which are looser combinations of travel services. There will be clear information for travellers on whether they are being offered a package with full protection or a linked travel arrangement with limited protection, including compulsory standardised information. These changes will double the share of protected trips in the EU from 23% to 46% and will bring almost 120 million additional trips a year within the scope of the directive. Furthermore, the right of travellers who buy a package will be improved and clarified. There will be clearer rights for travellers when something goes wrong during the trip and improved termination rights. Travellers will be entitled to extended accommodation for at least three days if the return journey cannot be carried out on time because, for example, a natural disaster. There will also be explicit rules on liability for booking errors.  As agreed during the interinstitutional negotiations, I would like to confirm that when revising the 2009 guidance on the application of Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, the Commission will also address the issue of commercial practices whereby travel services providers who market their services online offer additional services in an unclear or ambiguous manner, such as hiding the option of not booking any further services, and the Commission will inform Parliament on how its views have been taken into account when the revised guidance is adopted, which is fast. Travel businesses will also benefit from the new directive. Outdated requirements for travel brochures will be abolished and managed business travel will be exempted from the directive. Finally, increased harmonisation, for instance with regard to precontractual information requirements, in the light of the rules, as well as the mutual recognition of the insolvency protection obtained in other Member States will facilitate cross–border transactions, thereby enhancing consumer choice. Ladies and gentlemen, the text that is now presented to you for adoption is the result of very intensive and, I must say, sometimes difficult negotiations and compromises between the Council and Parliament. I would like to extend my thanks in particular to Mrs Birgit Collin-Langen, the rapporteur on this file, the shadow rapporteurs, and Mrs Vicky Ford, the Chair of the Internal Market and Consumers Committee who all were instrumental in coming to an agreement with the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 73, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "Andreas SCHWAB", "mepid": "28223", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I too, of course, would like to begin by thanking all those who have been involved in this dossier, which has been negotiated for years, very warmly. That was the case with Mr Hans-Peter Mayer in the last parliamentary term, and it then passed into the really excellent hands of Birgit Collin-Langen, who made this dossier a truly acceptable compromise. Because we in the European Parliament talk so often about compromises and end up not getting to the point, I would like to use my remaining speaking time to present this compromise. It is true that, with this revision of the Package Travel Directive, we are adapting to the digital age, with more and more tourists booking their journeys via the Internet, entering into a cascade of links with which they are linking more and more services that they accept as related services, and the break-up of which would ultimately mean a really difficult situation for them in the time of travel.  With this directive, with the restrictions that the rapporteur has mentioned, we are really taking this into full account. However, it is true that when defining the package holiday as we have now done, it is also possible for small tourism companies, such as small Alpine hotels or small hotels in the Black Forest – a region from which I come – that when the customer not only books the hotel for two nights, but also wants to have the visit to the swimming pool opposite the hotel, it is possible to have the hotel handled by the hotel. , in the end, a package holiday could also have been achieved from a legal point of view. It will be important here that we achieve the balance between consumer rights on the one hand and a fair functioning internal market in tourism on the other. However, I am confident that this will succeed.

The people and consumers who decided to move for the reasons I mentioned earlier have always been penalised. We have now broadened the scope of assisted tourism services and this is an important step forward. We have excluded specific sectors from the directive with a positive compromise such as the one on business travel or on the packages put together by non-profit-making associations. The text has also been significantly improved with regard to contractual and pre-contractual information, and I consider this to be at the heart of the measure.

So I am happy to support today this proposal for a directive that takes into account the digital revolution and seeks to make life easier for us, citizens who are composing our travel packages over the Internet. The holiday is, or should be, a moment of rest and relaxation for us, but unfortunately many of us have already experienced situations where not everything develops according to our needs. These feelings are doubled at the moment when we do not know who to turn to, from whom to get help. For this reason, I welcome the fact that the new directive answers these questions, clearly gives the rights and obligations of consumers, we will know who is responsible for what, and we can also know who to contact and claim compensation for. I also welcome the fact that once this directive enters into force, each of us will have the opportunity to transfer our travel packages to someone else if we cannot travel for any reason. We will not lose our money in case of illness or when the work will not allow us to do so. This directive, in my view, represents a good compromise between the defence of consumer rights, on the one hand, but also the possibilities of small and family-owned tourism businesses, which my colleague Schwab referred to. We have managed to prevent attempts to charge passengers with additional costs, while ensuring that every traveller is given services at the high level they rightly expect.

I cannot, however, support these proposals. Fundamentally, I take issue with the fact that this directive allows little or no scope for Member States to make changes that diverge from its provisions. By imposing this ridiculous level of harmonisation, you are simply presuming that all changes to this directive will be suitable for all 28 Member States. Well, I can tell you something today, that is not the case. For my country, the United Kingdom, these changes are not entirely suitable. If I may reference a UK government report directly, the proposal is far from perfect. Why should the UK Government be bound to abide by something it does not fully support?

Mr. President! In fact, the recasting of the directive will make holidaymakers better off in the future by asking them for easier recourse, central contact points and simple help even in emergencies. But at first too little consideration was given to the tour operators. Especially in a tourism country such as Austria, the plan to substantially increase the liability of small and medium-sized hotel companies, as well as travel agencies, met with considerable criticism.  In some respects, this criticism was also received positively, so that travel agencies can now offer certain services in the package without automatically becoming liable for the organisers. Nevertheless, the bureaucratic burden on tourism companies will increase in the future, which will inevitably lead to additional financial burdens, as shown by the example of the obligation to safeguard their own insolvency. On the other hand, the directive could well have gone further in favour of holidaymakers. For example, click-throughs, i.e. the click-through offers, are now covered by the policy. However, only cases are recorded in which the holidaymaker's name, e-mails and credit card details are transferred from one page to the next, which is completely unusual in practice. In this context, I also welcome the introduction of a revision clause to respond to further developments in the online sector.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur. First of all, thank you very much for your comments. Let me briefly summarise. Firstly, in view of the changes in the travel market, in particular the trend towards online booking, a recast of the Package Travel Directive is essential. Secondly, the present recast of the directive sets a new and sound basis for the balancing act between the interests of consumers on the one hand and the interests of suppliers on the other. It is balanced and meets the interests of both sides.  I am of course aware of the concerns of the smaller hoteliers, especially from Austria and partly also from Germany, and also of travel agencies in Germany. We have included very, very many suggestions made by the organisations there in the directive, and we have been in regular contact with very, very close contacts, particularly with HOTREC in Austria.  I firmly believe that the remaining problems of transposition into national law must be resolved. But we have managed to open up everywhere that we can work on it.  This directive shows once again the importance that the European Union attaches to consumer protection. Many directives in this area of law have already been transposed into national law. The EU is now taking another target, the importance of which must not be underestimated in practice. Once again– and this is really particularly important to me in the end, I would like to express my sincere thanks to all those who have contributed to the drafting of this directive as shadow rapporteurs, assistants and staff. It was difficult at times, but there was always a friendly, constructive way of working, so I think that is certainly a reason for the result.

It is vital that we continue to develop values-based trade policies, as is very much the theme of the new trade policy of the Commission. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the collegial cooperation during which we focussed on updates needed to close the loopholes in the current EU regime. The anti–torture regulation combines prohibitions of goods on the one hand with licensing requirements for trade in listed goods on the other hand. It governs a ban on trade in so–called single-use torture and execution items and related technical assistance under Annex 2. But it also looks at an authorisation system for multi—purpose items that could be misused for torture and executions: for example, lethal injections. We see this in Annex 3. The overhaul of the existing EU controls of trade in torture instruments has been long overdue. In this update we must ensure a correct mix of EU legislative, administrative, judicial and external measures. The absence of a multilateral export controls regime does complicate this task. Still, we seek coherence of the EU’s export controls, including military, dual use, firearms and torture goods lists, without subjecting items to duplicate controls and making things more complicated. The Commission proposes to strengthen the controls of torture goods to include certain medical substances and to broaden the scope to include brokering. I support this kind of approach of necessary and proportionate controls without creating unnecessary burdens for legitimate trade. In this regard it is also key that we seek a more level playing field in Europe. At the same time as we act now, our policies and systems should be future–proof and flexible, so as to be able to adjust to changing technologies or changing realities elsewhere in the world. Specific item lists can provide clarity for exporters and importers to make it easier for them to comply. We have also made sure that it is very clear and that there is no doubt about legitimate access to medicines and pharmaceuticals which, of course, for the EU is an important market, and it must not be hindered by measures to curb the abuse of lethal injection. While we observe that foreign trade transactions are becoming more and more complex, we have to look for an effective set of enforcement measures, and this should also include the marketing and financial services that do take place and are related to this industry.  We have asked for reporting and exchange of information between Member States via a secure encrypted system, so that rejected licences and other notifications or important information can be shared and can help states coordinate.  As the Commission can more flexibly adapt the regulations and the items that are at stake, we do ask, as a Parliament, to be duly informed and involved. Finally, we look to industry to take its own responsibility to make sure that the EU does not trade, broker, transfer or otherwise get involved with goods or services that are used for the death penalty or torture. I believe – and I think all of our colleagues believe – that in this text we put forward concrete proposals for improvement in this file, all with the goal to make sure that the EU acts as a values–based global player and that this specific, quite technical, aspect of trade is upgraded and implemented in a way that is both flexible and effective.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 104, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I want to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Schaake, for the excellent work that she has done on this, of course with input from other colleagues as well. As was said, we will be discussing some very technical elements, but let us not forget that we are talking about highly politically—sensitive issues such as ending the death penalty, torture and ill-treatment, which are key priorities for all the work of the European Union. It is in fact an anomaly that so many countries still have the death penalty and that so many thousands of people are still waiting in death row all over the world, but the fact is that it has actually decreased. One hundred and forty countries do not apply the death penalty today and 98 have legally abolished it, compared to 59 twenty years ago, so this is going in the right direction, but that does not mean that we should rest – there is so much to do. We have different tools at our disposal in foreign policy, but trade also can play a very important role and that is why this report is so important. Trade can be a leverage to promote, around the world, European values such as human rights, sustainable development, fair and ethical trade and the fight against corruption, and those values are the pillars of the newly proposed trade strategy by the Commission. The regulation we are talking about, Regulation (EC) No 1236/2005, takes account of this – the role of trade – to restrict foreign trade in goods that could be used for executions, torture or ill-treatment, and we welcome very much the effort done by the European Parliament to amend the regulation. We largely share the spirit and the approach taken by the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the rapporteur and Parliament, although some of the amendments in the report call for measures without precedent in export-control legislation and could be a bit difficult to implement in practice. We support several amendments, such as Amendment 6 extending the proposed definition of ‘broker’ to cover nationals from Member States not resident or established in the Union. This is acceptable in principle, but it could be difficult to enforce, so the inclusion of foreign subsidiaries of legal persons incorporated in the EU should of course not go beyond what is compatible with international law. Amendments 9 and 10 on the transport of transiting goods whose export and import is prohibited by the regulation are also acceptable for the Commission if Amendment 10 does not cover more than non-union goods. It is related to Amendment 15, and that can also be accepted; we just have to make sure that it is formulated in compatibility with WTO requirements. Amendment 21 referring to the transmission of information to human rights oversight bodies is also acceptable. Of course, here, companies requesting an export authorisation that submit information to competent authority have a legitimate interest in not giving certain data and making them public, so we need to make sure how the text is drafted here. Furthermore, we can accept Amendments 18 on best practices for technical assistance, 19 on guidelines and 26 on the report published by the Commission on the implementation, if you can agree that this is not an obligation for the Commission. We can also accept Amendment 2 adding human dignity and then several other more technical amendments that I will not go into now. I mentioned that some of the proposed measures are without precedent in export-control legislation. Last spring, Members approved here in Parliament Regulation 479 on common rules for exports, which confirmed the basic rule of trade policy: that exports are to be free unless trade restrictions are necessary to achieve an accepted objective, such as the protection of public morals. Torture, ill treatment and the death penalty are, of course, never acceptable, but we just make need to make sure that trade restrictions to promote respect for human rights meet the necessary trust. In this regard, while we fully understand the rationale of a view to propose an end-use or catch-all clause, we think it could lead to the introduction of restrictions going beyond what is necessary and preventing a level playing field for exporters. This could present a challenge to the uniformity of the Union’s trade policy, and for this reason the Commission had instead proposed the urgency procedure, which would help us to deal with most of the cases that could be addressed in a more proportionate manner. But we are willing to see if those objectives, which are basically the same, can be reconciled in a formula that we can agree upon. Regarding the amendment on the definition of brokering services, number 5, it would make the regulation cover a range of activities, financial services and insurance related to goods that are outside the Union, and that would be very difficult to monitor and control. But rather than amending the definition, we could identify which restrictions on which services need the necessity test and then use of specific drafting to regulate those activities. We recognise the usefulness of the Coordination Group and we share the objective behind that amendment. We just need to be very careful to make sure that that article is not at odds with the agreed arrangement for delegated powers in the treaty. We would need to find an appropriate formula to create a forum for consultations between Member States, stakeholders, civil society and the Commission. As you know, the EU works towards the abolition of the death penalty in all countries. The countries that are included in the proposal, in the authorisation of the annex, have ratified the second optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights without reservation, so they agreed to abolish the death penalty. When controlling exports to prevent EU involvement in executions in third countries, we should focus our efforts on countries that have not abolished it, and therefore we disagree with Amendments 33, 35 and 37 because there is nothing to show that these countries concerned would have applied the death penalty, despite the ratification of the protocol. Let me conclude – it has become rather technical – by expressing my conviction that this report, by the rapporteur and many of you, is a very good basis for further work to make the regulation into a more robust export—control regime that promotes respect for fundamental rights without unduly restricting foreign rights.

That is why, in 2010, the Council, then chaired by the Socialist Government of José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, urged the Commission to carry out a reform of the Regulation. Five years later we can be here today debating; a long time has passed.

Let me thank again the rapporteur and all the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which has been involved as well, and reiterate the Commission’s determination to have an ambitious regulation in place to restrict foreign trade in goods that could be used for executions or ill—treatment or torture.

On the implementation and monitoring, I think that the coordination group – or whatever we call it in the end – can have a very important role there. Also, the Commission has, via delegated acts, the powers to regularly modify the Annex to make sure that it is kept up to date. We will also present next year a review of the export control system for dual use – many of you have referred to this, this evening, as well – in order to make sure that we have an even better regulation on items that can be misused in violation of human rights, which would be another very important milestone.  I am sure that with such a strong agreement to really have a good regulation updated here, we can find a way to overcome the remaining difficulties and find a way to amend them in the right way so that we have a workable and efficient system that is proven for the future and equipped to ensure rapid reaction when a risk arises.

Commissioner, thank you for your very detailed reply to the text that we have worked on together in this House. I note many points of overlap – if not literally, then at least in spirit – and that is a reason for optimism. I think that it has been well established by everyone who spoke that we share the goal of ending the death penalty and torture, and this is one way to contribute to that. It is not as widely shared a goal in this House. Unfortunately, it is not entirely unanimously shared, but at least by a large majority.  On the implementation: yes, of course measures must be feasible and even agile. That is our goal too, but I think we are being both ambitious and realistic, as my colleague Loones also said. It has been 10 years since this regulation has been updated, so we feel very strongly that what we do now has to be future—proof and solid and should be able to last for quite a while, so what we do now we must do well and make it a robust mechanism that deals with all the loose ends.  I also want to end by saying thank you to civil society and human rights organisations that have been very involved in helping us to push for these much—needed reforms.

Cooperation was exemplary and, a pleasant surprise for me, the vote in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO) was unanimous. I hardly have to note how rare this unanimity is and that is in itself a message, an indication that the ECI is properly regarded as a key instrument in the framework of the institutional structure of the European Union. Now the underlying idea is both straightforward and subtle. The citizens of Europe should have the means to launch legislative initiatives on issues of concern at the European level. Everyone is aware of the reality of the remoteness between the EU and its citizens, and the ECI is one way of bridging it. Let me add here immediately that the right of legislative initiative by citizens does not undermine the representative democracy that is the core value of any democratic system – ourselves in other words. No, the ECI enhances European democracy by introducing a form of civic action that communicates in parallel with what we are doing.  Nor is the ECI a form of direct democracy where citizens foregather to take legislative action. That may have worked in the classical Greek city states but is nonsense when 500 million citizens are involved. What the ECI can do is to adopt a single issue and mobilise a sufficient number of individuals in a form of collective action. The mobilisatory element should not be underestimated. The process of collecting a million signatures in a year demands organisational skills, enthusiasm and commitment to doing something political in Europe. From that perspective the ECI is a way of bringing citizens into the European political field in an unmediated fashion.  Ultimately there will always be some tension between the politics of representation and political involvement from below. The idea that a given number of citizens can act together on a single issue of concern adds something new to the political palette of Europe and, let it be noted, is already available as a form of political action in some EU Member States. What differentiates the European political field from that of a Member State is that legislation is initiated by the Commission. The ECI changes this by adding the citizens to those with the right of launching legislation. This shift therefore changes the equation in European politics by adding a new actor. So much for the underlying theory behind the ECI; practice to date has not really fulfilled the promise of the instrument. Over 50 initiatives have been organised and none, not one, has reached the statute book. By anyone’s failure criteria this is 100%. Indeed, in my consultations with civil society I have detected a clear sense of disappointment with the way in which the Commission has handled the ECIs that it has received. There have been complaints of bureaucratic dilatoriness – the ‘insolence of office’, the ‘law’s delay’, to quote Shakespeare – and a general sense that while the Commission has dealt with the instrument with complete correctness legally, it has rather missed the political point, that of civic involvement. So the burden of my report is intended to address these shortcomings and to urge the Commission to respond to the voice of the citizens with greater flexibility than hitherto. I have every hope that the promised reform of the ECI will make it a genuinely effective instrument.

This is a good basis for me to discuss something that already came up during my hearing and that is something we really want to build on.  We, the Juncker Commission, have said that we would act on big things and concentrate our efforts there. That is what we do, but we also need to change how we do it. In that context, I believe the ECI can be a valuable contribution. It is a tool with which citizens can directly try to influence policy. It allows citizens to influence the agenda at European level and to bring to the fore the concrete issues which most concern them. It is therefore a tool to initiate political dialogue. As a member of the European Convention, when I represented the Dutch Parliament, I was myself involved in the design of the Citizens’ Initiative. Today, it is part of my responsibilities to ensure that it works properly and thus works better.  It is still a young tool, but we already have some experience. Last March the Commission reported on the Initiative’s first three years. It has started to show its potential. Some 33 initiatives were registered, and collected signatures. Three successfully gathered over one million signatures each. Overall, about 6 million citizens gave their signatures – impressive numbers of people. All these efforts have succeeded in forging links among like—minded people across the continent. They helped spark genuine pan—European debates and brought new ideas into the European public space. This is promising for European participatory democracy and the emergence of a European demos. But, at the same time, we need to work to make the Citizens’ Initiative more user—friendly. I note that several points put forward in your report, Mr Schöpflin, converge with our report’s conclusions. We are already implementing a number of these measures. Let me just mention a few.  The Commission has established a dedicated point of contact, which has already replied to around 1 200 questions in all EU languages on rules and procedures. We are also providing more specific support directly to organisers once their ECI has been registered, including on legal requirements and logistical or technical aspects. Going beyond our obligations on the regulation, we also provide ad hoc online hosting on Commission servers free of charge. Data requirements have sometimes been flagged as an issue. Here we will continue our efforts to encourage Member States to simplify their data requirements so that all citizens can actually exercise the right to sign an ECI, should they wish to do so. We should also be open to do more if that is needed. I am therefore here today to listen very carefully to Members’ assessment of how the instrument is working and discuss their ideas on how to improve it. The Commission takes very seriously indeed Parliament’s call for a legislative revision of the ECI Regulation. We are currently in the process of assessing the need, scope and objective for such a revision. We are collecting factual evidence and are listening widely to stakeholders. The Commission would like to thank Parliament for its constructive approach towards improving this important tool. I would like to personally thank and congratulate Mr Schöpflin for a job very well done in analysing the implementation of the ECI, reflecting on possible improvements and building consensus across political groups and committees. He is not trying to make party political work with us; he is trying to help citizens reconnect – or, sometimes, connect for the first time – with our European level of political dialogue. I think the Commission should be prepared to do whatever is needed to make that easier, more accessible and more successful.

Mr Timmermans, we have noted with great pleasure the commitment you have made on behalf of the Commission.

Secondly, we need to facilitate collection, and here we have proposed a whole series of points which, if accepted, can make it easier to collect and thus facilitate citizens' initiatives: age, methods of filing, the separate times between registration and the start of collection, online signatures... are many things.

Mr President, the European Citizens' Initiative is one of the most innovative ways of the Lisbon Treaty to enhance the democratic legitimacy of the European Union. Indeed, who would not welcome the greater involvement of the citizen in European affairs? However, we consider it appropriate, after a period of four years, to evaluate its operation, without questioning the very principle of the European initiative. Indeed, many initiatives have faced various obstacles to the point of having to abandon their project for good.  Our colleague, Mr Sch-pflin, has given a good account of the work of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and I would like to congratulate him on that. The Committee on Constitutional Affairs was almost unanimous in its desire to make improvements to the functioning of the citizens' initiative. We support proposals to ease procedures. In the same vein, it would be wise for us to see the Commission register only the part of an initiative within its scope and to pass on the remaining parties or parties to the competent, national or regional authorities. If we share the essence of the views expressed by the rapporteur, we would like to make it clear, however, as an ALDE group, that the Commission should also accept initiatives that concern the primary law of the European Union. From this point of view, it is obvious that the functioning of the European Union is often paralyzed by the limits imposed on it by the Treaty. The Commission, having the right to initiate a treaty change, could thus become the custodian of proposals from European citizens.

No wonder that it was unanimously approved in our meeting of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs (AFCO).

I am referring to the necessary amelioration of the follow–up to any successful ECI after its submission. This would be a clear signal of our readiness to reinforce also the European initiatives.

Mr President, the European Citizens' Initiative, established by the Treaty of Lisbon, is an important conquest of the peoples of Europe and strengthens participatory democracy within the Union.

As coordinator of the ECR in the Committee on Petitions I have repeatedly highlighted the weaknesses of the existing legal framework of Regulation 11/79, 2011, which needs to be amended in order to: 1) ensure the widest possible participation of citizens, especially in the current period of economic crisis, 2) to enhance transparency and efficiency. Everyone must therefore understand that the European Citizens' Initiative is a primary exercise of the very democratic function, which could be used by the citizens and movements of the European South to create a broad front against austerity and poverty, against the promiscuity of the European Central Bank and the Europe of banks, and we anti-monumental citizens will take an initiative in this regard.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 143, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "Pascal DURAND", "mepid": "124693", "text": "   Mr President, Mr Timmermans, in 2009 the Lisbon Treaty tried to create a direct link between citizens and Europe.

I look forward to working closely with Parliament to make sure that, where we can, we will improve the Initiative, and probably we will have to look at the regulation at some stage. The Commission will certainly not shy away from doing that if it is considered necessary. At the same time, you can turn the Initiative into something it is not and then be critical of the fact that it is not what you want it to be, but it is in fact quite straightforward: it is based on the Treaty. The Treaty is something all Member States agreed on, signed and ratified in the national parliaments. We cannot go beyond the Treaty, even though it would perhaps be nice to go beyond the Treaty. The Commission is responsible for applying the rules in the Treaty, and the rules in the Treaty say that the European Citizens’ Initiative is an instrument to involve citizens in dialogue. It is not an initiative to give citizens the right of initiative in legal matters: that is a different animal. If you are not happy with that animal, fine, but do not accuse the animal of not being what you want it to be. It was intended to be an addition to representative democracy, to make sure that people get involved in the debate in representative democracy, not an alternative to representative democracy. I am quite sure this Parliament would not want to put itself in an outside position and leave all that to citizens directly.  I think the deal here is that we involve citizens in a dialogue about policies. If the Commission applies the rules – and yes, it happens unfortunately quite a lot – we have to say that the initiatives taken are not within the existing rules. We can change the rules, and we will look into that. We can assist people taking initiatives in overcoming bureaucratic hurdles and other problems, and we certainly want to try to improve that. We have been trying already, and we receive all persons taking an initiative to advise them. Sometimes we also help them amend the questions, saying that if they reformulate them slightly then we can say they are within the rules. We are trying to be very cooperative with those who take initiatives, but you cannot blame the Commission for applying the rules. We would be amiss if we did not apply the rules simply because it would be nice to let people take initiatives. I will have to be firm on this, but I want to reiterate our willingness to work closely with Mr Schöpflin and his colleagues to make sure that we improve the system. I still see a lot of potential in this instrument. It is far too easy after a relatively short period of time to dismiss the instrument because it is not what one wants it to be. Do not make it bigger than it is, but do not disqualify it before we have done everything we can to make it work better, as is the intention of Mr Schöpflin and the others who supported him in making the report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 155, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "György SCHÖPFLIN", "mepid": "28135", "text": "   rapporteur. – Mr President, I would like to thank everybody who has taken part in this constructive debate. I think everyone has been constructive, perhaps with one or two exceptions. I am particularly grateful for the supportive words from Vice-President Timmermans. There are some issues, which I think have some saliency, that I would like to pick up on (I cannot, obviously, do a summary of everything that has been said). I think the point made by Mr Goerens about the revalorisation of democratic legitimacy is something that we must think about very seriously. Connecting the citizens has come up in a fair number of contributions. Then there is the follow-up problem, on which others spoke (Mr Terricabras notably). Nobody knows this, but actually I have a very old and very rusty degree in law, and one of the things I take away from this is that when it comes to legal regulations applying the rules – to quote Mr Timmermans – there is always some leeway in how one interprets these things. Here I would like to call for more flexibility: apply the rules but, where there is a grey area, think about the million people who have been involved. Finally, three short issues. Treaty change has come up: my own take on this is that yes, Treaty change will happen one day, but not in connection with the ECI, so primary law is not really a part of this. Secondly, as I understand it at the moment, an ECI can call on the Commission to act in particular ways, but as things stand cannot interdict legislation. This could well be reconsidered. Certainly, that is the input I have had from civil society. As I understand it, ECIs cannot affect current processes, even if inputs from stakeholders are widely regarded as a viable part of policy information – and whatever the status of citizens in the European political field, they are stakeholders.  I would like to end by saying that I very much thank Mr Timmermans.

The European Commission seems alarmed that its convenient bureaucratic system may have a say from the outside, and that one-off citizens may be taking the right of initiative out of their hands.

Mr President, the first cases of Ebola virus disease in the European Union and the United States quickly caused panic in the respective public opinion. Nothing like this from March to September 2014, when thousands of people infected with the virus had already died in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea, where the crisis hit hard. This crisis is systemic in many respects. First, with regard to systemic lack of global governance, the World Health Organization itself has acknowledged its share of responsibility for the slowness of the alert. Secondly, with regard to systemic poverty in the three crisis-hit countries, there is some eloquent evidence of its particularly acute nature: 80% live in extreme poverty, schooling lasts just four years on average, health systems are less resilient. Thirdly, at European level too, the systems are perfectable, particularly in terms of coordination between the 29 actors that are the Commission and the Member States.  The appointment of Commissioner Stylianides as the European Union's Ebola coordinator has finally led to a change in the search for European solutions for victims in the three African countries. As for the lessons that can already be learned from this crisis, first, the exemplary commitment of humanitarians, particularly MSF and the Red Cross, has contributed to a wide awareness and has aroused unanimous admiration, even though they have paid a heavy price. The fight against Ebola has claimed the lives of some 500 health professionals. Second, when the international community finally woke up, and in particular its pharmaceutical industry, responses to vaccine development could be found fairly quickly. Third, health systems in developing countries cannot be abandoned on the grounds that the recovery of public finances takes precedence over any other consideration. Fourth, there is an urgent need to address systematically the question of who is responsible for research and development in the treatment of rare diseases or that primarily affect only patients living in developing countries.  The political sphere, if acquired by the principle of non-indifference, can no longer rule out this problem. The European Parliament should take the lead in a new report on this issue in close cooperation with the Stylianides coordinator and taking into account the lessons to be learned from the European Parliament's mission in West Africa at the beginning of November. Fifth, there is an urgent need to rebuild the three countries, including not only health systems but also the economy, which have rapidly collapsed since the beginning of the epidemic. Finally, the European Parliament was right to claim and corroborate, year-round, its proposal to have at least 20% of its external official aid devoted to the development of basic social sectors, in particular, including, first and foremost, the health system. In conclusion, let us remember that there is no need to let our guard down in the face of an intelligent virus, alas intelligent, that is still likely to manifest itself in other forms than those already known. We are also aware of our moral obligation to make the right of patients to access treatment around the world a principle of lasting political action. Finally, let us not delay in helping Africa to take ownership of its own development, especially in health research and development.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 6, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 162, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Commission very much welcomes Charles Goerens’ report. I want to commend and thank Mr Goerens for his great work and, of course, for his dedication to the fight against Ebola. During this period we have had excellent and productive cooperation for which I am truly thankful to him.  The European Union has a special responsibility when it comes to promoting universal health coverage, supporting countries to achieve health–related sustainable development goals and to build resilient health systems better able to control outbreaks so we are better prepared when the next big epidemic strikes. The report remains very topical as this epidemic is not over. We have again been getting some new cases, unfortunately, in Guinea in recent weeks. We must remain engaged until we reach a resilient zero, until the affected countries fully recover. The European Union and Member States have pledged over EUR 2 billion. From this amount EUR 900 million comes from the Commission alone for response, recovery and research. We are also fully engaged in learning vital lessons from the Ebola crisis: for example, the October Luxembourg conference on lessons learned, which Commissioner Andriukaitis and I attended, came forward with important recommendations. These will fit into the Health Council conclusions in December. As the EU Ebola coordinator I will also report on the overall lessons learnt to the European Council at the end of this year. We have also been fully engaged in the G7 Health Ministers discussions on Ebola earlier this month, in which Commissioner Andriukaitis participated. We are pleased that the G7 Declaration expresses commitment to, and I quote, ‘strengthening health systems to enable the provision of basic healthcare [...] as well as water, sanitation and hygiene. The aim is to progressively achieve universal health coverage’. This is very important.  As Mr Goerens’ report clearly emphasises, basic healthcare and clean water for all are essential. We can all agree that building and reconstructing a resilient health system is also essential – health systems able to detect, monitor and contain a health crisis. What have been the main lessons for the EU from this crisis? There are many things we could write in our response at EU level. Our rapid and substantial Ebola funding for the emergency response, for recovery, for research; our role in organising the transport of assistance to West Africa; the very positive role of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control in deploying epidemiologists; also the crucial role of the four EU mobile laboratories or the EU medivac system that we deployed for all international health workers.  But at the same time there are also lessons from what did not go as well. The first lesson: the international community was and still is ill–prepared for a global health emergency. Global emergency and health governance need strengthening. This includes support to the WHO, the reform of the WHO and the review and implementation of international health regulations. Here our help plays a key role. We also had difficulties in rapidly deploying medical teams. Hence we are now working with Member States to establish a European medical corps using the voluntary pool system of the European Union’s civil protection mechanism.  Secondly, weak health systems in partner countries are a particular concern. The European Union has committed to comprehensive health systems’ strengthening; however, we learned from Ebola that we may not have been comprehensive enough. So we need to do more to strengthen national capacity, as I said, to provide health care for all and for outbreak control in particular. Thirdly, the weakest health systems are severely underfunded. Domestic resource mobilisation will not fill the gap soon. To have good preparedness and to achieve the health SDGs we need a minimum level of public health financing. Forty countries spend even less than USD 30 per capita per year. That is the real figure.  Fourthly, the Commission and Member States have to programme health aid more strategically, leaving no one behind. We have to counteract any tendency to withdraw collectively from the health sector, focusing on those countries falling below minimum public financing. We need to think about how we can deploy our collective EU health aid more effectively and more predictably. Last, but not least, the Commission and Member States should support a globally coordinated research effort to identify, make priorities and address recent gaps against future emergency epidemics. Capacity building through research has an important role to play in strengthening local health systems.

I believe that the lessons we must draw must arise from an honest and rigorous analysis of the European reaction during the first few months, which followed the alert launched by Doctors Without Borders. And global passivity in those first few months explains, in part, that the scale of the epidemic was so great, and its expansion uncontrolled.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to thank our colleague Charles Goerens warmly for his listening and cooperation in the preparation of this report. This is an important report that draws lessons from the major health crisis that hit West Africa in March 2014 and left more than 11,000 people dead. This Ebola crisis has dramatically highlighted the systemic weaknesses of developing countries in terms of health. It is therefore crucial that the European Union and development actors now and significantly strengthen aid to developing countries so that they can put in place effective health systems. This should be reflected not only in the infrastructure and sanitary facilities, but also in the training of medical personnel. Staff must be trained to respond appropriately to crises that arise.  One point that I also think is important to highlight in this report is the need to strengthen the governance of developing countries.

Structural adjustment programmes, imposed by the IMF and the World Bank in the 1980s and 1990s in Africa, deteriorated these countries' health systems, making them powerless in the face of an Ebola-caliber epidemic. Cuts and privatizations in European countries, such as Spain, have also undermined health systems and are responsible for mismanagement of treated Ebola cases, such as nurse Teresa Romero, which was spread out for lack of resources and resources, and not for any other reason. Two, the pharmaceutical industry is guided solely by the benefit and does not investigate the diseases of the poor, as has been demonstrated with Ebola. In short, austerity is urgently needed and robust health systems developed, and alternatives to the current model of drug research are also urgently needed.

At present, according to the information I have from these countries - one of my daughters and my son-in-law work in Guinea - there are still two cases of Ebola, including at the Red Cross treatment centre in Forécariah. What we are seeing, however, is that the European Union and the Member States have contributed more than EUR 1.9 billion and that health systems have not been improved much: it is a very long time to implement. I ask the Commissioner that within the framework of the European Development Funds, we should be assured that hospitals and clinics will really be built to keep up with these phenomena.  Similarly, with regard to IMI , these European funds for the clinical studies we have paid , I think we should ask for conditionality with regard to vaccines. There would have to be no more patents, so that there would be access to drugs. The last thing I would like to say is that nothing is won. We were very surprised to find that in a nurse who had been treated, Ebola virus disease was re-established or that the semen still contains the virus six months after a person has been treated.

The reform of the WHO is essential for future outbreaks in many other countries, maybe in Africa or elsewhere. This is why we need to promote this reform of the WHO. It will be the most important instrument for the next epidemic. Together, the Commission and the Member States should revisit development cooperation in health, where needed and in particular in the three African countries. I saw on the ground the problems in those three countries and I realised that the lessons learned may be the most important basis for the future for us as an international community, and we of course have to support those countries which are most in need. It is very important to achieve the health-related SDGs and, first of all, to build resilient health systems so that they are better prepared for possible future disease outbreaks – because we will, unfortunately, have more outbreaks in the future.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank all my colleagues who made an intervention in this report. Thank you for the kind words they have said to me, the same remark applies to Commissioner Stylianides. The theme that has been the subject of this report is very relevant because these are issues of life and death, so we must take them very seriously. Our Committee on Development, for years, has been stressing the need to devote more resources to promoting health sectors in developing countries. It did not miss any opportunity - either in the context of budget discussions or in specific reports on this subject - to stress the need for more efforts to promote research and development in African countries.  When it comes to development, we don't develop others, we have to give others the means to develop themselves. We have not missed any opportunity to insist on improving governance, whether global, international, European or African. There is no fatality in the theme we have just discussed, because there have been results. We have not missed any opportunity to stigmatize the slowness that characterized the reaction of the international community at the beginning, and in particular of institutional actors, and finally, things got under way, in particular thanks to the resolution we voted on in September 2014 which was, in my view, the best resolution we have ever voted here in this Parliament on health issues affecting developing countries.  A colleague said that we are ridiculous, and he opposed malaria and Ebola virus. But listen, ladies and gentlemen, it is not one or the other, it is one and the other, we must treat the Ebola virus and also malaria. It is not tuberculosis or AIDS, it is tuberculosis and AIDS; we must face all the challenges, and that is why we are now calling for at least 20% of the resources of official development assistance to be devoted to the development of the basic health sectors. In fact, the colleague who called this meeting ridiculous on the grounds that the benches were sparse left his seat two seconds after his speech.  Finally, let me stress that there is no need to let our guard down, and Michèle Rivasi has just said so. This virus is a fearsome virus. It arises in other forms, it makes us discover other means of transmission, so we are not at the end of our sorrows, all the more reason to remain vigilant. I believe that after the lesson or lessons we have just learned from the Ebola virus, I am more confident at the end of 2015 than at the beginning of the crisis, especially during the period from March to September 2014.  Thank you, and let me remind you of one last message. The report also stresses the question of who is responsible for research and development of new drugs. The market has an important role to play, but the market should not be allowed to act alone. I say this as a liberal, as a proponent of the development of the market economy. There are also whole beaches where politics has to take responsibility, and I hope that our Committee on the Environment and Health can, together with the Committee on Development, find, or at least initiate, the beginning of an answer to this question, which, I admit, is a difficult question. It was too big a piece to swallow in the context of this report, which is why we are inviting the committees concerned by this issue of our European Parliament to look at this extremely important aspect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 1, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 183, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   The debate has been closed.

While NGOs have been shown to be responsive and timely, international institutions and organisations have shown ineffectiveness, inadequacy and slowness in response to the mobilisation of aid, and the absence of who and the lack of research and development on medicines, diagnoses and vaccines have caused millions of deaths.

This is also about big money – money that needs to be controlled so that the European Union, however, the EU institutions have more authority, more acceptance among European taxpayers.  Very specifically, with regard to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology , an institute based in Budapest, it should be said that the Institute has introduced complementary ex post controls on grant transactions and that the quality of the control certificates received for grant transactions has been improved by improving the relevant instructions. The Institute is also now applying (this has changed) a more detailed and consistent certification methodology, and has improved the procurement procedure. So to sum up, there is certainly some progress, some improvement in terms of the level of certainty or legality, the correctness of transactions, especially those related to grants. This level has certainly increased and this needs to be noted. Nevertheless, it should be borne in mind that for the second time in a row the Court issued a qualified opinion to the Institute. It should also be strongly emphasised that the quality of certificates relating to around 87% of grant expenditure has been compromised as they have been issued by audit firms acting on behalf of grant beneficiaries. This is a huge and unnecessary exposure to possible irregularities. The further actions of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology need to be looked at, as two qualified opinions indicate that, however, the Institute is not functioning, or at least has not functioned properly in the past. At the moment, the focus should be on monitoring whether the Institute is following the changes. As far as ARTEMIS and ENIAC are concerned, in my opinion they do not require much discussion. I will not discuss them specifically here, as they have been merged into ECSEL. We will see what the concrete, real actions of this new unit will be. As far as the Council and the European Council are concerned – as I have pointed out on several occasions, both in my many previous reports and in speeches – the Council, as an EU institution, should have democratic responsibility to the citizens of the European Union to the extent that it is the beneficiary of the Union budget. Unfortunately, it is still here invariably – I stress all the time: invariably – many outstanding issues, because the Council persistently, quite predictably – I would say ironically – does not respond to the European Parliament's calls for regular submission of the relevant documents and explanations. Hence the proposal for another (this is no longer a surprise) refusal to grant discharge on our part, on the part of the European Parliament. I think that this match – unsympathic, bad, not building the authority of the EU institutions – between the European Parliament and the Council must finally be concluded.

The Commission takes note of the proposal submitted by the Committee on Budgetary Control to the plenary to grant discharge to the Joint Technology Initiative on Embedded Computing Systems (the ARTEMIS Joint Undertaking) and the Joint Technology Initiative on Nanoelectronics (ENIAC), the European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT), and to refuse discharge to the Council for the financial year 2013. The Commission is happy to note that Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control agrees that the ECSEL Joint Undertaking (JU), which is the successor of ARTEMIS and ENIAC, has implemented actions to address the remarks of the budgetary authorities, and that it therefore proposes to grant discharge for the year 2013. ENIAC and ARTEMIS have convincingly demonstrated that public-private partnerships, using a tripartite model that pools together Member State and EU funding with industrial investments, deliver important results such as leading edge low-power electronic chips and worldwide standards for software platforms for cars. These give industry in Europe a clear competitive advantage and increase its capacity to grow, as was illustrated by the high industrial investment in these partnerships. Both initiatives have had a very high leverage factor – every euro from the public side has resulted in an investment of at least EUR 3 by industry in the two initiatives. ENIAC and ARTEMIS therefore provide a unique opportunity and an effective means for industry, Member States and the EU to closely cooperate across Europe. This creates a critical mass for electronic components and systems that is of vital importance for the digital future of Europe. The initiatives have financed more than 3 000 of Europe’s best engineers and researchers in the field every year. Their work helps sustain at least 80 000 jobs in Europe per year. In the Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, ENIAC JU and ARTEMIS JU are merged in a new JU on Electronic Components and Systems for European Leadership (ECSEL). In ECSEL a structural solution is found for verifications and ex-post audits of new expenditure. In the draft resolution, the Commission is asked to carry out an evaluation to assess the activities of ENIAC and ARTEMIS to be considered for the 2014 discharge exercise. The Commission intends to reconcile this request with the ECSEL Regulation. The ECSEL Regulation provides that the Commission will conduct an interim evaluation of ECSEL that will include the final evaluation of ENIAC and ARTEMIS by 30 June 2017. To conduct separate evaluations on the very same projects would put a considerable administrative burden on the beneficiaries and the Commission. Finally, I would like to reiterate that the Commission will provide advice and full support to ECSEL in its continued efforts to address the concerns of the European Parliament. The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) has made significant improvements in the areas identified in the April Parliament decision. On the legality and regularity of its transactions, the EIT has reformed its audit methodologies, the EIT Knowledge and Innovation Community grant guidelines and procurement capacities and procedures. As a result, the combined error rate for the 2014 grants is only 0.9%. The EIT has also taken extensive measures to improve its planning and monitoring. Finally, we would like to note that the winner of this year’s EIT Change Award, Mr Govinda Upadhyay, was selected as a finalist in the Forbes’ 30 under 30 Social Entrepreneurs competition. This is precisely the kind of impact that the EIT was designed to create. As for discharge to the Council, the Commission regrets that a suitable solution has not been found between the two arms of the Budgetary Authority in this dispute lasting now for six years. The Commission considers that the institutions should cooperate for a smoother functioning of this procedure. The Commission hopes that this issue will be solved in a suitable manner for both institutions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 191, "date": "2015-10-26.json", "name": "Marian-Jean MARINESCU", "mepid": "33982", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, joint ventures are extremely important for research and development.

The new ECSEL structure already has one year of activity and we need to know exactly where it came from. The long-term implementation of projects should not be a reason to postpone the report.

I would first of all like to thank the rapporteur for his cooperation on the discharge reports. We initially refused to grant discharge for the EIT for a number of reasons. First of all, there was the 3% error rate detected in knowledge information community grants. Secondly, errors were found in procurement processes, and there were also some issues regarding staff retention. Since then we have had a progress report from the EIT, which shows they have made progress, and also recently I took the time to visit the EIT myself, and I heard and saw the progress which they have made. So, for example, as the Commissioner said, error rates are down to 0.9%, they put in place new procurement procedures, and they have also put in place new staff appraisal procedures, which will hopefully help in a reduction of the turnover in staff.

However, after receiving at the end of June a report from EIT providing information on the progress since the previous one, we can draw the following conclusions about the Institute in several different areas. In the domain of legality and regularity of transactions the Institute has improved the quality of audit certificates. The use of a new methodology has further improved the quality of ex—ante and ex—post verifications. The internal procedures of the Institute already fully comply with the respective public procurement rules. Further to the consultancy performed by the Institute’s internal audit capability, a number of activities have been implemented. In the area of budget and financial management there are positive changes related to improved planning and monitoring procedures, significantly improved absorption capacity of the beneficiaries and actions taken to alleviate the high staff turnover. As a result of the activities of the Commission’s Internal Audit Service we also observe positive developments, especially in the implementation of the elements of the institute’s action plan. By the end of 2015 it is expected the bulk of these actions will be completed. In the coming months we envisage the publication of a special report of the European Court of Auditors which will shed light on the ability of the institute to provide innovation in the EU, where I would like to discuss the distribution within the European Union of the different sectors of knowledge and innovation communities.

It has been six months since Parliament postponed the council's discharge, and today we are once again debating whether the Council will finally disclose information about its financial management. The discharge procedure is mandatory for all European institutions and the Council is no exception. The implementation of its budget must be under the same control as for all the European institutions. And how is it possible that Parliament, once again, as has been the last many years in a row, has no insight into the Council's budget? And how is it possible that, as for so many years in a row, there is no debate on the discharge of the Council representative?

However, key institutions, including the Council, must set an example in order to maintain the credibility of the European Union in the eyes of taxpayers. I am convinced that the call to the Council before members is no longer sufficient before the European public, which is why we in the Greens group for the 2016 budget have tabled an amendment that imposes a budget reservation on the Council for the first time.

Indeed, we already had a yellow card, which we showed to the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, and it is good that we have shown it, because it has proved that the institute can function and work better than before. There is some progress, not least because we have forced them to be more efficient, to work more efficiently.  As far as the Council is concerned – indeed, half a year ago we had a situation where we showed a yellow card, but as the old Polish proverb says, \"he talked grandfather to the picture, and the picture to him not once\". We have a situation where we all, as representatives of political groups, say that we can differ, but this is absolutely unacceptable. For the fifth year in a row, the same problem with the Council. Mr Soltész says that citizens expect – Mr Soltész is right. President Gräßle says that this is a scandal – this is a strong word, but it is in place, because the Council is really stubbornly evading cooperation. That just can't be the case. Mr Arnott is right, of course, to say that it is ' never ending story', speaking in his native language.  In short, we must show determination in this matter. This is a question of a certain honour of the European Parliament, of our responsibility to citizens.

We are facing a humanitarian catastrophe in Slovenia. It is very well known that the absorption potential of my country is ten times smaller than the number of refugees that have entered Slovenia in the last few days.

In mid-September, first on the Hungarian-Serbian border and then last week on the Slovenian-Croatian border, everyone could see the immeasurable human suffering and chaos that the politics of national selfishness can lead to. However, following Sunday's EU mini-summit on the refugee crisis, there is once again hope that cooperation between Member States will finally be replaced by national arrogrth and specific policies. Perhaps from now on, no national leader can act without negotiating and coordinating with another leader. Perhaps no one can hide from the obligation to register refugees and pass on the burden of the refugee crisis to another Member State. Today, refugees are seen by many as a threat to Europe, to European values. In my opinion, historically, it is the national selfishness that has been whipped up, the surrender of our Europeanism and principles, the closed-door policy, the special national policies that pose a threat.

Only the destruction and uprooting of ISIS can prevent new refugee waves from Syria. Syrian Kurds are calling for help. They are directly threatened in their existence and their discharge is genocidal in nature. I found out about that in Kobanê, the city that ISIS destroyed to the last house.

We are witnessing an unseen extinction crisis, yet we still allow trophy hunting. We have all heard the incomprehensible story of the demise of Cecil the lion. It struck a chord of revulsion with millions, and yet new permits continued to be issued – for example to a German hunter recently, to kill one of Africa’s largest elephants just for the sheer sport of it. During the decade up to 2013, nearly 27 000 hunting trophies originating from Africa and America were imported into Europe – and that is a conservative estimate.  The EU is the world’s biggest aid donor, which gives us leverage in Africa and elsewhere to stop the issuing of permits that allow trophy hunting to continue. I urge the Commission and Member States to take up a leadership role in CITES and to involve this House in its decision—making to put pressure on states that issue permits for trophy hunting and also to restrict all trophy imports.

It is also – in the face of the urgent solidarity that Europe offers to migrants and refugees – that we are aware that Europe is incapable of accepting, integrating and meeting the expectations of all those who see Europe as a promised land. Therefore, Europe must establish an effective external border with Turkey in the Mediterranean as soon as possible. We must establish this border primarily for the sake of the security and future of our continent. The Europeans have not given anyone a mandate to fully open the border.
