Kõigepealt lubage mul öelda, kui uhke tunne mul on täna siin Euroopa Parlamendis esindada Euroopa Liidu Nõukogu ja Eesti eesistujat. Ma loodan väga heale koostööle Euroopa Parlamendiga ja tänan teid selle eest, kuidas Eesti eesistumist ja mind on siin majas juba vastu võetud.  Mr President, I am grateful for your invitation to discuss the G20 summit, which Germany will host from Friday in Hamburg. At the summit, G20 leaders, including Presidents Tusk and Juncker, will be faced with intense discussions on various topics of global importance. The international political environment is currently particularly charged and global cooperation can no longer be taken for granted. In this context, the mission of European leaders is clear. The G20 is central to this effort since it is – as G20 leaders stated in Pittsburgh in 2009 – the premier forum for international economic cooperation. It is also essential to give a clear signal that securing balanced and inclusive growth remains a top priority. Even if the global economy is showing positive momentum, political uncertainty surrounding the outlook is still high. Allow me to expand on a selection of issues which I think will take centre stage in Hamburg. I will refer to trade, climate, migration, digitalisation and countering terrorism. It should be the EU’s priority to send a strong signal to the G20 of our commitment to open trade and multilateralism. As recalled by the June European Council, the EU will pursue a robust trade policy, upholding an open and rule—based multilateral trading system with a central role for the WTO. The EU will also keep markets open and fight protectionism, firm in the belief that trade contributes to creating wealth and jobs. The EU will therefore actively promote an ambitious free-trade agenda on the global stage. In this respect, reaching a political agreement on the EU—Japan trade deal ahead of the G20 meeting would send a strong signal against protectionism. We need to improve the daily lives of citizens by ensuring that the benefits of globalisation are more widely shared. As was stressed by the June European Council, we need to foster a truly level playing field, while remaining vigilant concerning the respect and promotion of key standards, including social, environmental, health and consumer standards, which are central to the European way of life. Beyond that, we must also be able to better communicate the actual benefits of trade to the wider public. On climate change, we are all aware that the global community needs to act urgently and move forward with the implementation of the Paris Agreement. The unilateral decision by the United States administration to withdraw from the Paris Agreement is therefore a highly regrettable step. We already discussed this issue here in Parliament during the June session. As you are aware, the EU’s commitment to fully implementing the Paris Agreement was strongly reaffirmed by the June European Council. The agreement remains a cornerstone of global efforts to effectively tackle climate change, and it cannot be renegotiated. I can only further confirm that the Council under the Estonian Presidency will continue in its commitment to ambitious global action against climate change and support the global ownership of the Paris Agreement. The EU and its Member States are playing their full part in implementing the Agreement, both through the development of our domestic policies and in keeping with our commitment to global solidarity. We will have to minimise the effects of the US decision on the effectiveness and credibility of the climate framework. The Presidency believes that we should continue our dialogue and engagement with the US. At the same time, we can also be encouraged by strong statements of commitment, as well as pledges by local governments, businesses, cities, communities and other non-state actors in America. These developments underscore the importance of the action agenda as a platform to connect the different non-state actors. Its importance is expected to grow in the coming years, boosting the political profile and momentum for climate action. My third point is on migration. Dealing with the migration crisis has been at the core of the political debate in the EU, including here in the Parliament, and it is all the more pertinent today in the light of the news from the central Mediterranean and Italy. We naturally tend to focus on the migration crisis in our part of the world, but migration is not a European phenomenon. Nor is managing it solely a European responsibility. It is rather a global responsibility, requiring collective solutions in full respect for our obligations under international law. In this regard, the G20 is launching the G20 Africa partnership, which should foster sustainable and inclusive economic growth and development. It will contribute to creating decent employment, particularly for women and young people, thus addressing poverty and the root causes of migration. This also ties in closely with the ongoing legislative work in the EU on the external investment plan, including the European fund for sustainable development and the European Investment Bank’s external lending mandate. We are also committed to taking an active part in the follow-up to the UN summit on addressing large movements of refugees and migration, held in September last year. The EU intends to play a prominent role in the process leading to the establishment in 2018 of UN global compacts on migration and refugees. We would ask all G20 members to engage as well. Digitalisation is a key priority for the Estonian Presidency and, therefore, we welcome the inclusion of this topic at the G20 summit. Information and communications technology is no longer a specific sector. It is the backbone of all modern innovative economic systems. Therefore, we need to breach digital gaps based on, inter alia, age, geography, gender and income. However, technological progress also involves challenges to our security and democracy, which we expect to be reflected by the G20. These challenges highlight the need to strengthen consumer protection, transparency and security in the use of information and communication technology. Last but not least, the EU has been at the global forefront of the fight against terrorism financing. Recently an agreement on the revision of the Fourth Anti—Money Laundering Agreement was reached. Countering terrorism requires holistic action, including improved cooperation and preventing violent extremism conducive to terrorism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. –Mr President, in the coming days, the G20 leaders will meet in Hamburg. It will be an important moment: there will be many new faces around the table, and there are many challenges to address. The agenda is more far-reaching than for previous meetings, showing that this format has the potential to look far beyond its initial economic focus. Economy and trade will certainly feature large, but also the fight against terrorism, as well sustainable development, climate change and energy, migration, Africa, health, digitalisation, employment and women’s empowerment. For the EU, the G20 summit is an opportunity to highlight the positive contribution we are currently making to global growth, our vision for fair globalisation, set out in the Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation, and our consistent leadership across multiple areas of the global agenda. Examples include our commitment to the Paris Agreement, progress on our progressive, values-based trade agenda, and our engagement with developing countries through the European Fund for Sustainable Development on which the House will vote this week. In these times of turmoil, it is also the moment to show our unwavering commitment to global multilateral governance and responsible international political dialogue, aimed at delivering in the interest of people all over the world. Against a background of rising ultra-nationalist politics, posing a risk to global economic growth and the rules-based global order, the G20 Hamburg summit has the motto ‘Shaping an interconnected world’, to underline the necessity of multilateral cooperation for prosperity, security and freedom. Let me briefly run you through the main messages that we as the EU want to give. On the economy, we will highlight the positive contribution the EU is making to the global economy. The EU is growing at nearly 2% this year and next year. The European investment plan is well on track, having led to more than EUR 200 billion in additional and sustainable investments. We are getting our mojo back! On climate and energy, we will reaffirm our strong commitment to the Paris Agreement, clean energy transition and support for the poor and vulnerable in the fight against climate change, and we will maintain cohesion within the G19 despite the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement. We would, of course, welcome it if the US would reconsider its decision, but let me be very clear: the deal cannot be renegotiated. On trade, we will present our vision for harnessing globalisation instead of turning inward and resorting to protectionism, because we all agree that there is no ‘protect’ in protectionism, but there is isolation in isolationism. We will demonstrate that the EU will stand up for free and fair trade and for the multilateral trading system as a whole, and we will showcase the progress we are making on our progressive trade agenda, with the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement and now the EU-Japan trade deal. And, because trade should be fair, we are looking for a strong signal from China as to its full cooperation within the Global Forum on Steel Access Capacity. On taxation, we will maintain momentum for the fight against tax evasion and avoidance. Next steps will include defensive measures against non-cooperative tax jurisdictions and increased efforts to promote the availability, and international exchange, of information on beneficial ownership of legal persons and legal arrangements. On migration: this is a challenge that is going to be with us for quite some time to come – for decades. We must preserve a commitment to a comprehensive global response to tackling irregular migration and forced displacement, including support for the UN Global Compact on refugees and on regular, safe, orderly migration, and we must build support for a strengthened approach to break the business model of migrant smuggling. This is what we must do on the global stage but let me add one thing: it would already make a world of difference in Europe if every single Member State would live up to its commitments to show solidarity with those of our Member States most affected by this challenge. We cannot leave Italy alone with this. Everybody should play their part.  (Applause) We have shown in the past that if we stick together and find solutions that everybody shares we can reach results. Certainly the situation in Greece is not yet where we want it to be. There is still a lot to do, but if you look back at 2015 and then look at the situation now, you will see that much has also improved. There is an incredible level of solidarity with refugees and migrants in Greece and in Italy. But the rest of Europe cannot simply count on the solidarity of the people in Greece and Italy, because the people there also have their limits, and we need to show that the rest of Europe understands this and is playing its part in helping to resolve this crisis. (Applause) On terrorism, we need agreement on an action plan to advance the fight against terrorism. We will not win the battle against terrorist financing and the spread of radicalisation online if we do not work with our international partners on this. On Africa: we will support close partnership with Africa to foster sustainable growth and job creation. Just imagine if we do not do this: our refugee problem in the future will then be so much worse than it already is today. The only sustainable solution is growth and more optimism in Africa, so that people understand it is in their interest to stay in Africa and to develop their own countries, instead of going to Europe. Lastly, I welcome the fact that the German G20 Presidency has put strong emphasis on stakeholder involvement. All the groups concerned –business, labour, civil science, the think tanks, women and youth – have been active and have put forward recommendations. We are in a post-paternalistic society and we can no longer prescribe, from politics or governance, what should be done: we need to include global brain power to make sure that we find the right solutions. That is how globalisation will be shaped in the interest of humanity as a whole, because, at the end of the day, everything we do here in the European Parliament and in the Commission is at the service of citizens, their freedoms and their ability to pursue their hopes and dreams.

That is the lesson that I would like to learn again from the moving act of mourning that took place here in our house last Saturday. It was really unique for me to be reminded of Helmut Kohl's message again: Keep talking, try to develop solutions together. That's why I think it's good that the G20 summit is taking place.

How do we ensure fair globalisation? Globalisation brings a lot of benefits to us but also a lot of challenges to our societies, and the G20 summit in Hamburg is an opportunity for the EU to lead on how to create fairer globalisation in which everyone benefits. Many important topics have been mentioned already by the speakers here on climate change, on sustainable development goals, on the migration crisis and so on, and it is important that we in the European Union take the lead on all these issues. I also want to say that globalisation issues have troubled a lot of countries and citizens alike. Let me be clear and honest: when it comes to globalisation, the free and unregulated market has, to some extent, failed us. It has worked extremely well for multinational corporations and already-wealthy individuals, but for far too many ordinary workers – like the steel workers in France and the UK or the slaughterhouse workers in Denmark and Germany, to take examples – globalisation has also brought unfair competition, negative wage pressure, job insecurity and, in many cases, unemployment. So at the same time as enormous wealth has been created, it has not yet been fairly shared: that is clear. Why are the world’s eight richest people now wealthier? They are now wealthier than half of the world’s population. Real wages for middle-income families have stagnated in many societies, including in various parts of Europe, and in many EU countries real wages have actually shrunk. This is an outrage and we need to do something about it. This is a result of market liberalism run amok, and we need to change course. Showing European leadership on harnessing globalisation means ensuring that European values, principles and standards shape globalisation, and not vice-versa. For the Socialist and Democrats, a key principle is global tax justice. It was also mentioned by the Commission and I was glad to hear that. We are calling for global tax justice to be a top priority at the G20 summit too. We want the EU to take the lead on concrete new initiatives: we need a global asset register so that taxable assets can be traced and recovered; we need a global register of beneficial ownership so that tax fraud can be revealed; we also need to coordinate efforts to stop, punish and prevent tax havens – and this too was mentioned by the Commission. I think it is important we take the lead in that fight. We also need to ensure that corporate income tax is fair. This is an opportunity for the EU. Let us take the lead on all of these issues! We look forward to the G20 Summit.

These are turbulent times. We face challenges which spread far beyond the borders of the European Union. We face global challenges which connect us all and require a global response. We face a humanitarian crisis, conflict at our doorstep and a barely recovering economy. This is why we need the Summit to be fruitful. Talk is cheap, and our electorate wants to see results. Unfortunately, leader summits have become better known for updating the family photo than for plotting a strategic course for the next twelve months. Leaders need to start looking at what they can realistically achieve at a global level in the next few months, and whilst the EU is willing to take on more and more responsibility on the world stage, the EU cannot start believing that it can solve every crisis by itself. We do not need an EU which thinks that just one policy can solve the migration crisis, but an EU which works with the UN, NATO, and the G20 to end the funding of terrorism and to punish the barbaric practice of human trafficking. The EU needs to sit at the table and commit to making the EU as global-facing and pro-free trade as possible. The EU needs to champion less regulation and lower taxes, not more red tape and bureaucracy. We need an EU which lives up to its obligations to protect the environment without stifling business, because it is jobs and growth which draw people out of poverty and prevent unsustainable economic migration. It is jobs and growth which bring countries closer together and gives people more self-confidence and respect.

Thank you, Mr Timmermans, for your speech, and I was very glad to hear you used the word ‘challenge’, and not ‘crisis’, when you were speaking of migration because we talk a lot about ‘the migration crisis’, whereas what is really going on here is that there is a political and a moral crisis. The Estonian Presidency is absolutely right in saying that migration management is a global responsibility, and therefore it is to be welcomed that the German Presidency wants to put this firmly on the agenda of the G20, making it a global issue. At the same time, it is also a European responsibility and, as the Commissioner set out very clearly, Member States are not living up to their responsibility. They are abandoning Italy and they are abandoning Greece. I am reminded of a statement made by the Dutch Prime Minister at the time of a previous mass influx of migrants into Italy, when a journalist asked the Prime Minister ‘Isn’t it sad for Italy that, because of its geographical location, it has to take in all the refugees?’, and the Prime Minister said ‘Well, tough luck for Italy.’ That has been the attitude of Europe, and it is a shame. We are the most prosperous continent in the world. If we cannot manage this migration influx, then who can? We have to start assuming our responsibility. I am glad to see that the Commission has taken action: it has put forward a kind of action plan for Italy. But, first of all, the focus is now very much on what NGOs are doing, and I think we should stop the blame game. You can never blame NGOs for saving people’s lives. (Applause) Secondly, I wonder why we are not using the legal instruments at our disposal, such as the Temporary Protection Mechanism. We have it: why is it not being used? It can be adopted in the Council by a qualified majority vote. Thirdly, when will we stop using European money to fund dictators and failed regimes?

Only the UN has legitimacy. ”This quote does not come from me, but from the great French diplomat, resistance fighter and author of the UN Declaration of Human Rights, Stéphane Hessel. Therefore Hamburg will be outraged. The G20 summit will meet in my hometown, the most beautiful city in Germany. Nevertheless, many will leave the city when the fine gentlemen Trump or Erdoğan visit us. Hamburg, the gateway to the world, will be like a restricted area so that demonstrators do not harass the leaders. We don't like curfew in Hamburg, as the world-famous Reeperbahn proves every night. Of course, heads of state should talk to each other, especially in times of global crises. You don't have to do that in the Rocky Mountains either. But the G20 are negotiating the fate of the world. These debates therefore belong before the United Nations in New York. Then Mr. Trump would not have that far from the golf course either. The G20, which accounts for 80 percent of the world's national product, come together to discuss important issues: trade, migration, tax dumping, climate change, security and terrorism. Tax evaders are the real expensive refugees. Up to $ 30 trillion is stashed away in tax havens. According to Oxfam, around eight people now own as much as half the world's population. This is a sick development with all due respect. We have not only needed public investment in housing, schools, universities or hospitals since the refugee crisis. But the negotiation - also here in the EU - on a black list of tax havens is turning into diplomatic horse-trading. We finally need sources and penalty taxes on financial flows in tax havens, inside and outside the EU. The wars in the Middle East - from Afghanistan to Iraq, Libya or Syria - have created chaos, state collapse, terror and displacement. Not only Bombs and free trade agreements - as the EU is now aiming for with Japan after TTIP and CETA - have created major economic turmoil in Africa. The arms exports and the chumbling with terror godfathers like Saudi Arabia or the new EU bouncer - Erdoğan - made the Islamic State great. But the G20 are now discussing military defense against refugees and other lazy deals such as with Turkey, for example in Libya or Egypt.

Simone Veil was a fighter for Europe, because she had survived the worst that Europe could produce, but she never reduced Europe to a commemoration. She always considered that Europe was a project of civilization for every woman, for every man, for us Europeans, and for the rest of the world. Simone Veil, today, would she be satisfied with a European project which would be a project for the unhindered circulation of goods, services and investments, which would put our legislation, our environmental and social regulations and our democratic sovereignty within reach? cannon of old world multinational corporations, oil, nuclear and endocrine disruptors? What would Simone Veil say when she saw the walls, barbed wire and camps that lock up people who are also people who survive? Today, Europe is alone against Trump, Putin, Erdoğan and Xi Jinping, but only it can carry a project of cooperation on an international scale, a project of solidarity and a project of protection of the commons. For this to happen, it must change its footing and that at the G20, it must not be there to promote free trade agreements which produce all the chaos in the world and which fuel a development model twice the size of the planet, twice as big in predation and twice as big in pollution. If there is one element that Europe must bring to the G20, in particular, it is this question of the climate and, to raise this question, it is not enough to say that we will respect the Paris Agreement: Europe is not on the trajectory of the Paris agreement in terms of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions. So let's go with a lot more ambition strong.Let's go ahead and say that the G20 promise to end public subsidies to fossil fuels must be implemented immediately.This is your responsibility, this is our responsibility, including if we want to be sincere and faithful to the tribute paid to Simone Veil.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Raymond FINCH", "mepid": "124941", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, the G20 meeting gives the EU an opportunity to speak to the major economies of the world and to find out what their perception of the post-Brexit landscape will be.

You, as well as every single person in this room, know perfectly well that those people would not want to stay in Hungary because they want a better life. They would like to move on to richer countries like Germany, Austria, Sweden, and so on. Mr Timmermans, how can we hold them back? What is the order, so to say, in this respect? We all know very well that we cannot put these people into a closed institution; they have the right to freedom of movement. I know we should integrate them. This will probably be the answer, but this is the wrong answer, Mr Timmermans and dear colleagues, because they would not like to be integrated in Hungary, they would like to move on the next day to richer countries.  So you must have a strategy on that, because your whole strategy about the treatment of the migrant crisis is based on the idea of solidarity among Member States and forcing all Member States, including my country Hungary, to receive migrants.

Yes, there is a lot of bad news globally - Angelika Niebler mentioned a few - and that is why it is all the more important that we use all opportunities to re-establish global governance. Especially in view of the behavior of some countries that say “my country first” or “my America first”, we as Europeans have to counter this: “people first”. That must be the motto for global governance - to set up global structures in the interests of the people. And I do believe that the EU must set some priorities here. We heard: Africa must be a priority. No question about it, we have to develop a sustainable development strategy for Africa so that people at home have a perspective and can make their life chances a reality there. Investing and good governance for Africa is - in my view - a priority for the EU. Then of course it's also about empowering women. When the ILO speaks of the forgotten billion, the third billion forgotten people, it means women who are unable to develop their skills - empowering women, the second priority. The third priority: fair trade, of course, and not just freer, away from protectionism. When the ILO says that the 780 million people who also produce products for us in global value chains do not have enough income to finance their own lives - then something is wrong! We have to have fair conditions for global value chains, we have to strengthen workers' rights. Only then is trade not only free but also fair, and that must be the third priority.

It's really outrageous that we're back there. I say this because many intervene. I certainly want to support that too. But I also say it because we now know that we are not going to solve the migration crisis by taking short-term measures, but effectively by creating a connecting world. One of the first and most important things we need to do in the G-20 is to make sure that there can be, should be, some kind of united position on how to apply the Paris climate agreement. Because if we don't tackle the climate, then these are the appetizers, the problems surrounding migration today will be the appetizers of tomorrow and those problems will continue to grow. Yesterday at the Commission's work program I stressed very much that the first thing we need to do is lead by example ourselves and I also look at my colleagues in the hemisphere. We are working hard on a number of dossiers such as the clean energy package. Let us make that as ambitious as possible, that is our first responsibility. Second, the United States.

For many long-term policies that we are agreeing on in the G20, if there is a serious crisis, whether on the Korean peninsula or the Arabian peninsula, all these reinforcements will be immediately called into question and here Europe is able to build bridges between the United States, China and Russia, between the United States, Iran and Saudi Arabia, and we must not renounce that role. Two words later for the G20's own agenda. The first to say that the European Union - and here we do not need the G20 - cannot leave Italy, Greece, including Spain, alone on this issue of refugees. It is everyone's responsibility: from the north, east, south and west of Europe.

First, on the refugee crisis and our cooperation with the Italian authorities on a code of conduct. There is no one at the Commission who accuses NGOs of anything. I have stated very clearly yesterday in the press conference that the intentions of the NGOs are noble and good. What they are trying to do is save people from drowning in the Mediterranean. Nobody contests that. The only thing I have said very clearly yesterday is that a code of conduct could be helpful to avoid accidents at sea, to avoid misunderstandings, to make sure that the Libyan coast guard, once it is at the level needed, can do its job in Libyan territorial waters. That is the intention of our cooperation with the Italian authorities. I want to be crystal clear about that. To the honourable Member, Ms Gardini, I would say this: I understand your criticism of the Commission and of what we are doing, but I think we are in this fight together. We are doing our best to encourage Member States to do what they have promised and to join with extra efforts to make this situation in Italy more bearable on all of us. But I would also ask her and other colleagues here in Parliament: could they please help us in talking to the prime ministers who are part of your political families, and tell them also they should take the responsibility? I understand – Ms in ‘t Veld said very clearly – she criticised the prime minister from her political family. Great. But talk to the prime ministers in your political family and convince them to do what needs to be done, and then we can all do the same job together instead of criticising each other. We are on the same line, the Commission and the European Parliament. Let’s join efforts and convince the leaders of our nations, who are all part of one of mainly three political families in this House, to make sure that they do their bit. I believe if we do that together, we will get results fairly quickly. Now, just a remark about Brexit. I know that Mr Finch operates under the Farage doctrine here in the European Parliament, which is to make outrageous statements and then run away before anybody can react. But still, I want to use the opportunity to react. I think we are all under an economic, political and above all moral obligation to do the least harm possible in this Brexit process. I think nobody disputes that position and attitude of the Commission, of the Member States and, I would argue also, of Her Majesty’s government in London. But to go from there and to say that the whole of the European Union is going to suffer terribly in the G20 because of Brexit is a bit rich, frankly. And Mr Finch, just so you know, I am a great admirer of British culture and I love the UK deeply, whether they are in the EU or not, but Mr Finch really reminds me of a character created by John Cleese in Monty Python’s The Holy Grail. It is the Black Knight, who, after being defeated terribly and all his limbs cut off, says to his opponent: ‘Let’s call it a draw’. What I would like to say to Ms Morvai, who has developed a new practice of asking questions to me every time I am here – and credit to her, she waits to hear the answer – I wanted to say this. She asked me precisely the question about refugees. But let me turn this around one moment. What would have happened if, in 1956 the Swedish Prime Minister, the Danish Prime Minister, the German Chancellor, the Dutch Prime Minister, the Belgian Prime Minister, the Luxembourgish Prime Minister, had said: ‘These Hungarians, these people culturally don’t belong here. These people will change our culture in a way that we cannot accept.’ What would have happened in 1956 if that had been done? I am proud of the European legacy where, when people are persecuted by an inhuman Communist regime such as the regime at the time in Hungary, they find safe refuge in other European countries – and the Hungarian communities across Europe have made an incredible contribution to our societies and have reached the highest level of all these societies in the first, second and third generation. That would be my answer to you, Ms Morvai. And to Ms Atkinson, I really would like to say: how can you develop this profound admiration for President Putin on the basis of national sovereignty? Who in Europe has had more disregard of national sovereignty than President Putin, who occupies part of another sovereign nation? Who has had less disregard for this? How can you admire a man and his politics based on your analysis of national sovereignty? It is completely beyond me. Finally, if you will allow me, I will answer Mr de Graaff in the same language that he and I share. Mijnheer De Graaff heeft het over de patriottische lente die door zijn politieke leider in Nederland voortdurend werd verkondigd. Mijnheer De Graaff vertegenwoordigt een politieke beweging die in het land dat ik het beste ken, succes heeft geboekt bij een deel van het electoraat dat zich in de steek gelaten voelt door de traditionele partijen, zoals ook mijn eigen partij. Als mensen naar je partij toe komen, geeft je dat ook een grote verantwoordelijkheid om iets te doen aan de zorgen die ertoe leiden dat mensen denken dat je een oplossing hebt. Maar de beweging van de heer De Graaff laat mensen alleen maar in de steek, door alleen maar woede te voeden, door alleen maar boosheid op tafel te leggen, door nooit eens een keer met een constructieve oplossing te komen, door nooit te proberen onderdeel van de oplossing te zijn, alleen maar proberen het probleem op te kloppen en groter te maken en ik zeg tegen de heer De Graaff – en hiermee wil ik eindigen – ik zie inderdaad een patriottische lente in Europa.  Het is een Europese patriottische lente die in Bratislava werd getoond door de Europese leiders toen ze samen een toekomst uitstippelden die we samen gaan vormgeven; die in Rome werd getoond door de Europese leiders toen ze aangaven samen de toekomst te willen aangeven; die op de G-20-top zal worden getoond door Europese leiders als ze aangeven dat de toekomst van de wereld, het welzijn van de Europeanen, alleen maar op duurzame manier kan worden gerealiseerd als Europeanen dat sámen doen, niet op basis van een vals idee van nationale soevereiniteit tegen mekaar, niet door neer te kijken op andere Europeanen of minderheden in de eigen samenleving, maar door iedereen de kracht te geven om samen een betere wereld te vormen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 41, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Alexander Graf LAMBSDORFF", "mepid": "28242", "text": "  Thank you, First Vice-President, and thank you also for reminding us of John Cleese and his contributions to our common European culture.

Unfortunately, the damage caused by the four-decade rupture has not yet been fully remedied. That is why the analogy that the few thousand '56 Hungarian refugees are the same as the mass influx of refugees from the African and Asian continents into the EU today is unfortunate. Following the events of '56, some of those who still believed in freedom and democracy left Hungary in the direction of a better life, which was previously valid in their homeland as well. The ’56s knew why and where they were going, which is not clear in the present case. It is not fair to separate the eastern and western parts of the EU with such non-truthful statements. It does not serve unity, it does not even lead to a solution.

Juulis 1979 pidas esimese kõne esimese otsevalitud Euroopa Parlamendi ees Louise Weiss, kelle järgi see maja on oma nime saanud. Oma kõnes viitas Weiss, tollal 89-aastane „Euroopa Vanaema“, Hermann Keyserlingi loomingule. Keyserling oli Eestis sündinud filosoof, kes juba 20. sajandi alguses omas visiooni ühtsest Euroopast. Euroopast, kus riigid töötavad koos, aga säilitavad oma unikaalsuse. Euroopast, mis on tugev just oma mitmekesisuse tõttu. Samal istungil presidendina oma esimese kõne pidanud Simone Veil (keda just neil hetkil Pariisis viimasele teekonnale saadetakse) rõhutas, et ainult Euroopa dimensiooni kaudu on võimalik leida lahendus kolmele suurele väljakutsele: rahule, vabadusele ja heaolule. See on endiselt nii. 38 aastat hiljem on mul au seista siin, et esitleda Eesti Euroopa Liidu Nõukogu esimese eesistumise prioriteete. Keyserlingi ja Weissi ajaga võrreldes on palju muutunud, kuid idee Euroopa rahvaste liidust on püsima jäänud. The European Union is not only an idea. For 500 million people in the EU, it is their daily reality. Europeans want and deserve a union that is strong and decisive and that delivers. To achieve that, we must ensure that every voice is heard and balance the different traditions, interests and opinions in Europe, fairly. This is why the overarching theme of our Presidency is Unity through Balance.  First, before I turn to our plans, I acknowledge that no Presidency can succeed, alone. We will work very closely with you, honourable Members of the European Parliament, to make sure that citizens are at the heart of everything we do. We need your wisdom and input on every topic on our agenda. We are very grateful to Malta for their excellent work paving the way for us and our trio partners – Bulgaria and Austria. In Bratislava, Malta and Rome, we had a frank and honest discussion about where we stand and what we need to do to weather the storms ahead and emerge stronger.  It is our shared agenda, with the honourable Parliament, to find concrete answers to our citizens’ most pressing concerns – unemployment, security and immigration – and to bring Europe closer to our citizens. For the Estonian Council Presidency, our key aim is to move forward with the EU’s positive agenda The four priorities that we will focus on over the next six months reflect these discussions and are guided by the spirit of the Rome Declaration. They include an open and innovative European economy, an inclusive and sustainable Europe, a safe and secure Europe and, of course, a digital Europe with the free movement of data. Our priority of an open and innovative European economy, a strong and competitive European economy, supports growth and employment. Of course, that will make our plans and vision in every other policy area possible. The Single Market is one of the greatest assets of the EU, and the free movement of goods, services, people and capital benefits us all. However, the Single Market is not complete. Some of its potential is still untapped.  Our Presidency is prioritising the creation of an innovative, European social market economy that is open to changes, opportunities, free and fair trade and original ideas. For companies to succeed, the business environment must be transparent, simple and free of red tape. We are focused on ensuring a stable banking sector and taking forward the Services Package, and we stand ready to reform EU company law.  Equally, a smarter, cleaner and more cost-effective energy system with an enhanced role for the consumer is an important part of a competitive European economy, and one that we will aim for.  Our next priority is an Inclusive and Sustainable Europe. Of course, a strong economy must be based on the core European values of inclusivity and sustainability. The EU is not just for the few, or for the here and now. We want to ensure that every European citizen can continue to enjoy a Europe that is beautiful, sustainable, free, prosperous and safe.  One of the biggest challenges for this generation of politicians is technological transformation. It is one that I am confident we can shape. Because of our changing society and the influence of technology, the very nature of work is changing. Remote working in a digital economy means an employer and an employee may never actually meet in person. Along with robotisation and artificial intelligence, it represents the ‘fourth industrial revolution’. In response, we need to adapt our social security systems and respond to changes in the economic environment. Skills must meet the needs of future jobs, whether it be building self-driving cars or designing virtual reality experiences.  During our Presidency, we will focus on ways in which the EU can offer equal opportunities and conditions for people, both in their own Member State and also when working and living in another.  Equally, we owe it to our future generations and we owe it to our planet to fulfil our commitment to the Paris Agreement and ensure that sustainability is a key feature of all European policies. Despite the United States withdrawing from the Agreement, we will not change our own commitment.   Our next priority is a safe and secure Europe. Born from the destruction of two bloody world wars, Europe came together, united. It is our utmost duty to keep Europe safe and secure. We cannot fail in that. Let me underline this to the House. In the 21st century, we must not accept aggression against a European country or the illegal annexation and occupation of part of its territory. Were it not for the 1983 European Parliament resolution on Soviet-occupied Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, perhaps I would not be standing in front of you today.  I remember what it means to live inside closed borders when the Berlin Wall, the Iron Curtain, divided Europe. We were not allowed to visit foreign countries. Even Estonian islands were highly guarded border-zones that could be visited only with a special permit. I remember my parents watching Finnish television and listening to the Radio Free Europe – the only access to the free world.  I know what it means to wish for freedom and democracy. I believe that it is not impossible that one day in the future, a Ukrainian President may stand in front of this house in the same role as I am today. It is clear that the European Union must assume greater responsibility for security in and around Europe. No single country is able to stand up to the threats we face, or solve these challenges, alone. The Global Strategy, the EU-NATO joint declaration and the debate on the future of defence rightly set out a high ambition. In order to keep those ambitious promises and deliver results, we need to spend more and we need to spend better on defence. That means joint development of the necessary capabilities.  At the same time, we need to make full use of the existing and new mechanisms, such as the Battlegroups, Permanent Structured Cooperation and the European Defence Fund. Practice makes perfect, so we must regularly carry out coordinated crisis-management exercises. The EU has a vast toolbox ranging from industry, to cyber defence, from strategic communication to Battlegroups.  The EU’s external borders need better protection and tighter control over the movement of both irregular migrants and illicit goods. Law enforcement needs a targeted toolbox for cooperation and information sharing.  Sadly, many of the recent terror attacks have proven that often the threats to our safety are not caused by shortcomings on the ground, but by the lack of information sharing. Therefore, we must continue to create modern IT solutions for the rapid exchange of information. We must improve the interoperability of information systems and the quality of data exchange. There cannot be known ‘unknowns’, when peoples’ lives are at stake.  The ongoing migration-crisis remains the most urgent challenge that we have seen for decades. It is our responsibility, not only as Europeans but as human beings, to assist those seeking refuge in Europe from the tragedy of the Syrian war. Once again, no one Member State can resolve the crisis on their own. We can only keep Europe safe if we act together, in the spirit of solidarity and responsibility.  The EU cannot only look inwards. We must look outwards, actively assisting countries in our neighborhood, both in the south as well as the east. We must reconfirm our political commitment to the Eastern Partnership in order to better respond to the ambitions of all the partners.  In addition to the Eastern Partnership Summit, we will also contribute to the preparations of the EU-Latin American and Caribbean States Summit and the EU-Africa Summit. In summary, our citizens expect safety and security, and we must deliver it together and without hesitation. Next, our priority of creating a digital Europe and the free movement of data. In Estonia, we think of the free movement of data as the fifth freedom of the EU. Therefore, we will start a political debate in Europe on this essential freedom. The digital revolution is at the core of every challenge and opportunity that Europe faces today. Together with our Trio partners, Bulgaria and Austria, we are committed to delivering a Digital Single Market in 2018. But we must also look further afield, which is why we have a digital dimension to almost every aspect of our Presidency programme, from fisheries to space, and the use of data – the raw material of the digital society.  The development of cross-border services and e-commerce has tangible benefits for EU citizens. Buying goods or services online, watching your favourite domestic TV-show, or using e-prescriptions in another European country should be possible and easy. Concluding the current negotiations on geoblocking, audiovisual media services and taking forward the reform of copyright will help get us there.  A critical aspect of a functioning digital society is trust. Europe should be a safe place where rules respecting privacy, data protection and our digital identity are vital. As seen from the recent global cyber-attacks, we need to up our game to keep Europe safe. To support this digital society, Europe requires fast, seamless, always-on and always-available connectivity. Europe needs to be among the pioneers in rolling out 5G and developing new connected products and services. Updating the telecommunications regulatory framework will contribute to these goals. A data driven economy and the fourth industrial revolution will also need a Digital Government.  Every person in Europe should be able to interact with the government with ease and without worry. During our Presidency, we will encourage the use of IT solutions in daily life, including our health, justice, and financial systems. Trust me on this point, once you have filled your tax declaration in just three minutes while sitting by the river on a nice Sunday, you will never want to go back to paperwork. In the Estonian Government, we save a stack of papers as high as the Eiffel Tower each month – that means twelve Eiffel Towers per year! In September, I look forward to welcoming the Heads of States, governments and institutions to the Digital Summit in Tallinn to discuss these very issues and opportunities.  There is one more topic that I would like to address before I conclude – Brexit. We are sad to see the UK withdraw from the EU. It is a loss for our country, for the European Union and for the United Kingdom. I hope that the United Kingdom will remain a close friend. The negotiations need to be conducted in a constructive spirit, tackling first the citizens’ rights, the financial settlement and the border in Ireland.   However, the Presidency’s task is also to make sure that EU27 continues to work and continues to deliver for our future. We will not let Brexit negotiations dominate our work or prevent us from achieving results. In Conclusion, Honourable Members of the Parliament, I hope that our Presidency will be remembered as one that allowed Europe to put the crises behind us and once again look optimistically towards our future. In the words of the great Irish poet Seamus Heaney, this could be a ‘once in a lifetime’ moment when hope and history rhyme.  My own country and people have been very lucky. Our hope and history have rhymed twice in less than a century so, in a way, it makes us experts on ‘seizing the day.’ I am sure we are not alone in feeling that change is in the air. Europe needs to be redefined for every generation, to adapt and to inspire. Helmut Kohl was one of the key architects of Europe. We sent him on his last journey from this very room only a few days ago. He said: ‘the visionaries of yesterday are the realists of today’.  I believe that things we never thought possible are happening, right before our eyes. So, there is no excuse for not acting, there is no excuse for thinking small. We will turn tomorrow’s reality into the one we want. Today, it is up to us to begin creating that vision, creating that reality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 51, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  President Ratas, thank you for a very comprehensive and ambitious programme that we in Parliament certainly look forward to working on with you, and if I may say, the fine choice of poet that you quoted.

This moment comes after a long wait for a country that joined the European Union some 13 years ago, but good things come to those who wait, and Europe has many good things to look forward to over the course of the next six months. Along with President Juncker and my fellow Commissioners, I was in Tallinn last week and saw first hand how well-prepared the Presidency team is. Knowing how the Estonian civil service works, I never doubted this for a moment. This is also reflected in the programme of the Estonian Presidency, which is fully in line with the joint declaration which the Presidents of the three institutions signed at the end of last year. Both go to the heart of the issues that matter the most for Europeans. The timing of the Estonian Presidency could not be better. I say that because it comes at a time when we need to make progress on making the digital part of Europe’s DNA. The next six months are crucial for making our economy digital. Since this Commission came into office, we have made some real progress towards completing the digital single market, having made 35 proposals since November 2014. Together with the upcoming Bulgarian and Austrian Presidencies, Estonia has set the goal of reaching agreement in all of them by the end of next year. That will be important if we are to benefit from the EUR 415 billion that completing the digital single market could unlock. I am delighted that the Presidency has highlighted 5G coverage as a priority area. We want 5G to be commercially available in at least one major city of each EU Member State by 2020, as it will be in Tallinn by next year. But in the long term, all urban areas, as well as major roads and railways across Europe, should have uninterrupted 5G coverage. Achieving that could bring EUR 146 billion worth of benefits a year and is likely to create 2.39 million jobs in the European Union. Jobs matter to Europeans, and these are the things that we must focus on. That is why we are also making sure that we are investing in our digital future. There is no shortage of European innovators and entrepreneurs with new and fresh ideas to bring to a thriving digital market. But Europe cannot afford to lose these ideas to other parts of the world because of a lack of opportunities or financing. That is why we are focusing on investments, so start—ups and small businesses can access the financing that they need to scale up and bring their ideas to market. The capital markets union is already helping to make venture capital easier to access, and the Juncker Plan has now mobilised EUR 209 billion across Europe. One of your first achievements will be to secure an agreement on extending the fund so it can unlock at least EUR 0.5 trillion by 2020. But the success of the digital single market will also depend on trust and security. That is why I hope we can learn from Estonia’s experience on cybersecurity. The scale of the risks is significant. By 2020 there will be 50 billion connected devices. Just last year there were 4 000 ransomware attacks per day – a 300% increase compared to the year before. We saw the damage that the data ransomware attack caused to institutions in Europe and elsewhere just last week. That is a very stark reminder and a very clear warning that we cannot take our cybersecurity for granted. With that in mind, we will review the EU cybersecurity strategy with targeted initiatives by September. I know we can rely on your support and expertise on this and on all other broader security issues which I know your Presidency has prioritised. Finding agreement on the European Travel Information and Authorisation System and the Entry—Exit System by the end of the year will be absolutely crucial to ensuring that. Equally, the reform of the Common European Asylum System has taken too long to come to fruition. I sincerely hope that the ‘Unity in Balance’ slogan of your Presidency can be applied here and across the board. There is much work ahead of us over the next six months, and I am glad that the Estonian Presidency will be leading the way. I will not only wish them – or Jüri – good luck, but I also thank you in advance.

I think Estonia has a good chance of qualifying in the first category. As a small country that is not too much burdened by its national interests, Estonia can better play the role of an honest broker to bring the 27 Member State governments more closely together, because this is needed more than ever today. I like the Estonian message, which could be called ‘back to basics’, that the fundamental freedoms need to be fully implemented. As you said, Prime Minister, the single market is not yet complete. I also like the focus on concrete results for EU citizens in terms of better provision for security, safety and quality of life. And similarly, for our neighbours, I am encouraged that Estonia sees the Eastern Partnership as a cross-cutting priority for our foreign and security policy. It should remain a special commitment to help neighbouring nations become part of the same area of rule of law and prosperity. Yesterday evening, Commission Vice-President Timmermans said something which moved me. He said that if Poland and the Baltic States had not joined the European Union in 2004, they would have shared today the fate of Ukraine. Let us now address together the fate of Ukraine and finally agree on a realistic common strategy to counter, without hesitation, Russia’s aggressive policy. The ultimate goal of that policy is not Ukraine, but the weakening, confusing and compromising of the EU itself. The same is true in relation to energy solidarity. I trust Estonia will lend momentum to the completion of the digital single market, boost digital Europe and advance the free movement of data. And, to conclude, I look forward to an active and coordinated approach towards the Mediterranean and Middle Eastern crises, building an efficient border guard system and preparing for an active post-Isis role in Iraq and Syria. I think Estonia has a chance to make Europe cosier and closer to our citizens, and greater for the outside world. Good luck Estonia!

I remember when we started this way to the European Union in 1997, we were poor but we were bold, and we were absolutely sure that the European Union is our destiny: it is our goal and we bring the best of us to that. The same year, we started also the programme ‘Tiger Leap’. It was a programme of digitalisation. We brought computers in all the Estonian schools, and we were sure that digitalisation is our shortcut – shortcut to the future; shortcut to the future where we are now. Here our Prime Minister is standing – the youngest prime minister in Europe – and bringing here both programmes connected with digitalisation, digital revolution really in Europe. What I want to stress is that our experience is showing that digital revolution is total. It is not only market, it is not only technology. In the first place it is new relationships in the whole society: a new type of services, a new type of well-being, a new type of engagement and activity and participation of people, and for that, I suppose, it is very important also to build trust. And as a President said, I suppose that is the most difficult task, because we can tell whatever we like about our good experiences, about digital and so on, but you have to convince the other 27 or 26 that it is that, and very often you will hear what we have heard here – ‘Oh, you are so small and bold, you can do that.’ But we are much bigger; we have bigger risks. We will wait. But we know that Europe cannot wait. Europe cannot wait; Europe needs this; Europe needs to be the most competitive, biggest market in the world for most advanced technology, but also for most advanced society. And I will also stress very much what already was said here. We are living not in a very happy moment for the world. We are looking what is going on around us. Yesterday we saw how Putin and the Chinese leader were embracing each other. We see what is happening in Turkey. We know that really Europe is one of the most important hopes for the world to preserve ideals of democracy, liberal democracy, human rights. These are values which cannot be left just to free flow. We have to protect them, fight for them, and as was said by the Prime Minister, Estonia is like also Latvians, Lithuanians, Poles: we know really the price of freedom. We know the price of the democracy, and for that I am sure that, under our Estonian Presidency, the European Union as a whole will be stronger also in this fight. So I wish you good luck. I wish you strength and wisdom and trust.

Going very quickly through the three priorities of your programme, I would like to start with an open and innovative European economy. It is not an easy time for this task because we know there is a global shift in thinking about free trade and also, even on a single market issue, particularly in several service sectors, we see that it is not really a single market. I wish you a very strong position to succeed in this field and to go in a protectionist direction. In particular in Estonia you have had great experience, since Estonia regained independence, of creating a small, open economy with free trade and a very simple system of how to start doing business. The second issue is security. With the EU having a border with an aggressive neighbour, I think you know very well why you have such priorities as increasing defence expenditure. You have always kept all your promises to NATO. I would point out that they are promises, not obligations. Tunne Kelam spoke of supporting and strengthening relations such as with eastern partnership countries. This is also very important. On EU—NATO relations on the security issue, it may not be well known that Estonia is home to the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. Any EU Member State can get cybersecurity advice and excellence from this centre so it is not necessary to create some kind of European agency for this purpose. Regarding digital matters, I think you will succeed in the next six months with the digital single market. I hope this will also be done with Commissioner Ansip who knows this issue very well. I would just like to add what has already has been said about digital issues, namely that the e-residency programme in Estonia could also perhaps remove some obstacles which would be created if the outcome of the Brexit negotiations goes the wrong way.

To begin with, of course, I would like to wish the Estonian Presidency all the best. You are taking over in a time marked by both populists who question all the common but on the other hand, and this is positive, a very high expectation from the citizens of Europe to find common solutions to common cross-border problems. Citizens say in the latest Eurobarometer, more than 70 percent say, that when it comes to counter-terrorism, climate change and, first and foremost, all policies that must now be focused on building an asylum and migration policy where everyone takes joint responsibility. It is very important for this Union and for our future that we are actually able to create a policy that lasts and where each country has its proportionate share of the shared responsibility. As rapporteur for the Dublin Regulation, I hope, of course, that you will prioritize this and work for a common and really well-functioning policy in this area. It is obviously the case now that the policy we have does not stand and does not stand the test that reality has faced us. We must guard the external borders and all people who pass must be registered. A system where we share responsibility for those who are forced to flee is a European commitment, and I am afraid that very much of our future is at stake if we do not succeed in delivering this time. Citizens expect that it will be legally secure, that protection will be provided to those who need international protection, but that together we will also be able to return those who do not meet the criteria, so that they are not only here in an irregular way without being returned to their countries of origin in an orderly and dignified manner. I think it is important to say that after my meetings now with many of the Estonian Government with the Prime Minister and the other ministers, we can have very high expectations. You will deliver with quality and with a European anda.Let us find solutions for the common good of all.I hope that when you take over now, you will fight for us to find these solutions, and when you leave the presidency, we will be even more of a European Union than now when you take over.Good luck!", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 57, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Dimitrios PAPADIMOULIS", "mepid": "28586", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - Madam President, Mr Ratas, I welcome the first Estonian presidency and I would also like to congratulate you on the important steps of digitization, both in your economy and in your public administration.

They consist in the promotion of an open and innovative economy, and, as required by that, security in daily life as well as significant advances in the modern digital world and the exchange of information. These three goals may certainly facilitate a more inclusive and sustainable Europe.  The programme adds in its introduction that, in pursuing those objectives, Prime Minister, you will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms. So far, so good. However, I would have liked to see an entire chapter in the programme devoted specifically to the defence of human rights, not just as a consequence to be drawn from other objectives but as a specific objective in itself. Estonia, which is a small country and is a friend of my country, Catalonia, must be guided not only by the logic of inclusion and sustainability but also by the explicit defence of human rights. Indeed, the human-rights deficit is not found only in third countries, which we constantly criticise: unfortunately it also occurs in many countries within the Union.  I am confident and convinced that, in the months to come, Estonia will go in the direction of denouncing any breach of fundamental rights in the European Union.

Everybody understands that it is impossible in just five minutes to respond to all of the questions raised here today, but I would like to touch on some of the issues. Taxation was mentioned. I would like to state that this Commission took a very clear position: all taxes have to be paid in the countries where the companies generate their profits. I am absolutely sure that during Estonia’s Presidency we will continue to follow that approach in our activities. Regarding connectivity, as you know, we have set three main connectivity aims for Europe. We would like to achieve those concrete results by 2025. I am talking about the Gigabit Society, 100 megabits-per-second networks and 5G networks. As we know, to reach those aims at least EUR 500 billion in investment will be needed. If we continue on the basis of the existing rules, there will be an investment gap equal to EUR 155 billion. The message is clear: we have to change our rules. That is why I would like to ask Parliament and also the Presidency to pay attention to those connectivity issues and to deal with spectrum issues for example. When we asked for deeper cooperation in the field of spectrum, we asked about the timing of spectrum allocation auctions. It has to be harmonised. Regarding the duration of licences, there is a minimum of 25 years and, as we know, in some rural areas 25 years will not be enough to break even and start to make profits. This is important in terms of giving predictability to mobile operators and, of course, regarding coverage issues. As we know, in Finland, Sweden and Lapland, population density is less than one person per square kilometre, but there is excellent access to 4G networks. Here, however, when travelling from Brussels to Strasbourg, there are tens of kilometres without any kind of access to the internet. So we have to change our rules.  Then we have to pay attention to geoblocking. As we know, this is a real headache in the European Union. According to our mystery shopping survey, two per cent of people who wanted to buy goods and services from another EU Member State just could not get access to the websites selling those goods and services, and 27% of people who got access to the websites were not able to register because their IP address was wrong. They were from the wrong countries – from France, from Germany, from Italy, from the United Kingdom, from Estonia, anyway from EU Member States – while 32% of those people who were able to register faced delivery problems. To deal with those problems, we launched our parcel delivery proposal. I hope that, during the Estonia Presidency, we will be able to reach consensus on these issues. However, 26% of the people who did not have any kind of problem with delivery issues could not pay. In the European Union we have the Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) but, nevertheless, 26% of people could not pay because their credit cards were issued in the wrong EU Member States – in Germany, in France, in Belgium, in the Netherlands, anyway in the wrong EU Member States. All in all, just 36% of all those people who wanted to buy goods and services from another EU Member State were able to conclude their purchases successfully. The issue here is not just about the single market we would like to have in the European Union, if only every third person is able to conclude purchases successfully: it is much more about discrimination on the basis of nationality or where a person’s credit card was issued. We do not have to accept that kind of discrimination in the 21st century in the European Union. (Applause) My speaking time has already expired. I hope that, during the Estonian Presidency, we will also be able to achieve concrete results in dealing with cyber security issues and many other important issues. I wish Estonia’s Presidency every success.

I have taken note of all your positions and opinions. We will work very closely with you, honourable Members of the European Parliament to make sure that citizens are at the heart of everything we do. The four economic freedoms of the single market are very important principles of the Union. The European Union has to be strong and united to go forward. I am certain that we will overcome all the current and future challenges. Now some remarks about your questions or your remarks. First of all, migration. I take it very seriously. It isn’t a question for the one or the other State. It is a question for all 28 Member States. Our goal during our Presidency is to find consensus. We must find consensus, and solidarity is an important topic here. I could say it is the cornerstone here. The first informal Council meeting of our Presidency will take place in Tallinn tomorrow. I would like to stress once more that we are fully committed to finding solutions to the refugee crisis. The issues are difficult but we are working towards a common solution. Solidarity must be there. The previous presidencies, Slovakia and Malta, have done a good job. Estonia is doing its best to keep the process on the right track in order to help to strengthen a common asylum system. We are highly committed to doing our share. Also I would like to mention that at the beginning of this week, the Estonian Government decided to allocate EUR 1 million to the EU trust fund for Africa. We encourage all Member States to increase their contributions to this fund. Some words about security and terrorism. There is no doubt that security and defence are top priorities for Europe. The European Union can only be taken seriously as a global player if Member States strengthen their own security and defence. Hence the need to raise defence expenditure levels. We must also take into account the interconnected nature of our internal and external security challenges. In addition to strengthening defence cooperation with the European Union, we must continue to move forward with EU-NATO cooperation. Some words about the social pillar. We are taking the social pillar very seriously. It is one of our top priorities. We will move forward on all social files, including the posting of workers and hope to adopt the proclamation endorsing the social pillar together with you. Some words about Brexit. When it comes to Brexit, Estonia’s main goal is the unity of EU 27 and to ensure that the divorce process is as smooth as possible. We must protect the rights of EU citizens in the United Kingdom. The second urgent question is the financial settlement and the third is the border issues with Ireland. These questions have to be settled before entering the second phase of the negotiations. Estonia fully supports Mr Barnier as the chief EU negotiator and also Parliament. We will be at the service of the Member States and work closely with all EU institutions involved. Honourable Members of Parliament, Estonia wants to contribute to making the EU a better place to live for everyone. One of our main priorities is a digital Europe and the free movement of data. We must deliver it because the unfinished nature of the digital single market costs us about EUR 400 billion a year. Completing the process is important to improve the everyday lives of our citizens. Ladies and gentlemen, if I may, I would also like to say some concluding remarks in my mother tongue. Siin oli arvamusi ka selles osas, et kas Euroopa Liitu on vaja ja kas tal on tulevikku. Eesti usub väga tugevalt, et Euroopa Liidul on ühine tulevik. Me oleme kindlad selles, et meie eesistumise ajal Euroopas tuleb ka näidata neid positiivseid samme, mida Euroopa Liit on pakkunud, olgu see rahu, olgu see inimeste, kaupade, teenuste vaba liikumine või olgu see ühine kultuuriruum.  Auväärt parlamendiliikmed! Ma näen, et teil on väga palju külalisi kõige kõrgemal korrusel. Ja mõned nendest on noored inimesed. Nad on väga õnnelikud, et siin Euroopa Liidus on Erasmus – ja see on ka üks näide Euroopa Liidu ühtsusest. Eesti soovib igal juhul ehitada oma eesistumise ajal sildu, mitte tõmmata piire või ehitada seinu. Eesti soovib igal juhul, et me Euroopa Liidu tulevikku arutame koos, mitte igaüks eraldi toas. Me soovime, et Euroopa Liit on järgneva kuue kuu jooksul rohkem ühtsem, tugevam ja turvalisem. Thanks for all these positive comments and to all those wishing us success. We will need good cooperation with all of you to make our Presidency a successful one. Thank you for your attention and thank you for our discussion.

Having read the Estonian Presidency's program and listening to the presentation of priorities, I would like to welcome Estonia's emphasis on the importance of gender equality, including support for work-life balance, to ensure that the growing need for skilled labor is met. The unequal division of labor in caring for children, the elderly and other dependent family members affects women's participation in the labor market and men's participation in family life. I therefore welcome Estonia's intention to continue the debate on reconciling family life, so that women can participate more actively in the labor market and the burden of their family worries can be reduced. I would also like to congratulate the Estonian Government on emphasizing in its presidency program that all Europeans must have equal access to the necessary skills, high-quality education, employment or services in order to ensure the sustainability of society and Europe's economic and social well-being. It is important to maintain high social guarantees for all EU citizens in order to ensure the free movement of persons, workers and services.

Building on the Hungarian example, the European Talent Support Network was established, which actively contributes to the discovery and development of talent, regardless of age, gender and social background.

It is also to be welcomed that the Estonian Presidency intends to make rapid progress in the negotiations on the Clean Energy Package.

The same logic, however, unfortunately inspired the resolution accompanying the agreement which, with the votes of the right of this Parliament, instead of strengthening the agreement itself and its implementation seems to follow more the agenda of the new US administration than that of the European Union, and for this reason we voted against. In the resolution, with the amendments voted today, the request for lifting the US economic embargo, requested by the UN General Assembly since 1992 - we want to remind you - is softened until it almost disappears. The European Parliament has thus today expressed a more backward position than that of the Council and the Member States. For what reason? For whom, if not to please an ideological vision that we have just heard expressed by my colleague, to please the American right, which wants to impose a destiny decided on Cuba in Miami and not by its people? Cuba is the target of the world and European neoliberal right because, despite the embargo, it has managed over the years to build a health, educational, sports and cultural system of excellence, an example for all developing countries. We demand an end to the embargo.

As we speak, thousands of people are marching from Ankara to Istanbul in protest at the large-scale purges that started after the failed coup attempt one year ago. The numbers are swelling every day, and more than one million people are expected to attend a peaceful march for justice when they arrive in Istanbul this coming Sunday. In a deeply polarised country, people from all walks of life are uniting to call for the restoration of the rule of law in their country. That is not only historic, it is also a hopeful sign that many in Turkey do not accept the authoritarian drift in their country. These people are fighting for their democratic rights, and we in the European Parliament stand side by side with all those in Turkey who believe in the same European values as us. At least half of the population voted against the new constitutional package in the referendum. Turkish students are protesting against the government-appointed rectors in their universities. And teachers fired under government decrees, Nuriye Gülmen and Semih Özakça, began a hunger strike in protest. As their strike neared the 80-day mark and their health faded, they were arrested and they have been in custody ever since. This shows how little space is left nowadays for freedom of speech in Turkey. But all of these examples also show how millions of people in Turkey are not giving up hope. One year after the failed military takeover, Turkish democracy is under great pressure. A heavy price is being paid by the Turkish people. The parliament and the constitutional court are bypassed as the government rules by emergency decrees. More than 150 000 people have lost their jobs, more than 50 000 people have been jailed, and all without having an opportunity to defend themselves. The continually deteriorating situation is South-East Turkey deserves special attention. Not only is the leader of the pro-Kurdish People’s Democratic Party (HDP), Selahattin Demirtaș, imprisoned, so are 12 of his colleagues and 87 mayors from that region. Especially in the areas where curfews were imposed, excessive force has been used by security personnel, and collective punishment has been applied to the inhabitants. However, this in no way justifies any of the killings conducted by the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), an organisation which has been on the EU’s terror list since 2002, and last week’s murder of two local Justice and Development Party (AKP) politicians is another sad example of how this conflict affects many people’s lives. The EU believes that there can only be a political solution to the Kurdish question.  When looking at the widespread crackdown on all dissent in Turkey, silence is the worst strategy for the EU to take in reaction. Not only does it leave millions of Turks out in the cold, it also fuels euroscepticism in our own countries and sends the wrong message to the other EU candidate countries in the Western Balkans. Let us take a look at some examples from the past weeks. Why was there no EU statement when journalists from the Sozcu newspaper were targeted? Why was there no EU reaction when the head of Amnesty International’s Turkish branch was arrested? And why was there no condemnation when a 14th member of the Turkish Parliament, Republican People’s Party (CHP) MP Enis Berberoglu, was jailed and sentenced to 25 years? We understand that Turkey is an important country and we have many joint strategic interests. We are not pleading for a stop to all dialogue and cooperation with Ankara, but what we are asking the Commission and the EU leaders to do is simply to stand up for our own values. By looking away, we are seriously undermining our own credibility. We support the Commission’s proposal to start negotiations on the modernisation of the current customs union with Turkey. This would not only be beneficial to both sides in economic terms, but it is perhaps also the only leverage the EU still has in making the Government of Turkey commit to European standards. On visa liberalisation, we encourage the Turkish Government to comply with the last five remaining benchmarks. Finally, while the political Groups in this House have very different views on EU-Turkey relations, I would like to thank especially my colleague rapporteurs from the other Groups in making sure that this Parliament speaks with one, clear and loud voice in condemning the Turkish Government’s serious decline in democratic standards, while continuing to support the Turkish population, millions of whom would like to continue to see the EU as an anchor for reforms in their country.

We cooperate in many important areas of joint interest, such as counter—terrorism, foreign and security policy, energy, the economy and trade, as well as migration. The EU—Turkey joint action plan for refugees and migration management and the March 2016 statement continue to be applied in the interest of both parties. So far, this cooperation has led to a significant decrease in deaths at sea and a substantial reduction of irregular migrant arrivals from Turkey. It has also led to an improved situation for Syrian migrants in Turkey. The EU Facility for Refugees in Turkey has made a significant contribution through additional funding in the areas of humanitarian assistance, education migration management, heath, municipal infrastructure and socio—economic support. We continue to appreciate Turkey for its enormous efforts in hosting and addressing the needs of around 3 million refugees from Syria and Iraq. Work continues on the issue of visa liberalisation, which, however, remains conditional on Turkey’s fulfilment of all the requirements of the road map. We look forward to any further progress regarding this issue during our Presidency this year. We follow the domestic developments in Turkey with deep concern. Regarding the April referendum this year, President Juncker, High Representative Mogherini and Commission Hahn issued a joint statement, which stressed that the constitutional amendments and their implementation will be assessed in light of Turkey’s obligations as an EU candidate country. We share many of the concerns to which you Parliament referred both in its resolution on Turkey from November last year and in relation to the draft resolution recently discussed and voted upon in the Committee on Foreign Affairs. Many of these concerns were also reflected in the Presidency conclusions of the General Affairs Council, adopted on 13 December 2016. The significant backsliding in the areas of the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights are deeply worrying and should be urgently addressed by the relevant Turkish authorities. The unequivocal rejection of the death penalty is an essential requirement for EU membership, and it is also part of Turkey’s international obligations. In contacts with Turkey the EU side takes every opportunity to recall these and other concerns, and we will continue to do so. Turkey needs to normalise its relations with Cyprus and fully implement the provisions of the additional protocol of their association agreement. Nevertheless, continued engagement and an open dialogue with Turkey remain important. The EU should remain the anchor for Turkey’s reforms. We continue to expect Turkey to respect the highest standards when it comes to democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental freedoms, including the freedom of expression. As for the situation in the south east of Turkey, the EU will continue to call for an immediate cessation of violence and terrorist attacks. This needs to be accompanied by a return to a credible and inclusive political settlement process and a genuine political dialogue, aiming at a political solution there.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 150, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Kati PIRI", "mepid": "37229", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to start by commending the rapporteur’s efforts to capture the main challenges in the complex EU-Turkey relationship in a very comprehensive report. I share the strong concerns of this House when it comes to the domestic situation in Turkey as already reflected in the Commission’s 2016 country report and in our public positions ever since. The number of jailed journalists remains very high – currently over 160, including some EU citizens. The situation of academics and of civil society in general has worsened. The opposition finds itself under ever-growing pressure. Honourable Members, I am deeply committed to improving EU-Turkey relations, but only tangible steps by Ankara, reversing the worrying trend on the fundamentals of our relationship, can accomplish this in the mid- and long term. For instance, the ad hoc committee offering remedies to excessive government measures after the attempted coup needs to produce urgent results. Continued close cooperation with the Council of Europe is vital in this context. I also echo Secretary-General Jagland’s call for the release of the two teachers on hunger strike, whose life-threatening situation is rapidly deteriorating. The letter to President Erdoğan, signed by the four largest political groups in this House on the situation of the freedom of the press, will hopefully show its the desired effect. In short, we cannot and we will not ignore the worrying developments in Turkey, precisely because we want fruitful bilateral relations. Turkey is a candidate country. With the statutes come rules and obligations, obligations and standards to which Turkey itself has subscribed. At the same time, our common challenges are growing by the day, from security in the wider region to the fight against terrorism to the handling of migration and refugees. To tackle these challenges together, it is in our European self-interest to have a stable, democratic, prosperous partner who acts under the rule of law. That is precisely why the EU was among the few first international actors to declare its full support for Turkey, its citizens and its democratic institutions after the terrible coup attempt nearly a year ago – that horrible night during which more than 240 people lost their lives, 2 200 were wounded and the Turkish Grand National Assembly was attacked and severely damaged. Madam President, honourable Members, when Presidents Juncker and Tusk met with President Erdoğan a few weeks ago, they agreed to pursue our agenda of engagement and open dialogue. This will include a number of high-level thematic dialogues and bilateral visits over the coming months. Furthermore, last week’s steering committee of the facility for refugees in Turkey, the rapporteur, Ms Piri, as well as the Chair of the Committee on Budgets, Mr Arthuis, could witness themselves that the facilities are being smoothly implemented, and it is delivering very tangible results on the ground for the refugees. We have given hundreds of thousands basic livelihoods. We have trained thousands of teachers, and they are giving hundreds of thousands of refugee children a formal education. We are now providing many with a socio-economic perspective. All of this is key to reducing migration pressure. Right after our discussion here today, I will fly to Ankara to meet with Minister Çelik and Minister for the Economy, Zeybekci. I will also visit a health project founded by the EU Facility for Refugees. My message will be clear. The European Union sticks to its financial commitments under the refugee facility. Our support has a clear impact, but our overall relationship can only move forward if there is a clear improvement of the domestic situation in Turkey. Honourable Members, closely engaging with Turkey is crucial. It is, however, equally important that we make it crystal clear that we all expect positive and tangible developments in and by Turkey. Yes, we engage, but we are not moving the goalposts in either direction. We continue to have a very close eye on what is happening in the crucial areas of rule of law and fundamental freedoms. That is not only a matter of fulfilling EU criteria and universal values; it is, first and foremost, the only way to end the deep divide in Turkish society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 151, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President! First of all, I would like to thank our rapporteur, Kati Piri, and also my colleagues from the other groups for the good cooperation. It is very remarkable how we got this report through this year. We have seen dramatic developments in Turkey, and the situation has already been adequately presented here: thousands of layoffs, hundreds of arrests, a witch hunt for politically dissenters, actually the abolition of the rule of law and a climate of fear, that prevails in this country. So how should we deal with such a country? In fact, I think we should have voted on this report, which we are voting on tomorrow, much earlier, namely before the referendum. Then we could have used our report to explain to the Turkish people what this constitutional referendum actually means. Because I claim: Hardly anyone in Turkey really knew what this referendum was about. The Turkish government has managed to mislead its own people. Because the constitutional changes are just not good for the country. But it is now clear to us: we must finally draw conclusions. And the Council of Ministers must finally have the courage to do this. Our citizens at home have long failed to understand why these bogus negotiations on EU accession are still going on and why the Turkish government is still receiving considerable financial resources from us. Of course, it is clear to everyone here - as has already been said - that a close and privileged relationship between the EU and Turkey is absolutely essential in the interests of both sides. But that can only be achieved if the relationship is based on respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, democratic values ​​and the rule of law. After all, the Turkey accepted these conditions when it became a candidate for membership in 1999. But unfortunately she has long refused to accept these core values ​​as her own. This shows that this country's accession is simply out of the question. And it is only logical if we now call for the negotiations to be formally suspended, which in plain language will mean the end of the accession negotiations if the constitutional reform package is implemented unchanged. The constitutional amendments clearly violate the Copenhagen criteria. However, Turkey has not met these criteria for a long time, and it has now underlined that again with the expropriation of Christian cultural heritage. Churches and all of their cemeteries were confiscated and transferred to the Diyanet religious authority. It is a mockery that Turkey says in the same breath: “And we want to continue to become a member of the European Union. “This is a very clear violation of our basic principles. We cannot accept that. We have to concentrate on another level, that will be the customs union. We should work towards this together, but also on the basis of the rule of law and respect for fundamental human rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 152, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Victor BOŞTINARU", "mepid": "39711", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Madam President, it was a very difficult year for Turkey. A very difficult and dramatic one. The failed coup d’état, the Syrian war in the sixth year, and Turkey has received more than three million refugees. The conflict in the south east continues. Turkey has faced a series of terrorist attacks. It is important to say it, and I understand that the security environment has change in Turkey as well as in the surroundings of the European Union. Therefore, yes, I’m worried about the Turkish democracy. I’m extremely worried when it comes to the fundamental freedoms in Turkey and the way the mass liquidation of media outlets is the result of the state action. The way in which there are mass arrestation of journalists, academics, judges, elected representatives of the opposition and so on and so forth. Today they are endangered by the actions taken by the current leadership of President Erdoğan. Our report is rightly pointing out all of this. Our commitment to the people of Turkey remains, nevertheless, strong. The civil society and the opposition in Turkey are waiting for us to be further engaged and support them not only in their survival – the physical survival sometimes – but in preserving the remains of the democracy in Turkey. Today they are continuing their march from Ankara to Istanbul, a march for justice and democracy. I salute them, all of them. So this is not the time to give up on Turkey. It is the time when criticism should be strong when necessary and when a constructive, open and pragmatic dialogue should be maintained. It is the appropriate time to stress that Turkey and the European Union does have a strategic interest and have to continue their cooperation in very important areas – migration, counterterrorism, Syrian war in the Middle East region, where Turkey can play a positive role.

I think it is extremely sad that we are once again standing here and regretting that developments in Turkey are going in the wrong direction. It went in the wrong direction last year and the year before that, and I wonder when we last rejoiced at the progress that has been made. Since the military coup took place just a few months after we debated our previous report, a state of emergency has prevailed. President Erdoğan has strengthened his grip on power, he has had government-critical party leaders, parliamentarians, mayors and journalists imprisoned without legal proceedings. In addition, well over 100,000 teachers, government officials and others have been fired for sympathizing with the opposition or Gülen movement that Erdoğan blames for the coup attempt. But it is not just Turkish citizens who are affected. A former EU parliamentarian, also chair of the Joint Parliamentary Assembly with Turkey, Joost Lagendijk, who now lives in Turkey, has been refused home for a year. We are pleased that his case is being highlighted in the report. We Greens do not want to close the door on Turkey, but we are still behind a freeze on the negotiations and we are also saying no to a modernization of the customs union in this situation. The EU and Turkey have strong ties and we hope that they will continue, but it is not easy today to defend further negotiations on either accession or an upgrade of the customs union with a regime that does not maintain any respect for either the democratic rules of the game, human rights or the rule of law. New in this year's report is that for the first time we are explicitly talking about interrupting the accession negotiations if the proposed constitutional changes go through unchanged. It is a strong signal not only to Erdoğan but to the Turkish Parliament and to the Turkish electorate. The ball is now with them. But the report also addresses deeper cooperation within other counter-terrorism and migration, and there our view is not entirely in line with that of the majority.On the one hand, we believe that it is not possible to have cooperation on terrorism with a country that refuses to change the terrorism legislation, which in principle can cover anyone who expresses an opinion other than the president's, and on the other hand, we believe that Turkey is not a safe country to send people.back to.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sv", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 159, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "on behalf of the EFDD Group. - Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, with tomorrow's vote, this House will finally take note of what we have been saying for some time: Turkey does not have the qualifications to be a candidate country for the European Union. The unacceptable changes proposed to the Constitution, the referendum campaign and the referendum itself, not to mention the polemics against some member states, the purges in the public administration and the crushed freedom of the press, make more and more evident an authoritarian tendency manifested by Erdoğan who, to tell the truth, we have been reporting for too many years. It was therefore inevitable - and I thank the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs for the excellent work we have done together - that this annual report would finally formalize this state of affairs and prove us right. The request to officially suspend the negotiations when these constitutional amendments are implemented was and is a duty.

Therefore, as long as the PPE Group does not understand that we have to get out of this logic with Turkey, we will not move forward.

Having purged public institutions and silenced the media under the pretext of responding to the attempted coup last year, the referendum this year has now confirmed constitutional changes that ensure that President Erdogan is soon to assume his much—coveted sultanesque role.  Turkey, as a NATO state and EU candidate country, however, is too important and too close to Europe to simply ignore. Difficult choices now lie ahead of us as to how to adapt the EU’s relationship with Turkey in the future, but we should take care to ensure that those choices are not dictated purely by necessity, rather than by our common values.

However, since then, Turkey’s accession to the European Union, and indeed their commitment to NATO, now both seem questionable. Despite failing to uphold recent nature commitments, citing financial pressure, Turkey has since funded the deployment of 3 000 troops to Qatar at a time of heightened tension across the Gulf. Perhaps symbolic of this change in Turkey’s path was instruction to chisel out the poignant words of Atatürk carved into a stone WWI memorial at Gallipoli which I now quote ‘Those heroes who shed their blood and lost their lives you are now lying in the soil of a friendly country. Therefore, rest in peace. There is no difference between the Johnnies and the Mehmets to us, where they lie side by side here in this country of ours. You, the mothers who sent their sons from faraway countries, wipe away your tears your sons are now lying in our bosom and are in peace. After having lost their lives on this land they have become our sons as well’. How Turkey has changed. (The President interrupts the speaker) The desecration of this moving epitaph leads many to suggest this is a further sign of the cultural shift taking place in Ankara. It seems to me that regrettably Turkey, under Erdoğan, is turning its back on secularism. I call on this House to acknowledge what we have long argued: Turkey is incompatible with EU membership.

Suppose absurdly that this debate took place in Turkey already entered: we would be bordering Syria, Iraq and Iran. Let's suppose that some of the speakers who spoke more critically had said these things with Turkey already in Europe: European arrest warrants from prosecutors in Istanbul or Ankara would already be ready. Let's reflect on this, perhaps also thinking about the fact that yesterday we recalled the values ​​that inspired Simone Veil. What would Simone Veil say to hear all these enthusiasts about the continuation of relations with Turkey? It is a battle for freedom that must be fought in deciding whether to continue or, as we say, permanently terminate these relationships for the reasons listed in the report itself. But today I have the moral duty to remember a great freedom fighter who died a few hours ago in Sardinia, in his Sardinia: Doddore Meloni, a freedom fighter. You see, the Italian state, which is often very weak with real criminals, has been obsessively harsh towards this fiscal objector, leader of Sardinia's battle for independence, whom I intend to honor and duly remember. He was an honest, clear man, a poet of politics, and this Europe which should be - as he hoped and thought, like us - a Europe of peoples, regions and even nations, of course, a Europe that should be a Europe of liberties, should not allow people to be incarcerated just for dreaming of the freedom of their own land. Honor to this patriot, and we remind Sardinia to be proud of this ensign of freedom, son of a land that wants to be free, disinterested and clear fighter for the independence of the island, of this beautiful Sardinia, which I want to remember. Therefore let's stay outside, let's keep Turkey and these counter-values which are the exact negation of what these patriots aspire to, these people who exalt their attachment to their land, to their freedom with their example.Long live the freedom of Sardinia, no to Turkey in Europe, never Turkey in Europe!", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ENF", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 174, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Sotirios ZARIANOPOULOS", "mepid": "125090", "text": "- Madam President, the report on Turkey reflects the escalation of tensions between the European Union and the Turkish bourgeoisie, in an area where forces are redeploying, imperialist rivalries are raging for markets, energy, transport routes, in which the bourgeois order of Turkey.

I will give you one example, because my speaking time is limited. And that is the way Turkey has been dealing with its minorities, such as Arameans, for a long time. Before the genocide of 1915 - and I use the word very consciously - there were one million Aramean Christians in the region, 40 years ago 70,000 in Eastern Turkey.

This shows a noticeable cluster of electoral districts that have a voter turnout of almost 100 percent and at the same time have shown far above-average yes results. So here it was statistically proven - with an error probability of less than one per thousand - that it cannot be a coincidence that the ballot boxes have obviously been crammed with yes votes.

We must continue to promote the values on which our Union is based. This is all the more evident when it comes to a strategic partner. The ball is now in Ankara’s court. It must clearly and tangibly move back towards these values and principles, and we stand ready to support it completely. We are ready to do this on many levels, ranging from high-level political dialogues to protection of human-rights defenders in Turkey’s civil society and continued investment in the roots of a future open society, from economic support to education, research and free media. In short, we must continue our principled, firm engagement with Turkey and support the positive currents in Turkish society, and I expect that we will continue the discussion here in the House to follow up on the events in Turkey and to stay in contact and in touch with them.

As I pointed out earlier, the Council is well aware of existing shortcomings, especially in the field of the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms. Several ideas were floated about how the European Parliament can help in this respect, not least by Marju Lauristin, on the ways of giving voice to those people who have to flee Turkey. This work must be continued. At the same time, it is are important to remember that the EU and Turkey have many ties. Our relations go back a long time. We have had – and are having – close cooperation in many areas, cooperation that has been positive for both parties. We continue to follow developments in Turkey very closely. We will continue to bring up our concerns in all our meetings and at all levels with Turkey. The EU should remain the anchor for Turkey’s political and economic reforms. That is where the continuing expectation of the standards that Turkey must fulfil comes in: continuing expectation enshrined in the Presidency’s conclusions from the General Affairs Council last December. The standards are there for all EU candidate and aspirant countries. If anyone says that we should give up on the expectations that those standards are being met, we may wonder whether this sends the right signal. Foreign policy is a very complex domain, but even there, some things are relatively easy – leaving the chair open, walking away, pulling the plug, if you will.

However, President Erdogan's reaction once again surprised Europe. The measures taken after the coup were illegal. Serious events followed, such as the shutdown of many media outlets, the arbitrary arrest of thousands of citizens, journalists, judges and human rights defenders, the closure of schools and universities that are not in line with Western culture, the violation of human rights and the questioning of the state. At the same time, the threatened implementation of the constitutional reforms by the Turkish government does not comply with the criteria for EU membership. Turkey will have to decide whether it really wants to continue the accession negotiations and stop undermining its accession prospects with talks to restore death penalty.

We have found ourselves under external pressure from migration flows driven by geopolitical and economic factors. The consequences are deeply felt on a day-to-day basis in many European countries. However, they are only a fraction of the discontent felt in many countries beyond our borders.  Facing mounting tragedies in countries thrown into conflict or extreme poverty, our responsibility is to act, to address the root causes of this situation and to help to create the conditions for a better life in these countries. It is clear that this will not happen from one day to the next, not even after a year. Therefore we need to look for long—term sustainable solutions, solutions which would bring growth, more stability, more jobs opportunities and solutions that would help societies to develop and adapt to the current world. There is no magic spell to solve the problems of the developing world, just as there is no magic spell to safeguard Europe from the increasing pressures of migration. We will be constantly challenged, yet we need to try new approaches and propose new solutions.  I therefore welcome the proposal for the External Investment Plan proposed last year by the Commission. With this framework, we can promote sustainable investment and tackle some of the root causes of migration in Africa and the neighbourhood. The European Fund for Sustainable Development is a vital part of this plan. It provides guarantees in order to stimulate private sector involvement in the socio-economic development of the partner countries.   I think this is the right approach in the long term. We need to match our development and investment expertise to enable the EU and the private sector to cooperate. We need an instrument which will operate in high-risk situations where investment would not be possible without our guarantees. This opens new challenges to boost investments and improve the business climate in the most fragile countries. In order to do this we need to stimulate investment in such areas as socio-economic infrastructure, SMEs or microfinance.  Once again, I am glad that we are ready to make this Fund a reality.  It will be a vital instrument to stimulate development in our partner countries and an important tool in our external policies. I hope that its innovative approach will help to improve living conditions in countries where it is needed and address the root causes of migration in the long term.

The EFSD is the first pillar of the external investment plan under which the Commission also plans to enhance technical assistance in partner countries (pillar 2) and to work towards improving the investment climate and overall policy environment in those countries (pillar 3). The main assumption is that supporting investment and private-sector involvement through innovative financing can foster sustainable and inclusive economic and social development and address the root causes of the migration crisis and promote the resilience of the partner countries in Africa and the EU neighbourhood, including in the least developed countries, with a particular focus on growth, the creation of decent jobs, youth and women, socio-economic sectors and, of course, small and medium-sized enterprises.

The progressive points we managed to include in the EFSD text are the following: reference to development effectiveness, resilience, decent job creation, the aim of poverty eradication and Articles 21 of the Treaty on European Union and 208 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union in the purpose of the instrument; and the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as objectives. On compliance in respect of tax standards and transparency, we managed to achieve major progress. We have ensured that counterparts are prohibited from entering into operations with entities incorporated or established in jurisdictions listed under the 11th EU policy on non-cooperative jurisdictions, or identified as high-risk third countries or countries that do not comply with the EU and internationally agreed tax standards on transparency and exchange of information. There is a reference, as well, to the relevant EU policy on non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes and specific reporting by the Commission. We now have greater transparency in relation to financial support provided by EFSD with an obligation for the Commission and counterparts to make information on projects, beneficiaries and expected development benefits publicly available wherever possible. The participation of the European Parliament in the strategic board as observers is warranted. We made a reference to the principles of development effectiveness and the conformity of objectives with the eligibility criteria for use of the EFSD; fulfilment of the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) criteria for the projects funded; and safeguard clauses on human and labour rights, including full observance of the UN principles for responsible investment, the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the OECD guidelines for multinational enterprises, the UN-FAO Principles for Responsible Investment in Agriculture and Food Systems, and all ILO Conventions, as well as international humanitarian law. We insisted on having a particular focus on climate-friendly investments, thus contributing to implementing the Paris Agreement, and setting a binding minimum target of 28 investments for climate action, renewable energy and resource efficiency. There are more things that I would like to highlight but, because of time constraints and last but not least, I would like warmly to thank the Commission negotiating team and the Maltese Presidency for their good cooperation, enabling us to agree on this new, innovative and important instrument of EU development policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 223, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL", "mepid": "96991", "text": "speaker. - Mr President, Commissioner, so far this year almost 100 000 people have reached the European shores who have had to leave their countries, their homes, their families. This morning, 49 have died trying to reach the Spanish coast. Because the greatest tragedy is not that they arrive, the greatest tragedy is that they lose their lives in the attempt. Today we are debating in this plenary session the launch of the European Fund for Sustainable Development, a fund that, unfortunately, is not going to totally eradicate the reasons why these people are forced to emigrate, but which intends to invest in their countries of origin to achieve sustainable development, to give them the opportunity to live in their country and have a decent life project. The causes of migration are many and complex, but the most important factors are security, economic, environmental and social factors. The objective of this fund is precisely to attack these causes at the root, by investing in projects that contribute to meeting the sustainable development objectives. Because this fund has to be a complement to official development aid, it has to pursue the same objectives, but it cannot and should not be a substitute. Because what we want is to mobilize private investment up to 44 billion, using the European budget as a guarantee, developing innovative mechanisms and thus reducing the uncertainties of investors. Getting the private sector involved in the economic and social development of these countries is a strategic objective. And this fund is not going to act alone - we have already mentioned it here -, it is part of the Foreign Investment Plan that has a technical assistance component to help partner countries attract that investment, private capital, and help prepare and promote projects. likely to benefit from this fund. And it also has a third pillar, fundamental for achieve the objectives, which is based on political dialogue, with the aim of developing a legal framework, policies and institutions that promote the necessary stability. This political dialogue ranges from the fight against corruption, tax fraud, organized crime, to the promotion of entrepreneurship, the development of local markets or an inclusive gender policy. This Parliament, with its proposals and during the negotiations, has sought and managed to improve the definition and realization of the objectives. In this way, we wanted to place special emphasis on financing projects that have a real impact and that focus on the creation of employment in decent conditions; to follow a strategy of sustainable and inclusive growth, and with special attention to the empowerment of women and youth. As I said at the beginning, migration has multiple causes, and one of them, to which we often do not pay the attention it deserves, is migration due to environmental causes. And, in this sense, I believe that the agreements that Parliament and the Council have reached allow us to allocate more resources to the fight against climate change, to renewable energies and to the efficiency of energy resources. Finally, I would like to highlight the very important step that we have taken in the fight against tax fraud, against tax evasion, against money laundering, as well as the elimination of any type of relationship with non-cooperative jurisdictions. And here I would like to especially thank the European Commission for its determination to put the fight against tax fraud as a priority, for promoting greater controls, country-by-country reporting and improving accountability. From Parliament, and I know that from the European Commission and from the Council, we have worked against the clock to be able to launch this fund as soon as possible and make it operational with a view to the Association Summits Eastern and the European Union-Africa.I hope that this fund is the first step in a renewed commitment by the Union to the development of our neighboring countries.We cannot allow thousands of people to continue leaving their homes due to lack of opportunities, risking their lives, dying at sea or in the desert, because the European Union has not done everything in our power.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 224, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Eider GARDIAZABAL RUBIAL", "mepid": "96991", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the European Parliament, and notably the three committee Chairs and rapporteurs, for their extraordinary engagement and excellent cooperation over the past months on this file. In spite of its complexity, a compromise was reached. This is a success and I congratulate us all for that. I also thank the Council, and in particular the Maltese and Slovak Presidencies, for their efforts to reach the agreement on the European Fund for Sustainable Development, which delivers on the request of the European Council to do so in the first semester of 2017. Our ambition must now be to quickly start the implementation of the external investment plan with a view to present tangible progress to the EU-Africa summit in Abidjan and to the Eastern Partnership Summit, both of them in November. Let me underline that the External Investment Plan with its European Fund for Sustainable Development will become an important instrument for attaining the objectives of the UN 2030 Agenda and will complete our toolbox for development cooperation. This is primarily a development instrument rather than exclusively a banking or financial one. It will steer our development partnership with the private sector in a focused and effective manner in order to contribute to reaching development goals in partner countries. The plan builds on experience. Since 2007 we have been implementing eight investment facilities which have leveraged a total investment volume of EUR 57.3 billion in our partner countries, with a total of EUR 3.4 billion of EU grants. To a large extent, this cooperation has been successful, as confirmed by the recent external evaluation on lending. The external investment plan is taking lessons learned into account. Let me reiterate the substance of the plan. It provides a holistic framework to improve investment and therefore decent job creation in Africa and the EU neighbourhood. It has three pillars: financing, technical support and enhanced investment climate. These must work hand in hand, and we are serious when we say that via the guarantees of the fund and existing investment facilities we want to leverage more than EUR 44 billion of investments in Africa and the neighbourhood until 2020. Our ambition for the European Fund for Sustainable Development is to go beyond existing instruments by supporting innovative financing models developed by partner financial institutions and an enhanced engagement of the private sector, in particular through the innovative new guarantee and the European Fund for Sustainable Development. Let me emphasise that the concept of additionality is very important. For us, it is really important. We do not intend to guarantee investments that the private sector would have made anyway. Under the European Fund for Sustainable Development, our partners must be able to prove that this is not the case by bringing in new products, new ideas, investments sustainably and where they otherwise would not go. We will also be coherent with the international fight against tax avoidance by making sure that financial vehicles supported under the instrument are not benefiting from any location in non-cooperative tax jurisdictions. All this will be implemented in a transparent and accessible way through comprehensive reporting requirements to the European Parliament and the public and through a new web portal managed by the Commission, and the European Parliament will have observer status on the strategic board. The board’s tasks will be to provide strategic guidance on overall investment goals and to ensure external policy coherence. This will give the European Parliament the opportunity to participate in the steering and monitoring of the overall implementation strategies and objectives of the European Fund for Sustainable Development.

I would like to congratulate on this big step because we are getting closer to our goal of setting incentives locally, in developing countries and above all in our neighboring countries, so that employment is created and that people get confidence in the future.

We then have the guarantees and the mixed financing with 2.6 billion, and then we actually trust that the private sector will accept these incentives accordingly. We know that, especially in developing countries, we have to make sure that the focus here is on rural areas, because of course the influx of people into the big cities and slums creates additional problems and we should therefore focus on incentives in rural areas . Your colleague has already said that, of course, small and medium-sized companies from the European Union and companies in our neighborhoods and in the least developed countries must have a chance to work together in the future - the main focus here should be on renewable energy . We have tied down this 28 percent financing share for climate change, so that we can set up digital markets there, that training and further education are established and that above all the sanitary conditions with water and sewage - especially in hospitals - are improved that the focus here is also on the social component.

But we don’t need it to be speedy just for institutional reasons to get it done under a certain Presidency. We need it because we promised this kind of thing in Addis Ababa two years ago. We promised that aid would be one part of the picture for funding development, and that we would also have private sector leverage and more tax revenues going in to help fund. I want to make this link with Addis Ababa to remind people that this is not an instrument to tackle migration except in as much as the instrument is to tackle poverty at its roots, create jobs and bring investment. It is not about managing flows into Europe. Most of the money comes from the European Development Fund, so it is right that the fund should focus on the least developed countries and fragile states.

If we do the same thing in Sub-Saharan Africa, that is about USD 66 billion today. So the European Fund for Sustainable Development can be part of the beginning of a new plan for Africa.

When people say that you have to act at source in the face of immigration forced by war, hunger or climate change, they are certainly not referring to this type of funds. What this Fund seeks is to alleviate consciences and for the border states to act as a wall for this forced immigration, a style that, unfortunately, the Spanish Popular Party has already invented on the southern border with Morocco. To do this, the European Union is resorting to the same bad magic trick: a fund in the style of \"Juncker plan\" that will cover possible losses from private investments, but which, in this case, will be losses of European multinationals doing business in countries of the world. south. Development cooperation does not consist in safeguarding our backs so that other countries act as guardians of our borders; It is not a question of seeing what financial ruse we use to make a good deal of these investments.

I have also been very determined in having explicit references to human rights and also to Article 21 of the Treaty on European Union. Let me please remind you about Article 21: the Union’s action on the international scene shall be guided by the following principles: ‘democracy, the rule of law, the universality and indivisibility of human rights and fundamental freedoms, respect for human dignity, the principles of equality and solidarity, and respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter and international law’. All these are crucial elements if the EFSD is to become successful in addressing the root cause of the migration crisis and promoting resilient societies. I have to be frank, migration is not a problem. People should be able to move freely between places and regions if they wish and like. But it becomes a problem when the conditions in the one region are so bad that people are forced to move due to the impossibility to lead a good life. This is why it should be ensured that the EFSD enhances respect for and the fulfilment of human rights. Civil society is instrumental in monitoring the human rights record.

And may I please also pay particular tribute to Emily Stewart in my office whose work on this has been exemplary and without whom I would not be able to be standing here and present this report to this House? I’m also extremely grateful to the committees that put their input into this report, namely the Development Committee, the Agriculture Committee and the Cultural Committee. But I am very disappointed that there were not more committees contributing to this process, because we have had many MEPs put forward their expertise, but we need a full breadth of committees involved in this process, because a key ask of this report is that the Commission use all of its departments and instil the UN sustainable development goals throughout all of the Commission’s departments. And unless we practise that in this Parliament, it will be difficult to act as the exemplar for others. Imagine if you will, a world where no child is born into hunger, where no child is born into poverty, where access to health care and clean water – some of the things you might take for granted – are available to everyone, where well-paid jobs, decent jobs, don’t come at the expense of the environment, and where we all act together as stewards, not owners, of this planet, and that we can forward it to the next generation. This doesn’t just have to be a pipe dream, and it certainly doesn’t have to be the preserve of one group in this House. This goal is something we as humans must all own and make a reality. The goals defined through the UN’s 17 sustainable development goals will achieve this if we put the necessary measures into practice. I am very grateful to the Commission for its initial assessment of progress, again but I have to be perfectly honest, it is not enough to look at existing work and then backfit it into the 17 UN sustainable development goals. We have to be honest with ourselves, not just about the scale of our ambition, but the scale of the task at hand. When we conduct our trade, when we develop shared energy networks, when we draw up financing rules, when we draw up strategies for transportation, when we evaluate education, when we drive forward change at a local, city, regional, national and European level we must always ask ourselves: ‘are we doing enough and is what we are doing delivering the UN’s sustainable development goals?’ We and our generation are running out of excuses, and we don’t have the excuse of previous generations of ignorance. We know how our actions today will affect the world around us tomorrow. There is a school group up there! Hello, it is your future we’re discussing today, and the decisions that we take in this place and across all of the EU’s institutions will have ramifications. It is great news that Vice-President Timmermans will chair the multi-stakeholder forum, but it is essential that the Commission use this forum properly to learn from other actors, to share best practice and to report back to this Parliament. We didn’t get everything through that we wanted to in this report and I’m sure we will hear from others about some of the compromises that don’t go far enough, and that is a fair criticism. But we must use this infrastructure to have a proper discussion; a proper discussion across all layers of government and hold the Commission to account on its promises, but also have the Commission report to us. I ask each and every group in this House to have somebody on their Bureau responsible for delivering this, because the world needs leadership.

The EU must now also demonstrate strong leadership in the implementation of the Agenda, both at home, at the EU Member State level, and in the context of the high-level political forum on sustainable development.  The Council conclusions adopted in June, ahead of the fifth session of the forum this month, stress our full commitment to the 2030 Agenda and the importance that the EU and its Member States attach to driving forward its implementation. Eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions is an indispensable requirement for sustainable development, which must be achieved in all its dimensions in a balanced and integrated manner. There can be no doubt about our commitment to achieving the 17 sustainable development goals by 2030, ensuring that no one is left behind and seeking to reach the furthest behind first. No doubt, we must promote social inclusion, with special attention to those who are disadvantaged, vulnerable and marginalised. Like the European Parliament, the Council continues to stress the need for the Commission to demonstrate that it takes the implementation of the 2030 Agenda seriously. We call on the Commission to elaborate an implementation strategy, outlining timelines, objectives and concrete measures to reflect the 2030 Agenda in all the relevant EU internal and external policies, taking into account the global impact of the EU’s domestic actions. This strategy should be based on a clear vision of how all relevant EU policies will contribute to the realisation of the 2030 Agenda.  There is an urgent need to identify gaps in all relevant policy areas within the EU to assess what more needs to be done by 2030 in terms of EU policy legislation and governance structure for horizontal coherence and means of implementation.  Even though much remains to be done in terms of concrete action, the Council of 20 June welcomed the steps proposed and taken by the Commission with regard to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and the sustainable development goal. On 7 June, the Council, represented by the Maltese Presidency, along with the European Parliament and the Commission, co-signed a new European consensus on development, which sets out our shared vision and framework for action for development cooperation. The new consensus aligns the Union’s development policy with the 2030 Agenda. This will be our main deliverable when we attended the high level political forum in New York in a few days. The Estonian mission to the United Nations has invited Ms Linda McAvan, chairwoman of the Committee on Development, as a speaker at one of the side events.  We, the EU institutions and Member States alike, should be proud of this achievement. It is our new ambitious collective European development policy, and it addresses in an integrated manner the main focus points of the 2030 Agenda: people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership.  This year’s theme at the Forum is at the heart of our new consensus –eradicating poverty and promoting prosperity in a changing world. Indeed, poverty eradication remains the primary objective of our development policy. At the same time, it integrates the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development and underlines the links between development and other policies, including peace and security, humanitarian aid, migration, the environment and climate change.  The new consensus also reaffirms our commitment to a rules-based global order with multilateralism and the United Nations at its core. Given the strong link with climate action, through the new consensus we are also giving a timely political signal to reaffirm our strong commitment to implement the Paris Agreement.  The EU Member States consider the High Level Forum as the main forum for sustainable development issues within the UN framework and are committed to progress towards implementation of the sustainable development goals. After the four EU pioneers, including my own country Estonia, which were among the first 22 countries to present voluntary national reviews last year, this year 10 out of 44 reports will be presented by EU Member States.  The European Parliament’s report on sustainability goals, adopted in May 2016, shows broad convergence with Council views on how to advance this ambitious agenda through effective implementation and we are looking forward to cooperating with you on this topic to ensure that, together, we reach our goals by 2030.

The Agenda 2030 declaration itself acknowledges the essential role of Parliament through their enactment of legislation and adoption of budgets and their role in ensuring accountability for the effective implementation of the Agenda 2030 commitments. So this report is very welcome, and we appreciate the high level of interest that it has raised as a signal of Parliament’s own commitment to engage in implementation and the review of progress. The United Nations 2030 Agenda, adopted unanimously by world leaders in 2015, represents a new global sustainable development framework. It is a commitment to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development by 2030 worldwide, ensuring that no one is left behind. The EU has been instrumental in shaping the 2030 Agenda and it is also committed to remain a frontrunner in the implementation phase. Sustainable development is a shared responsibility. It implies leadership from the Commission and other EU institutions, but also the full engagement of Member States and all levels of government at national, regional and local level and of civil society. I therefore welcome the opportunity here today to react to the European Parliament’s own initiative report in response to the Commission communication ‘Next Steps for a Sustainable European Future’ presented in November last year. From the perspective of my own portfolio, I am pleased to see in the report several strong references to how the environment and natural resources underpin the achievement of the broader sustainability agenda. I also welcome the references to the 7th Environment Action Programme, whose objectives map well on to the sustainable development goals (SDG). Indeed, it is crucial to ensure the full coherence between the different policies and ensure that the EU’s priorities as highlighted by President Juncker integrate our international commitments. I will ensure that the current 7th Environmental Action Plan evaluation will look at its consistency with our priorities and sustainable development goals commitments to pave the way for the period post 2020. The Commission’s communication of November highlights key EU policies for each of the 17 SDGs, particularly in the context of the 10 priorities of this Commission, and also outlines what further steps are envisaged. The response to the 2030 Agenda includes two work streams. Firstly, to mainstream the sustainable development goals in the European policy framework and Commission priorities, sustainable development becoming a guiding principle for all our policies. We are using our better regulation tools for this purpose. Secondly, further developing our longer-term vision and the focus of sectoral policies after 2020. In addition to that, we have said in our communication that the new Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) beyond 2020 will reorient the EU budget contributions towards the achievement of the EU’s long-term objectives. Stakeholder involvement will be crucial in implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Commission will therefore launch a multi-stakeholder platform chaired by the First Vice-President, Frans Timmermans, with a role in the follow-up and exchange of best practices on SDG implementation across sectors. The input of the platform will be very important for developing our vision for the future of SDG implementation through the second work stream. We need to have a good dialog with the European Parliament, the Council and the Member States in the second stream process as well. We are currently reflecting on how to best organise this. The successful implementation of the SDGs requires consistent monitoring. As requested by this House, the Commission will, from this year, provide regular reporting of the EU’s progress on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda based on a reference indicator framework. Stakeholders have been consulted on the choice of these indicators. A periodic report is expected to be published in November this year. Initiatives, supported by the Commission for the next month, include a non-toxic environment strategy, an ambitious plastics strategy and a comprehensive review of water legislation. The report recognises that economic growth will only be possible by respecting planetary boundaries to ensure a life of dignity for all. The evidence is clear that moving from our linear to a more circular economic model significantly improves resource efficiency and therefore cost efficiency, and creates more jobs. I also noted the report considers that significant acceleration of green investment, innovation and growth in the EU is needed, including use of new financing tools and different approaches to current investment policy. I particularly welcome the reference in the report to the Commission’s joint communication on the future of our oceans and could not agree more with the statement that urgent action is needed in the EU and globally. This was made clear at the UN Ocean Conference in New York last month and will frame the agenda for the EU Our Ocean Conference in October in Malta. The UN high-level political forum starts in just 5 days and leads to a ministerial meeting on 17 to 20 July. My colleague Commissioner Mimica will attend on 17 and 18 July. We see the high-level political forum as a critical component of the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. It is the principal UN body to review progress, identify challenges and make recommendations to help ensure we achieve the SDGs. During his visit, Commissioner Mimica will also highlight progress with the EU’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda, both internally as well as externally. He will also make clear that the EU is determined to play its full part in promoting the implementation of the Agenda through its internal and external actions. The Commissioner is also expected to highlight the new European consensus on development as a landmark document for the EU, having been agreed by the Commission, Member States and the European Parliament and applying to both the EU and its Member States, in their national capacity. The Commissioner will make a statement on behalf of the EU and its Member States in the general debate of the ministerial meeting of the high-level political forum on 17 July. He will also host a separate side-event at the high-level political forum to introduce the new consensus to our international partners. Other sessions of the high-level political forum will cover a range of issues, including sessions on specific sustainable development goals: sustainable development goal (SDG) 1 on poverty, SDG 2 on hunger, SDG 3 on health, SDG 5 on gender equality, 9 on infrastructure and 14 on oceans. In addition, 44 voluntary national reviews will also be presented at this year’s high-level political forum, including from ten EU Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 257, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Liadh NÍ RIADA", "mepid": "124987", "text": "   Dréachtóir do thuairim an Choiste um Chultúr agus um Oideachas. – A Uachtaráin, maidir leis an tuarascáil seo atá faoi bhráid an Choiste um Chultúr agus um Oideachas, ba mhaith liom an bhéim is mó a chuir ar SDG 4, cursaí oideachais agus nascacht tuaithe.

It affects us all. The question of how we shape sustainability has a direct impact on our present and our future. The United Nations adopted 17 detailed sustainability goals in the 2030 Agenda, which were also the basis for our report. For me in the Agriculture Committee it was important that we consider all three pillars - social, economic and environmental - to be taken into account as being equally important. Sustainability can work if a feeling for regionality and production processes in the primary products develops again. The social pillar in rural areas - with tourism, lived village culture with associations such as voluntary fire brigade and music bands - creates more than just living and working space. According to a study, the world population will rise to nine billion people. This presents us farmers with major challenges.

I was appointed shadow rapporteur for this report on the European Union's action for sustainability, which provided an opportunity for the European Parliament to anchor its vision and agenda in a European action for sustainability. However, it must be said that we still have a long way to go. We need the definition of the global strategy to implement the 2030 Agenda, which encompasses the areas of internal and external policy, a detailed timetable until 2030, an effective and complete system for monitoring and monitoring and specific progress indicators relating to the internal application of the sustainable development goals in the European Union. In my opinion, this is an ambitious and well-attended report. 308 amendments were presented by the different political groups and more than 30 compromise amendments. In this report, emphasis was placed on the fight against climate change and the decarbonisation of the economy, the protection of the oceans, the circular economy and resource efficiency, the promotion of science, technology and innovation, sustainable agriculture, nature conservation, the integration of Agenda 2030 in the European Semester, the fight against inequalities between other Member States and between Member States and the protection of the most vulnerable and marginalized. We recognize that, in order to achieve sustainable development goals, the participation of all stakeholders in the European Union will be required and, therefore, we urge the European Commission to ensure that the multilateral platform announced in its communication becomes a model of good practice to facilitate the planning, execution, monitoring and review of the 2030 Agenda. I believe that the European Parliament must have a clear and decisive role in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda that is deeply alignedwith the principles and values of the European Union.I also believe that achieving the sustainable development goals and the 2030 Agenda can be the legacy that Europe will leave to future generations.I close, Mr. President, by saying that this report shows that this house has an undeniable role in creating a better and more sustainable future, and I want to thank Seb Dance for all the effort and all the effort that he has dedicated, especially together with the rapporteurs-shadow for the development of this work, which is a beautiful work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 261, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Miriam DALLI", "mepid": "124970", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, let me start straightaway by congratulating you, Seb, on the amazing work you carried out. I know it wasn’t an easy task, but you managed to come up with a very good and well-balanced report, and congratulations once again for that. As we have heard today, today’s challenges call for both policies and approaches, because we have a number of challenges. For example, global economic growth is far from being robust. Fast technological progress and globalisation are creating opportunities for some, but they are causing immense challenges for others. We have societies that are aging rapidly and others with as much as 66% of the population under the age of 26. The former are finding it difficult to support their aging population; the latter are finding it difficult to create enough opportunities for their young. Many countries are also being impacted by great natural disasters and with climate change, weather events will continue to worsen for decades to come. And this is why we need to make sure that the sustainable development goals are implemented and are not merely words on paper. This is why today and every single day until the goals are achieved, we must take concrete steps to make the world more sustainable. But to do this, leadership in all countries and at all levels of society is badly needed. Governments, parliaments, businesses, civil society organisations, the media and citizens need to be all engaged to find efficient sustainable solutions locally, nationally and also globally.

That is really the question. In the committee, we have concluded a very good report, and I hope that Parliament will remain strong and united at the plenary level and maintain the position as expressed at committee level.  I would like to draw your attention to some specific points. First of all, I argue specifically for due consideration of the social aspects of the SDGs and specific action for vulnerable groups. There are several deficiencies, also within the EU, in access to water, sanitation, along with other natural resources and basic services, such as air, water, affordable and sustainable energy, health and nutrition, which particularly hit vulnerable groups. The Commission and the Member States must urgently ramp up their efforts, correct these deficiencies and provide specific tailor—made support for marginalised, low-income households and groups like the Roma community within the EU. Moreover, there is a broad agreement on the need for a comprehensive EU strategy for the implementation of the SDGs.

We found some passages to be very aggressive, in particular they were viewed by the farmers as an attack on the farmers. However, we need sustainable development with farmers, with industry, with all partners, and that is why I am very happy that we have succeeded in working out compromises with the rapporteur, so that we can do this more clearly in the report than it has been up to now do. We want to take people with us, we want to take everyone involved who also has to adapt. But I also say very clearly: those involved must also be ready for it. Nor can one say: nothing must change in industry, nothing must change in agriculture, we have to work together to find new ways - innovative ways - of how we can actually reconcile economic growth, social and environmental aspects.

On the other hand, I believe in the ability of our nations to act for the sustainability of the world and for their own sustainability.

Energy is obviously one of the first human rights, which conditions access to so many other human rights, be it water, health or employment. Energy is an absolutely powerful territorial balancing factor. Mr. Borloo, of course, is not from my political family, but whatever. I discussed this project with him, he explained it to me and I would like to make my contribution here. Our nations - France in the lead - must mobilize. Africa's electrification will naturally help this continent and its people, but it will also benefit us greatly, by curbing already insane migratory movements and accelerating our own rate of economic growth.

Transparent strategies that are binding in terms of time and that the Committee on Development is calling for contain three points in particular that I would like to emphasize. Point one: the financing. Official development cooperation, i.e. ODA, must finally achieve the status of the central instrument for the realization of the 2030 goals. This will only happen if all member states and the EU finally fulfill their binding commitment to finally provide at least 0.7% of their gross national income for official development cooperation. We should continue to design the future multiannual financial plan in such a way that the Agenda 21 goals are prioritized and achieved. Second: trade. Trade agreements between the EU and the Member States should pay more attention to fair and sustainable conditions. This includes compliance with the core labor standards of the International Labor Organization, i.e. the anchoring and implementation of the OECD guidelines for multinational companies. And third, climate diplomacy should be pursued as the central goal. The whole world is now looking to Hamburg for the G20 summit, to which this challenge will be the main theme.

By maintaining the landscape, farmers and female farmers contribute not only to sustainable food security, but also to the environment and nature. Much has been said about sustainable agriculture. Do we realize enough here that the majority of European agriculture, livestock and horticulture already produces sustainably? Don't we forget that? Through innovation and increasing environmental awareness, Dutch farmers and horticulturists save CO2 and deliver top quality products. These good examples must be better rewarded by the European Union. Let's beware of moving our food production to third countries with less environmental legislation. Only a level playing field with effective measures and without unnecessary bureaucracy can stimulate sustainable agriculture. European and Dutch farmers and horticulturists have been feeding the world population with meat, dairy, grains, fruit and vegetables in a sustainable and resource-efficient manner for years now.

The dwindling resources due to climate change are exacerbating the economic and social tensions that are already present in these areas. Millions of people cut him on a risky journey to the developed world, but most often they do not find a new home but end up in camps. This often life-threatening emigration, which divides families, cannot provide a real solution in either development policy or sustainability. Living conditions must be created locally and in certain regions. The European Union must develop sustainable, international development programs that consider not only so-called non-governmental organizations, but also various religious organizations and churches with a long tradition in the regions and often thinking of millions as a single organization.

It is clearly a call for an ambitious response to the 2030 Agenda and I can assure everyone that sustainable development is and will remain at the heart of EU policy-making. But we have to be operational: sustainable development is complex and interlinked and so must go beyond simple declarations. The Commission is committed to ensure an agenda of results, and I have had the opportunity to remind the Environment Ministers that we will not be judged only on what we announce but on what we do. But we need to make certain that all of the other Ministers of all the other sectors are on board with us as well. Many MEPs spoke about implementation and accountability and, as I mentioned in my introductory speech, we will be monitoring consistently to ensure the successful implementation of the SDGs. The Commission will provide regular reporting of the implementation progress. The reporting will be based on a reference indicator framework. The indicators were arrived at after extensive consultation with a number of stakeholders, and we will start as of this year, and the report will be published in November this year. With regards to reporting, I would like to mention here the Environmental Implementation Review and, as outlined in the report, the EIR has already served as a useful tool in highlighting implementation gaps in the Member States, and the Commission has already started to take action based on these. For example, the clean air dialogues will help reach solutions to common challenges, and full implementation of the NHL action plan will help ensure that we meet the objectives of the Birds and Habitats Directives. Work is already being done by the Commission as well on other fronts. We mentioned circular economy. A lot is also being done on SDG 14 in protecting our oceans to the EU’s Ocean Governance Initiative. But let’s be very clear: SDGs are not exclusively and only about the environment and development, and in this context, I particularly welcome the proposal in the Seb Dance report for a cross-committee working group on sustainable development goals to ensure a horizontal working within Parliament as well. This would then also provide an opportunity for Members of the European Parliament who have not yet put forward opinions to also engage in this topic. Last but not least, we are committed to taking the implementation of the 2030 Agenda forward.

That is not the role of this place. However, Mr Eck was also correct in saying we cannot shirk our responsibilities. We cannot pretend that things are not as they are. It is the case that current production methods in meat consumption, for example, are driving us towards an unsustainable future, but that doesn’t mean we can’t collectively find the solutions. Already across this Chamber we’ve heard ideas in this place. There are ideas that will be shared in the multi-stakeholder framework. It is only through this dialogue, through this process of conversation, that we will get to a stage where industry and businesses and citizens and NGOs and all of us can work together for that sustainable future.

I will suggest some to you: the hemicycle in Brussels is falling into ruin; the cost of the work would be 500 million euros over fifteen years.

This discussion, like all those that have preceded it, is not timely. Article 341 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union provides that the seat of the institutions of the Union is to be determined by common accord between the Member States and, even if it is for us to decide, the debate would still be irrelevant. However, since it is open, I take the liberty of responding to the practical arguments put forward by the supporters of a single Brussels seat. Only the practice of parliamentary work has normalized the frequency of our presence in Brussels. The treaties inscribe the official seat of the Parliament in Strasbourg. Revising them to deprive Strasbourg of this status will open the way to many questioning and bargaining on all European institutions and agencies. In addition, buildings in Brussels could require renovation estimated at 300 million euros, or even reconstruction, which would weigh even more on the taxpayer. As for the proposal to allocate the seat of the European Medicines Agency to Strasbourg, let me point out that Strasbourg has already been ruled out by the French government in favor of the city of Lille. But, even more, the lack of opportunity for the debate is not only of a practical nature, it is above all due to the importance of our presence in these places. Being in Strasbourg is not a fantasy. This location has a history, a meaning and a future. Undoubtedly, Strasbourg is the very incarnation of part of the history of European construction, even of its essence. The city is precisely the symbol of the brotherhood of peoples that the Union seeks and consolidates a little more every day. It is a manifestation of the benefits of peace, of Franco-German reconciliation.It was in Strasbourg that Simone Veil presided over the first European Parliament elected by universal suffrage.It was in Strasbourg that Helmut Kohl received the tributes he was due last Saturday.I hear the lawsuit made by some colleagues, but turning our backs on this heritage would be a serious mistake, especially since the single seat that would end the transhumance could as well be in Strasbourg.(The speaker accepts to answer a 'blue card' question (Rule 162 (8) of the Rules))", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 307, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "Ask about the “blue card” procedure.- Mister President!Thank you, colleague.It is certainly undeniable that the importance of Strasbourg as the European capital needs to be recognized and that, of course, a possible relocation of the European Medicines Agency to Strasbourg does not give sufficient credit to this issue at all.Nevertheless, I would like to ask you: you just mentioned Lille.Do you seriously believe that Lille has a chance?What criteria -

As early as 1981, the Zagari report was already positioning itself for a single seat for the European Parliament, with a sort of interim status for Strasbourg. The arguments have already been made and we know them: 114 million euros, the lowest estimate for monthly transhumance imposed by the treaties; 89%, the building vacancy rate, which we invest only four days a month; two days per month, or 10% of the time, lost moving, with disastrous consequences for the climate: 19,000 tonnes of CO2 per year - the Paris agreement is crying because of our wanderings.

For many of the citizens, it's not just a shake of the head, it's a decided rejection. At times like this, spending 114 million euros a year on this traveling circus - as a Greens, I also say that I also spend 19,000 tons of CO2 on it - only actually using this Parliament 48 days a year - most of the time it is empty - that is no longer possible these days. No company would do that. It also has a European aspect of democracy. As MEPs, we want to decide for ourselves where we meet. We are currently not allowed to. This Parliament has already said umpteen times by a two-thirds majority: we want one seat and not two.

It is something that nobody can explain, nobody can justify, and yet nobody can change, and there are many, many policies of the European Union of which you can say the same. I think of the common fisheries policy, I think of the Emissions Trading Scheme. The list goes on. I have been able to use this metaphor again and again in speeches up and down Britain in order to explain to ordinary people who are not very familiar with the European project the complete absurdity of it, and they catch it straight away. Ms Lunacek said companies would never do this. She is right. I say to people: are you in business? Would you move your business from London to Edinburgh for a week and then back again, and then to Edinburgh for one week every month? Of course they would not, and they see the absurdity of it.

For the single seat, no problem, Strasbourg is ready to welcome it. But what is Strasbourg? More than a city, a crossroads of Germans, Celts and Romans from the 5th century. It is the place of all the kingships and powers which made the Europe of peoples and civilizations: the Carolingians, the Capetians, the Holy Empire of the Hohenstaufen and the Habsburgs, this in the lineage of Saint Odile and Aldaric . It is the place of all the issues and conflicts for 1,500 years between East and West, the bone of contention of fratricidal struggles and world wars, with this banner of the Virgin of Strasbourg, arms outstretched between the 'East and West, which calls for this permanent reconciliation. This territory is the axis of balance between peoples and nations, the basis of Europe. If you haven't understood this - which I'm afraid - you haven't understood anything in Strasbourg. But neither did you understand anything about Europe which cannot be under unipolar domination. The cabal against the siege of Strasbourg wants to be pragmatic. It is fundamentally ideological. Your arguments do not stand up to the facts: Strasbourg cost too much? The Paul-Henri Spaak building cost 1.8 billion euros and to renovate it would cost 300 to 500 million euros. Let's make the single seat in Strasbourg. Strasbourg would be too far from the other institutions? What about a multipolar Europe? My dear colleagues, if you are abandoning Strasbourg, it is because Strasbourg is outside the spheres of influence of pressure groups. Those who want to give it up? Lobbies that work against Europe.

Strasbourg is a hugely wonderful city, but this divide calls into question the EU's ability to cooperate and act. Secondly, it has become clear that the Member States do not seem to be able to reach an agreement on the move to Brussels, because France has opposed the move to Brussels. The Protocol on the location of the seats of the institutions and of certain bodies, offices, agencies of the European Union specifies that the seat of the European Parliament shall be Strasbourg, where twelve monthly plenary sessions shall be held. The most sensible option would be to amend the treaties so that the European Parliament can decide where it works. If France does not agree to change the current arrangement, I propose that the Strasbourg weeks be shortened first to three, then to two and finally to one day, while the plenary sessions in Brussels be extended. The travel rumba to Strasbourg would continue 12 times a year, but Parliament would only sit here for one day at a time.

This report comes a few months after the publication by the European Commission of its new communication on the outermost regions of the Union (ORs), a decision that I want to welcome. But more than a new strategy, what the ORs now need are concrete, rapid and effective measures for the employment of young people, for fishing, for their access to all the Union's horizontal programs. and trans-European transport, energy and telecommunications networks. All this through the full implementation of article 349. All the more so since we have, today, the legal force to do so, with the decision of the Court of Justice of December 15, 2015. What we are asking for Basically, it is not a larger budgetary effort - this debate will perhaps come - but simply the implementation of policies better suited to our particular situations, as authorized by the Treaty. What I call the OR culture must be better irrigated and better shared in all Union policies, in all Directorates-General, which is, you will agree, not always the case. The question which, from my point of view, is essential, is that of the necessary transversality and the alignment of European policies. Because it is not consistent that the major efforts made, on the one hand, in the cohesion policy by Commissioner Crețu, whose commitment I would like to salute here, are annihilated, on the other, by d other policies, by other committees which still refuse to fully apply article 349 and to take into account the particularities of the ORs. This is precisely what needs to be corrected. This is what President Juncker himself stressed at the OR Forum and it is this change that this report is advocating today. I am thinking of trade policy and free trade agreements which, as you know, are very often devastating for our fragile economies and which must, from our point of view, take into account upstream, in the negotiations themselves, the interests of our productions, such as sugar for Reunion Island, bananas for the West Indies and milk for the Portuguese and Spanish outermost regions, which are, moreover, already very weakened by the disappearance of quotas. The European Parliament therefore wished, through this report, to take an objective assessment of the implementation of Article 349 and to formulate a number of proposals. To conclude, I want to tell you about our concerns about the future of cohesion policy beyond 2020. I want to tell you about our concern about its risk of distortion in relation to these solidarity objectives. I want to tell you that, if financial instruments were to replace subsidies, the objectives we are setting for the outermost regions will then be very difficult to achieve. This is why, in the future of cohesion policy, the less developed regions of Europe, such as the outermost regions, whatever this policy, will have to be sanctuary.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 367, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Mr Omarjee for his report. The situation of the outermost regions is unique, as is recognised in Article 349 of the Treaty. This report comes at a very appropriate time as the Commission is preparing a renewed strategy on these regions, which should be adopted by the end of October 2017. The report calls for more extensive use of Article 349 of the Treaty. I would like to reassure you that the Commission, within the framework of the upcoming renewed strategy on the outermost regions, and on the basis of Article 349, will look at all EU policies and consider, when relevant and justified, whether specific measures and adaptations are necessary. However, I would remind you that the Commission has already proposed specific provisions, spanning various EU policies, to take into account the situation of the outermost regions. The Commission will take stock of the progress made since 2012 when the last strategy for the outermost regions – for their smart, sustainable and inclusive growth – was proposed. Since then a lot has been done to boost the competitiveness of local enterprises and to reduce the ‘accessibility gap’. Let me take the recent example of state-aid-specific provisions, to which my colleague Commissioner Vestager has devoted a lot of attention, addressing the concerns expressed by these regions. However, major challenges remain, including high unemployment rates, which, of course, affect young people in particular. Hence we need to pool our efforts to address the concerns of ordinary people in these regions and offer them better prospects. The report sends important messages about the collective role of all EU policies and programmes in the development of the outermost regions. Cohesion policy plays a crucial role and specific provision for these regions addresses their needs and location. The Commission also agrees on the importance of investing in research and innovation, helping these regions to deploy their smart-specialisation strategies. We are committed to further boosting the outermost regions’ strengths and building on their extraordinary assets, their rich biodiversity and their unique position in the world. We would like to help them to have a leading role in fields such as renewable energies and the blue economy. In parallel, helping the regions to close their accessibility gap will be crucial. Here we are thinking not only about transport links but also about digital connectivity. Cohesion policies have helped considerably to reduce this gap. The collective involvement of all parties – the outermost regions, Member States, and all relevant stakeholders in the European Union – will be crucial to ensure that assets and specific issues are taken on board in an appropriate manner.

In this report, we underline the support given by the European Union to the outermost regions, as well as the need to make better use of their strengths. This translates into concrete proposals in various key areas for the ORs. First, at the agricultural level, we call for maintaining the program of options specific to remoteness and insularity (POSEI) and to pay particular attention to certain sectors, in particular those of bananas and sugar. We also urge the European Commission to implement the recommendations that we adopted on April 27, as part of a resolution on the management of fishing fleets in the ORs. In terms of international trade, due to the fragility of the economy of the ORs, we insist on the need for the Union to take this into account when concluding trade agreements with third countries. If safeguard clauses are to be included, it is important that they are effective in order to protect our overseas producers. Regarding cohesion policy, we call for maintaining, after 2020, the specific arrangements for the ORs and for greater flexibility in order to better adapt to their specificities. Finally, with regard to policies relating to research, education, the environment, business competitiveness, transport and telecommunications, we invite the European Commission to take better account of the ORs in order to 'assure them effective participation in the various programs.I am happy that Parliament insisted on the Erasmus program in order to allow effective participation of all overseas territories - ORs and OCTs combined - in the program by adapting the grants to the remoteness of the continent.In a few months, the Commission will adopt its new strategy for the ORs.I therefore hope that it will be ambitious and will have concrete avenues for ensuring the sustainable development of the outermost regions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 370, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Louis-Joseph MANSCOUR", "mepid": "124725", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D group. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, my first words will firstly be to underline the quality of my colleague Omarjee's report and above all to congratulate him on this collective work.

I am very fond of these areas and their people. The outermost regions are an integral part of the European Union, but due to their specific geographic location, they face particular challenges in their development. It is therefore only logical that we adapt European policy, where necessary, to their special situation. And then the much-discussed article 349 comes into play. And that Article 349 lays the legal basis for customization in European policy. The European Commission could be a bit more innovative with this. However, it should be noted that specific measures for the outermost regions need to be balanced and, perhaps, in the report, we sometimes call a little too enthusiastically for additional support to producers of bananas, cane sugar and milk production in the Azores .

In the report we talk a lot about environmental sustainability and blue growth, but here I must point out two major dangers that our seas unfortunately run. The first are litter, marine litter, which is a real global emergency. According to a study by the European Commission itself, in addition to causing serious environmental damage to coastal communities, economies, tourism, navigation, fishing and biodiversity, they cost European taxpayers at least 630 million euros. I must point out another looming danger: the extraction of oil and gas, the exploration for minerals in deep-sea deposits. These have serious repercussions on sensitive marine areas and irreversibly damage marine species and vulnerable ecosystems. Gentlemen, if we do not address these issues and if we do not stop the multinationals, the strong powers, which aggravate environmental problems and destroy our economies with the TTIP, with the CETA, even a coherent and uniform implementation of article 349 will not be able to contribute to a truly harmonious and balanced development of the outermost regions, endowed with an incredible natural heritage to be protected and enhanced.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 376, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "- Mr President, many thanks to Mr Omarjee for his report.

POSEI plays an essential role in the maintenance and development of agricultural production and the processing industry in these regions, which suffer unemployment rates much higher than national averages. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to maintain, and reinforce, where appropriate, these programs: without POSEI, there is no future for the agricultural sector.

The fleet, for safety reasons, older than twenty years, is dangerous, inefficient and polluting. With strict conditions, you don't have to jeopardize sustainable fishing.

The Commission is willing to build on the specific partnership the EU has with these regions, and to engage further with them to support their development, as President Juncker also stressed at the Forum of the Outermost Regions, which we hosted in Brussels at the end of March this year. The report also recognises the important contribution of EU policies and funds, and calls for better integration of the outermost regions in EU horizontal programmes. For instance, the report rightly mentions the need fully to exploit the research potential in these regions and to do so by improving their participation in Horizon 2020 with regard to the trans—European networks in the field of transport. For instance, the report calls on the Commission to ensure the effective integration of these regions. The Commission will explore how to include these regions better in the trans-European transport network, as connectivity remains an important challenge to address. The report also highlights the importance of specific regimes, such as specific taxation schemes. The Commission is aware of the role these schemes play in terms of supporting the outermost regions in developing their economies. However, their evaluation and possible adaptation over time are needed. The report also acknowledges the importance of agriculture – as you have already said – and specific support for the outermost regions to address their particular agricultural challenges. Without prejudice to the negotiation on the future EU multiannual financial framework (MFF), the Commission is committed to maintaining the specific aid provided by the Programme of Options Specifically Relating to Remoteness and Insularity (POSEI). Regarding your concerns about the situation of the fishing fleet, we agree on the need for safer and more efficient vessels. However, the total fishing capacity should be commensurate with the sustainable exploitation of fisheries stocks. In order to achieve that, we need data on the state of the stocks, which we currently lack. To fill this information gap, we will need the active involvement of both the Member States and their outermost regions so as to understand the situation of these stocks better and to recognise if management measures are needed. As for aid towards the construction of new vessels, something currently not eligible for public funding in the EU, the Commission understands the concerns of the regions and is examining ways, within its competences, to address them while remaining consistent with its internal and international commitments. The Commission will also look at the proposal for a dedicated support system for sustainable fisheries in these regions in the context of preparation for the post—2020 MFF, following close consultation with stakeholders and on the basis of an appropriate impact assessment. With regard to international trade agreements, the Commission will continue to pay attention to outermost regions’ concerns, not only in the negotiation phase but also in the implementation and review phases of the agreements, in particular the relevant economic partnership agreements. We cannot react here to all the important points that this report raises. However, I would like to assure you that the Commission will pay great attention to the full report as an important contribution to preparing the renewed strategy vis-à-vis these regions.

On behalf of the Commission, I would like to express my renewed condolences to the families and the loved ones of the victims and I would also like – this cannot be repeated too often – to pay tribute to the courage and the outstanding work of the brave firefighters who fought the blaze. I know about the firefighters personally. I saw them in many areas on the ground. Europe is about solidarity and I am proud that the EU could help Portugal at a time of great need. On 18 June, Portugal requested assistance through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The European Union responded swiftly and substantially. Within hours, France, Spain and Italy sent firefighting aircraft and firefighters. Greece and Cyprus also offered to send firefighters through our mechanism. I would like to warmly thank those countries. I would also like to thank the Portuguese authorities for publicly recognising and praising this EU assistance because in that way they communicated the EU solidarity to their citizens. In these critical times, it is our duty to make each citizen aware of what the European Union truly stands for.  Let me mention the specific assistance provided to Portugal via the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. Firstly, seven aircraft and 135 firefighters with 29 vehicles were sent to Portugal. Over a week, a total of 747 water drops   were carried out. In addition, 61 EU Copernicus satellite maps were produced to help assess the damage. Through the Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC), the Commission monitored the situation around the clock and was in constant contact with the Portuguese and other Member States’ authorities. The European Union stands ready to support the response to any new forest fire emergency in the EU in the coming months.  During the recent forest fire emergency Spain too asked our ERCC for Copernicus satellite maps. Emergency management services were therefore activated. As of today, 12 maps have been produced and 14 are in the making. For the 2017 forest fire season, reinforcement measures have also been taken. Our ERCC is continuously monitoring the situation across Europe and civil protection experts from our Member States, including Spain, are working on our ERCC premises in Brussels. However, the EU has no assets of its own and no firefighting planes. We rely on our Member States to make resources available. On that point, more could be done. As the Commission pointed out in February this year in its report on progress and the remaining gaps, the aerial forest firefighting capability should be further strengthened. This is a very important point.  But the EU civil protection legislation goes beyond disaster response. As you well know as parliamentarians, it also includes disaster risk management as an equal priority. The Commission has recently produced an overview of disaster risks that the EU may face, based on the work carried out by Member States in developing national risk assessments, for it is important to have a better understanding of all disaster risks in Europe, including forest fires. As the recent tragic events have sadly demonstrated, prevention is always better than cure. The Commission provides funding for prevention and preparedness projects and exercises. Apart from these activities, the means to fight forest fires in all parts of our continent are to be improved under the annual work programme of the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. In addition, the regional funds also play an important role in addressing climate change adaptation, disaster risk prevention and management, and environmental protection in all our Member States.  Portugal  and Spain  benefit from these funds, which also cover protecting people from forest fires. Added to that, both countries receive further support through the cross-border, transnational and interregional programmes with a specific focus on forest fire protection measures.

It was an unusually destructive fire, a huge catastrophe that shocked everyone immensely.

The Mediterranean forest is not a simple tree plantation.

It definitely comes at a very crucial time.  We already recognise that Europe faces numerous natural disasters; some may be predicted or anticipated while others come as a surprise. You already mentioned about the impact of the climate change, but regardless of any criticisms I would like to remind you, and myself of course, that the European Union remains the most pioneering political organisation across the world regarding climate change, and is definitely against new approaches by the new administration of the USA.  It is quite important for us to recognise this in order to show that, as Europeans, we remain very committed in this very difficult political landscape about climate change. And for this reason we must stand ready to help when there are surprises in many areas, in particular in the south of Europe. We cannot predict when forest fires will break out and when spring comes we know that sooner or later they will indeed break out. This is the destiny of some areas.  As I said, the actions taken to respond to the forest fires that broke out in Portugal in June and took so many human lives are a clear example of EU solidarity. I followed all the actions, I followed all the activities by our Member States and by our ERCC. We have here the director of this coordination centre, and I would like to say thanks for your commitment because, as I said, I followed moment by moment, minute by minute and I saw that yes, the European Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism is the manifestation of a tangible solidarity on the ground. It is very critical to recognise and to realise this in order to achieve more through this mechanism.  Definitely, the Commission will continue work to fight all emergencies, but also to prevent new ones. In fact, the work of the Commission goes well beyond pure response to disasters. We need to anticipate through our actions, to prevent future catastrophes and, as I said, prevention is better than cure. This is why we focus on prevention and preparedness. Of course a lot of other policies and actions have to be there in practice, but in our competence there is only this mechanism, and in some other areas you know from our Treaties they are national competences. It is as simple as that.  This is our structure and I think it is difficult to change this structure in this framework, particularly in the current times. In this respect I would like to stress again that the European emergency response capacity, the so-called voluntary pool, is composed of civil protection assets in expertise from our Member States that are put at the disposal of other Member States affected by a disaster. It is real example of tangible EU solidarity and this solidarity comes when it really, really matters. As the saying goes, actions speak louder than words. I am convinced that we as Europeans can be proud of putting theory into practice. We can be proud of exercising solidarity to help fellow European citizens when they need it to save lives. Improving our response capacity should be our ultimate goal for the benefit of all those who may need help one day.  Some specific answers: Mr van Nistelrooij and Mr Kelly have already spoken about our ability through the Solidarity Fund. I am sure that you know that the national authorities need to apply for this Fund’s support and provide an assessment of the damage, and then the Commission reviews the application and determines if EU support could be activated and for what amount and specifically, I think 12 weeks after. Portugal, maybe you know, has received since 2003 through this Solidarity Fund, including for the forest fires on Madeira last summer, around EUR 80 million, so the Solidarity Fund has already been activated about this request.  It is quite important to recognise that the south of Europe is more sensitive as a region for forest fires and this is why my intention as Commissioner responsible for the ERCC and the Civil Protection Mechanism is to see more improvements in our action through this mechanism, but you know that we need some new legislation or some amendments. I would like to sit together to exchange views on how to increase our cooperation and to see how this mechanism can be more effective and efficient.

First of all, I would like to thank my fellow shadow rapporteurs very much for this constructive and intensive cooperation on this report. We found good compromises. At this point and at a late hour in this House we are raising an important issue that affects many companies, but also private citizens in Europe, namely the issue of double taxation. In various committees, the main thing we have done here is to close tax loopholes, that is, to eliminate aggressive tax avoidance models because we do not accept that ordinary people pay their taxes, but large international corporations do not. At the same time, however, it is also important to this House that taxes on the same income or on the same capital do not have to be paid twice. So we do not want either double non-taxation or double taxation, and against this background we expressly welcome the initiative of the European Commission to present a legislative proposal on this. In doing so, the Commission also complied with a resolution of the European Parliament from July 2016. In it, the European Parliament stated that a clear time frame for dispute settlement mechanisms is the key to increasing the effectiveness of the current system. The arbitration convention was difficult to achieve as a compromise between the member states. It is now to be replaced by the new proposal from the European Commission. So much to praise the Commission, so much we regret that the Council, which is not present for the debate tonight, has not waited for the official approval of our report here in the European Parliament. The Council has already completed its decision-making process. At this point we want to express our displeasure bring. We believe that, even if the European Parliament does not require its consent, it would have been a matter of courtesy to wait for our deliberations to end, and we ask the Bureau of the House to express this to the Council. The main subject of the report is that we want to improve the dispute settlement procedures, which have so far been inefficient. We want to achieve legal certainty. The 10.5 billion euros - which is at issue at the moment, in over 900 cases, show that this is not a small sum, it can happen to taxpayers that they do not receive any binding information with their tax return if they are in several European countries Union operate. We want legal certainty here, we want a procedure that ensures that citizens do not have to bring long-term legal disputes at high costs. It is therefore good that there is a specific proposal that now obliges the Member States to set up a dispute settlement procedure for their citizens. Personally, I would have liked to have set up a permanent committee here, so that experts from the tax administrations would have been permanently assigned by the Member States. Unfortunately, the other groups were unable to make up their minds on this, but at least we have submitted a joint proposal which means that the deadlines that are now contained in the Council proposal should be significantly reduced again: one year instead of two years, six instead of one year Months. So we want the citizen to receive information more quickly as to whether his complaint will be accepted at all and whether it is justified. Because we consider it completely unacceptable if taxpayers and companies have to wait for years until they receive an explanation as to whether their complaint against double taxation is legally binding or not - so here is a complete one a clear plea for legal certainty and transparency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 427, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Christos STYLIANIDES", "mepid": "124688", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, on behalf of my dear colleague Pierre Moscovici, I would like to thank the rapporteur, the shadow rapporteurs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) for their high-quality report and their very constructive and comprehensive work on the Directive on Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanisms. This directive is yet another building block in the Commission’s action towards a fairer, more efficient, more competitive and at the same time, more transparent corporate tax system in the EU. Whilst proposing stricter rules against tax avoidance and ensuring that taxes are paid where profits are generated, the Commission is also very much concerned about providing legal certainty for taxpayers and ensuring that when they operate cross-border they pay taxes on their income and capital only once, not twice. Double taxation occurs when two or more countries claim the right to tax the same income or profits of a company. There are estimated to be around 900 double taxation disputes ongoing in the EU today between Member States, under the current dispute resolution mechanisms, mainly dealing with transfer pricing issues. Double taxation is a serious obstacle to cross-border investment in our single market, leading to uncertainty and discouraging cross-border trade. Under the existing procedures, unresolved double taxation disputes between Member States represents EUR 10 billion in the EU. From an investor’s perspective, robust, reliable and stable procedures and predictable behaviour on the part of tax administrations as regards eliminating double taxation are important factors for doing business in a country. To remedy the current situation, the directive provides for mandatory and binding dispute resolution mechanisms with clear timelines and an obligation to reach results. It significantly improves the existing mechanisms for resolving disputes between Member States. The text allows for a ‘mutual agreement procedure’ to be initiated by the taxpayer, under which Member States must reach an agreement within a set deadline. If the procedure fails, an arbitration procedure is launched to resolve the dispute within specified timelines. The directive is also a direct response to the calls of this House included, for example, in the ECON resolution from December 2015, known as TAXE, and its TAXE II resolution of July 2016. ECON’s report highlights some key elements of efficiency and effectiveness, such as setting ambitious timelines, ensuring independence of the members of the arbitration commission, deciding on disputed cases and enhancing transparency. As regards timelines, setting up ambitious time limits had to be balanced against the international environment and the procedures set out in tax treaties. Other elements, such as the increased number of cases, fostering the capacities of tax administration, as well as business realities and the global tax environment, involving more complicated and sophisticated cases, were also considered. As far as independence of the members of the arbitration commission is concerned, the Commission recognises the high importance of the issue. That is why we are fully committed to ensuring the right balance between the criteria of independence and integrity towards competence of the independent person, given the increased complexity and sophistication of the cases involved. With regard to increasing transparency, the publication of a summary of each decision on disputed cases, is regarded as highly beneficial. Furthermore, the Commission has also ensured that taxpayers’ rights and obligations throughout the procedure are significantly improved. Finally, the directive ensures that the mechanisms do not result in double non-taxation situations. If the affected taxpayer cannot prove that there is double taxation, Member States can decide to deny access to the procedure. I count on Parliament’s full support for this important file, so that we can continue delivering our ambitious agenda for a competitive and growth-driven tax environment; full speed ahead! The most crucial imminent steps in this regard are: the introduction of a common consolidated corporate tax base (CCCTB). The CCCTB is exactly the fair, efficient and competitive corporate tax system that the EU desperately needs – now and for the future. First, because the CCCTB will create a simpler, more stable and more attractive environment for businesses and investors inside Europe. Second, it will encourage growth-friendly business activities and will boost the competitiveness of the EU as a whole. And finally, the CCCTB will make corporate taxation fairer and more efficient.

Because we all know that the problem is that large companies do not pay taxes; and not that they pay them in two countries. We consider secrecy to be out of place in international tax cases, and publication is in the general interest. That is why we have tabled amendments in this regard. It is not understandable that a company has up to three years to claim an alleged case of double taxation and that, however, the State has only one year to examine this case. We need to give more time and resources to the tax inspectors, who are like David before the Goliath of the big corporations. Finally, we reject the idea of ​​guaranteeing impunity for tax crimes when there are open double taxation disputes. This is inadmissible. Let's stop being hypocritical.

You said it, Madam President: on May 16, the ECJ ruled on the Commission's question as to whether and how a trade agreement should be ratified, which competence lies with the European Union and which competence lies with the Member States. The saying is pretty straightforward - almost everything is EU competence: services, transport services, intellectual property issues, of course market opening, public procurement and also the issue of sustainability and workers' rights. The ECJ has said that workers' rights are an integral part of trade agreements. I found that very gratifying. He has excluded two things as national competence: the question of investments - if they are very comprehensive, portfolio investments - and investment dispute settlement mechanisms, especially if they do not exhaust national legal systems. It actually becomes clear what it's about. And now 50 days have passed and I have not yet heard from the European Commission. It is important to know how our partners should actually adjust to this and, of course, how citizens should adjust to who has to make trade policy decisions and how in the future. The commission is playing a submarine, they go into hiding. There are actually clear options that can be discussed. One option is: We will continue as before, with all the problems associated with it, as we experienced in the discussion about the Canada Agreement CETA, with many faults and many ambiguities up to a process that lasted several years Ratification will take time. Do we want that? I really don't think so. Or the second option: You separate the commercial part with the elements that I have just outlined - where the Court of Justice said that this is EU competence - from an investment agreement, which is then mixed Is responsible and must be ratified by the EU member states and their parliaments. So two agreements. That gives clarity. And the process is also transparent, efficient and fast. Or you can also say: If the criteria of the European Court of Justice are such that only direct investments are EU jurisdiction, then portfolio investments are simply left out, and if it is the case that an investment court only comes under EU jurisdiction if all national investments If legal remedies have been exhausted, then you make it mandatory, i.e. meet the requirements of the European Court of Justice and pack that into an agreement. That would also be a possibility. I think we really have to have that on the table by now, which options we actually want to pursue. I tend towards the middle one - that is, to separate this - but that has to be discussed. And then I would like to know from the Commission what they have been thinking over the past 50 days. Because this is not an abstract idea, Madam President, Commissioner, but just today there was political agreement on the Japan Agreement, where this question comes up again. Then there are negotiations with Mexico, Mercosur and Chile, etc. I believe that the partners need to be clear, and our citizens in particular need to be clear.

About the many questions raised by my colleague, the Commission sought the opinion of the European Court of Justice on the EU-Singapore Free Trade Agreement, to obtain clarity about the division of competences on trade and investment and to check if the EU could sign and conclude the FTA alone.  The Court’s opinion provided this clarity in an unequivocal manner. Therefore, we have now a unique opportunity to put the governance of the EU trade policy on a more stable and effective footing, allowing the EU to remain a credible negotiating partner that can better deliver for citizens. Our objective is outlined in the Reflection Paper on Harnessing Globalisation according to which ‘the EU must be able not only to negotiate broad agreements to tackle a wide range of global issues, but also to ensure these agreements can be ratified and implemented’. Let me now proceed to your specific questions as already understood. The Court confirmed that the EU has exclusive competence for most matters that were included in the Singapore FTA, such as: trade in goods; trade in services, including transport; government procurement; intellectual property; competition; trade and sustainable development; Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) liberalisation, and the substantive standards of protection for FDI.  The Court concluded that the competence is shared with the Member States for only two areas. First, non-direct investment, and second, Investor-to-State Dispute Settlement (ISDS) with regard to both direct and non-direct foreign investments. Therefore, and despite the majority of the agreement being considered as coming under the EU’s exclusive competence and the remaining parts as shared competence, the Court considered that the agreement as it stands cannot be concluded by the EU alone. This means that unless the FTA is modified, it cannot be ratified as EU-only, but would need to be presented as a mixed agreement and ratified by all national and, where appropriate, regional parliaments. The opinion gives us an opportunity to look afresh jointly with this House, the Council of course, and Member States, at ways to make EU decision-making for trade and investment policy more sound and efficient. This discussion will need to take into account the legal and political implications deriving from the Court’s opinion: in particular, we will need to respond to the questions as to whether we consider that the status quo, meaning a similar ratification process as in the case of the FTA with Canada (CETA) is sustainable, or not. Or should we rather use the clarity provided by this opinion to move to a more credible and efficient ratification process, taking into account that the EU has exclusive competence for the full scope of our new generation progressive trade and investment agreements but not for certain elements of investment protection and ISDS? How can we best respect the allocation of competences while presenting trade and investment agreements that are coherent and maximise the benefits for citizens? Last but not least, we will need to explain collectively that, whatever path may be chosen, the EU’s trade and investment policy decision-making process is, and will continue to be, a fully democratic one by the European Parliament and the representatives from the democratically elected governments of the Member States in the Council. Further to the proposals and actions made by the Commission to enhance the transparency of trade negotiations and to ensure the proper involvement of all stakeholders during the negotiations, we are keen to explore further ways to assist the Member States in strengthening the involvement of national parliaments early on in the process.  Once our exchanges produce more clarity and consensus on these matters, we will be in a position to propose concrete steps related to the distinction between EU exclusive and shared competences in the ratification process of our free-trade agreements and the negotiating mandates that will be needed for future FTAs.

EU trade policy has been in crisis for the past year. The idea that the trade agreements we conclude should not only be approved here in the European Parliament and by all Member States, but also approved in 38 national and regional parliaments around Europe, has made the EU impossible as a serious negotiating partner with many of our major negotiating partners around the world. This was something that Canada learned the hard way: When Canadian Trade Minister Freeman cried, literally, left Wallonia after the Social Democratic government there, representing 3.5 million in a Belgian region, refused to accept the EU-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and then 500 million Europeans and 35 million Canadians refused to harvest free trade fruits, jobs and growth. The whole basic idea is that we polarize sovereignty, that we exchange independent decision-making for real influence and better decisions, and right now we are fighting to do just that in the area of ​​migration policy. By the same logic. But precisely trade policy, where we have had the idea of ​​joint decision-making since the Treaty of Rome in 1947 and the establishment of the customs union, and now not defending joint decision-making, it will have an extremely high price. Because it is the beginning to the end of what has been the basis of European cooperation for 60 years. And that 3.5 million Europeans in Wallonia will prevent Sweden and all other European countries from harvesting free trade fruits, I will never be able to explain to my citizens, because all Europeans are losing out on that system. But to do something about this, we need courage. Courage from the Commission to dare to propose trade agreements, pure trade agreements, as EU expertise. But even more courage is needed, I think, from politicians. In particular, from the Member States to defend free trade, to defend joint decision-making and to stand up for the trade agreements we have negotiated, and not to spread myths about them.

Apart from the damage that has done to us as trade negotiators, my fear about this is that it is not actually going to bring any more clarity to the situation than we had before the court case. I am afraid that nothing the Commissioner has said tonight has given me hope that this would be different. The logical consequence of the court ruling should be to leave investment out of the Singapore Free Trade Agreement and proceed as quickly as possible with a goods-only agreement. That could be ratified very speedily and it would also take a toxic matter out of the agreement. I hope that the Council, which should have been part of this debate tonight, will actually agree with this and take the matter forward but, as the committee Chair has said, this goes beyond the Singapore Free Trade Agreement. The Commission has done this, and I pleased to hear that. The Lisbon Treaty makes it very clear that this House, which is legitimately elected by the EU citizens, is the only Parliament entitled to ratify EU—only free trade deals. In future, the Council should not artificially add to the mandate for free trade agreements in order to maintain mixity. Secondly, as Mr Fjellner has said, by not doing this, we can avoid the potential scenario of any one of 43 national and regional parliaments holding our trade agreements hostage. The Court has given us a unique opportunity to put new impetus into our trade agreements. I think a majority in this House is willing to grasp that nettle. I am not yet convinced that the Commission is, and I am very worried that we have had radio silence from the European Council on this matter.

I know she is finalising the EU-Japan Free Trade Agreement (FTA). This is very good news for Europe. The EU must accelerate on trade deals now that the USA has decided the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) is not a priority. With regard to Singapore, I was and am a very strong supporter of this FTA, as I really believe it offers a win-win commercial deal. I am as frustrated as our Singapore counterparts that this FDA has taken so long and that it was stuck in court for such a long time. As our oral question points out, negotiations were launched in March 2010. Seven years, colleagues, is a positively biblical cycle. If we take so long with a rule-of-law country like Singapore, imagine how long we will take with bigger, more problematic countries. The Court of Justice ruling of 16 May 2017 places almost all the EU-Singapore FTA provisions within the exclusive competence of the Union. However, the two remaining areas of mixed competence have a clear effect and will probably constitute a precedent for future FTAs that the EU will negotiate.  Europe will grow not with more public debt but rather through further trade deals with countries all over the world. Time is always important, and now there is a favourable international momentum for Europeans to grasp. I want to raise three questions. What will the consequences of this Court ruling be beyond the ratification of this FTA? Can we expect the ratification next year? What will be the consequences in terms of future mandates for the negotiation of FTAs and the procedures for their ratification?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 444, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Anne-Marie MINEUR", "mepid": "125037", "text": "on behalf of the GUE / NGL Group. - The judgment of the European Court of Justice was a bit disappointing.

Two weeks ago I had the pleasure of meeting their Trade Minister here, also their Ambassador to the European Union, and last weekend in Dublin I met the Ambassador to Ireland.

Although we have an interest in concluding these discussions as soon as possible, we are aware that, due to their legal and political complexities, they may require time. It is clear that we have the same objective. We all want to make the EU’s trade and investment policy to be more stable, effective and credible for the benefit of our EU citizens. Our analysis and discussions apply to all trade agreements that have not been ratified yet. This also includes free-trade agreements with Vietnam and Singapore.  We are considering all options that could strengthen the EU’s trade and investment policy, but we do not want to prejudge the outcome of this process before having properly discussed it with this House, Member States and other stakeholders. We are therefore looking forward to further exchanges on these issues with the European Parliament. This is a difficult position for me as I hold a different portfolio, but this is the Commission position.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 450, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": "- Author!I think the last word has not yet been spoken in this debate.That closes the debate.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 451, "date": "2017-07-05.json", "name": "Paloma LÓPEZ BERMEJO", "mepid": "125047", "text": "written.- Despite what the text of the question suggests, the CJEU ruling has serious consequences for the Commission's \"new\" trade agenda and its claim to implement free trade agreements without the unanimous authorization of the Member States.This represents a victory for democracy against the attempt to impose ISDS (arbitration tribunals between multinationals and States) and regulatory \"cooperation\" mechanisms as legislative actors against national courts and parliaments.A victory, therefore, against those who are promoting new trade agreements (such as the ACS and the ATCI) to deregulate the European economy, instead of submitting their proposals to the popular vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}]
