Signor Presidente, so che dopo una campagna elettorale così combattuta Lei saprà fare del suo meglio per continuare l'ottimo lavoro fatto dal suo predecessore Martin Schulz, che ha alzato di molto la rilevanza e la visibilità di questa Istituzione. Sono certo che, come ha saputo fare negli altri ruoli da Lei ricoperti e come ha già detto, Lei darà il massimo durante questo periodo delicato per la nostra Europa. Le assicuro che la Presidenza maltese di questo semestre europeo sarà un interlocutore leale e un lavoratore assiduo per portare a casa i risultati prefissati. Complimenti di nuovo a Lei e ai candidati. Sur President, nistqarr li dan huwa mument emozzjonali għalija: l-aħħar darba li dħalt fil-plenarja disa’ snin ilu kien bħala Membru ta’ din il-Kamra. Dak iż-żmien, flimkien ma’ Louis Grech, li llum li huwa d-Deputat Prim Ministru tiegħi, u oħrajn, konna mal-ewwel grupp ta’ parlamentari Ewropej ġejjin minn pajjiżi li, dak iż-żmien, kienu jissejħu Stati Membri ġodda.  Kien hawn arja ta’ eċċitament u ottimiżmu kbir f’din l-istituzzjoni u madwar l-Ewropa kollha. L-inkwiet tagħna kien dwar kif nistgħu nkabbru aktar l-ekonomija; kif nistgħu nlaħħqu mal-Aġenda 2020; kif se nipproteġu lill-konsumaturi tagħna aktar; kif nistgħu mmexxu lill-Ewropa aktar ’il quddiem. Ftit kienu qed jobsru li ġejja kriżi finanzjarja, kriżi finanzjarja dinjija li kienet se tissagrifika tant postijiet tax-xogħol. Ħadd ma kien jippretendi li banek b’saħħithom se jkollhom jispiċċaw jiġu salvati mill-flus ta’ min iħallas it-taxxi. Ftit kienu qed jistennew li se jkollna taħdidiet biex Stat Membru jiġi salvat mill-falliment. Kważi ħadd ma kien jistenna li se jkollna nibdew taħdidiet biex wieħed minna jitlaq. Kif kien ikun hawn ħafna tbissim meta konna nkunu ftit ħafna li nitkellmu dwar il-kriżi tal-immigrazzjoni, li dak iż-żmien kienet għadha meqjusa bħala problema Mediterranja u mhux problema Ewropea.  Dak iż-żmien ukoll kien ikolli żewġ minuti (xi drabi ħamsa) biex nitkellem - illum għandi ftit iktar minn hekk, u se nipprova nuża dan il-privileġġ bl-aħjar mod. Naf li ħafna minnkom diġà qraw il-programm tal-Presidenza Maltija li, b’intenzjoni, flimkien mal-ħbieb tagħna Olandiżi u Slovakki, huwa ffukat ħafna. Għas-sitt xhur li ġejjin għażilna li niffukaw fuq sitt setturi: l-immigrazzjoni, is-suq waħdieni, is-sigurtà, l-inklużjoni soċjali, il-viċinat tal-Ewropa u s-settur marittimu. Se nagħżel li, minflok ngħid ftit sentenzi fuq kull qasam, se niffoka fuq uħud minnhom u lil hinn minnhom, u niġbed ftit tagħlimiet minn dawn il-paralleli ta’ kif inbidlet l-Ewropa u d-dinja f’dan id-deċennju; u l-arja li kien hawn dakinhar, u l-arja li hawn illum f’din il-Plenarja u madwar l-istituzzjonijiet Ewropej u, fuq kollox, fejn veru jgħodd, fid-djar tal-familji ta’ madwar l-Ewropa kollha. Ovvjament, wara nkun lest li nwieġeb għall-mistoqsijiet tagħkom fuq l-oqsma kollha.  I believe we should start with migration. We know for a fact that there is a need for a holistic policy, which has gone amiss for many years and has only recently been recognised as a priority. I must say that the Commission has shown exceptional leadership in this – as has Parliament – and I have to admit that any hesitation is coming from the institution I represent here today. I will not waste your time by repeating the clichés that have been going round for so long: on the need to use all our policies, including development aid and a long-term approach. We all know that, and we all agree with that – also thanks to decisions taken during the Valletta Summit a little over a year ago, which have given new impetus to the external dimension and led to the negotiation of a number of compacts, which are the basis for such a long—term approach.  But the issue is much more pressing, and time is not on our side. You know Malta’s position on this issue very well. We have been stressing for more than a decade that the migration situation in the Mediterranean is unsustainable. We were among the first to sow the seeds – even within this Parliament – on the need for responsibility sharing, and also the sharing of the burden of managing the flows that cannot fall exclusively on the shoulders of front—line Member States. Yet for many years we were left almost alone, trying to overcome a crisis which was not of our making. The only solution we were given – and even that only at times – was some more money. But that is not a solution. I confess that, when last year we came to take sides in the Council on the distribution mechanism proposed by the Commission, there were quite a few voices back home urging me to stand against the relocation of migrants. They said that nobody helped us when we needed it. We took our fair share over the years, so now let us mind our own business. I assure you that such a stand would have been very popular and would have had a popular backing within the silent majority. Instead, we opted to do just the opposite, because we know that this is an issue of principles and credibility. Solidarity is not an à la carte option that we use when we need it and turn a blind eye to when others need it. Solidarity is an essential European value at the very core of what the founding mothers and fathers envisaged 60 years ago in Rome. So the smallest Member State, which over the years – bar the last few – has suffered first—hand the brunt of the human plight of migration with little or no help, signed up to take asylum seekers from other Member States which are facing a crisis. To me, that is more than enough to assert that our European and human values are indisputable.  I was sorry to see a minority of Member States resist this system. During these next six months we can choose to dig our heels in further and antagonise each other even more, or, on the other hand, we can try to understand any genuine concerns and misgivings that these Member States – and indeed our people in our own Member States – have about the whole way in which Europe is handling the migration issue. We have opted for a two—pronged approach which focuses on the effective management of our borders while concurrently working to achieve progress on the fairer allocation of responsibility and – to be very clear – the fair allocation of the burden, since we are now used to calling it that. The proper management of our land and – more problematically – sea borders is part and parcel of our approach towards a revision of the Dublin Regulation, which needs to be an ambitious and workable solution. The last major crisis we had caught Europe unprepared, also because the situation was rendered even more critical by our own inadequate and dated European systems and procedures. In fact, these flaws were exposed in their entirety. All this led to tensions on different approaches – ‘to wall, or not to wall?’ In the end, the only way in which the flow was stemmed was through an agreement with Turkey. We all know it is not a perfect deal, and that it is not a long—term solution, but we have to admit that this is what has made some difference up to now. Europe cannot be caught in this conundrum once again. Come next spring, Europe will face a new heavy influx of migrants – this time through the central Mediterranean. Needless to say, their composition, their origin and the reasons why these people want to undergo the riskiest voyage of their life across a deadly sea is different from that of the mainly Syrian refugees crossing the Aegean Sea. We also all know that the countries across the southern littoral of the central Mediterranean are different in so many ways from Turkey. Nevertheless, in my mind there is no doubt that, unless the essence of the Turkey deal is replicated in the central Mediterranean, Europe will face a major migration crisis. Let me not mince my words: I see no way in which one single Member State can manage or absorb this further wave. Thus, the essence of the core principles of the European Union will be seriously tested unless we act now. Let me also be very clear about what I mean by the replication of the ‘essence’ of the Turkey deal. I mean, most importantly, breaking the business model of the criminal gangs making millions of euros out of this inhumane business. I believe that a strong political message is necessary at this point, and if we manage to get such an agreement, we should then, as the European Union, organise humanitarian safe passages and corridors that would get recognised asylum seekers to Europe safely.  (Applause) One final point on migration: I have no doubt that, unless we are ready to make such bold moves, we will be made to make even bolder ones in the months to come, and these citizens will be led by people who do not have the progress of the European project at heart. This is a matter which we intend to tackle directly during the meeting of the Heads of State and Government in Malta next month. I said that I would not go into each and every priority of the Presidency, but I cannot give this address without specifically mentioning the priority of security. The European Union is meant to deliver an area of freedom, security and justice for its citizens. Our citizens need to feel safe and protected wherever they are within Europe. In recent times, we have seen a direct threat to that security. We have learned, at our own cost, that the security of one Member State is the security of another. If we are not together, we are extremely vulnerable. Strengthening our resilience to protect our way of life is a common responsibility, and therefore taking cooperation in this area to a different level is not an option. Member States and institutions need to work relentlessly to deliver a safe Europe for citizens. A lot has been done in recent months, but a lot more needs to be done and our efforts need to increase, because time really is of the essence. The Maltese Presidency will work hand—in—hand with you, Parliament, to address this common challenge with determination.  Allow me now to take some time to discuss Brexit. It is quite a historic irony for a country that has been a British colony for two centuries, and which currently also presides over the Commonwealth, to hold the Presidency of the Council of the European Union at the time of the triggering of the process by means of which the United Kingdom will, unfortunately, cease to be a member of the European Union which it supported us to join. Given our historical ties and the great – and mostly positive – influence that the British systems had on our own, from the basis of our educational and administrative systems to English, which is one of our two official languages; from the George Cross for the bravery shown by our forefathers during the Second World War, which we proudly display on our flag, to the side of the road on which we drive, this is not a happy event for us.  We want a fair deal for the United Kingdom, but that deal necessarily needs to be inferior to membership. This should not come as a surprise to anyone. Indeed, thinking it can be otherwise would indicate a detachment from reality. Yesterday’s statement by my colleague and friend, Prime Minister May, helps clarify the priorities of the British Government during the impending negotiations. Our understanding is that Prime Minister May is prioritising curbs to freedom of movement of people over membership of the single market and the customs union. She added that she does not want the United Kingdom to replicate something that exists, but rather the creation of something new. I would like to confirm to this House today that, at this point, there is unequivocal unity within Council. This stand does not arise from antagonism, but from belief in the core principles of the European project. As stated by the 27 heads of state and government after the Brexit referendum result, which we respect as a sovereign decision, the freedom of movement of persons, goods, services and capital cannot be decoupled. To put it simply, the four freedoms are indivisible.  (Applause) Indeed, the fact that the British Prime Minister declared that she will take her country out of the single market because of the political choice to limit the freedom of movement of persons confirms the position of the EU 27 that the four freedoms are one package. That, in itself, is a somewhat positive development. This is not to say that we should allow these principles to be abused or undermined. The freedom of movement of persons is aimed at allowing people to move freely across the Member States, to work and establish themselves and their families freely. It was never meant to encourage people to shop around Member States to see who offers the best social benefits. This is why we look forward to Commission proposals in this area. Once there is a notification, a clear and clean cut from current arrangements, and afterwards a negotiated and unrelated new free-trade agreement ushered in by possible transitional agreements where European rules and institutions cannot be compromised, will be an arduous task, as our recent experiences in trade agreements suggest. This task should never be underestimated. Nor should our colleagues on the other side of the table be underestimated. I would like to report to you how the Council intends to go about the mechanics of Brexit. First of all, we will keep to the maxim that there will be absolutely no negotiations without the official notification. Once the notification is made, depending on the contents of such a notification, consultations will start amongst Member States with the intention of convening an extraordinary European Council meeting within a short period of time – possibly four to five weeks from notification – with the aim of establishing the guidelines that will serve as a mandate to the Commission to negotiate. I also want to take this opportunity to say that I am very impressed with the thorough preparations that Michel Barnier and his team are making. The Commission will be asked to refer back to the Council as appropriate. The General Affairs Council will be tasked with the preparation of the Council’s work. This leads me to the role of Parliament in all this. As already publicly stated, I advocate that Parliament should be involved as much as possible in this process.  (Applause) Having been part of this institution myself, I am aware of the organic dynamics within it. I am of the opinion that not involving Parliament is not the best choice. It comes with its own risks, and would also lead to the risk of even the fairest of deals being scuttled. Having said this, I do appeal to all institutions to adopt a consistent approach that is aimed at safeguarding the European project and not at punishing any particular country. Before closing, I would like to pinpoint a further element which is present in the narrative and the programme of the Maltese Presidency: the social factor. I believe that the social aspect of this 60-year-old project is the essence of our European Union.  (Applause)  It is an ethos that no other group of nations can say is theirs. It is a characteristic that no trade deal can ever aspire to replicate. Indeed, social Europe is the X factor of the European Union: you either have it or you don’t. This is why we want these six months to lead the drive towards a strengthening of this ideal, which can go a long way towards contributing to the real question that families across our continent are asking, and the experiences that they go through each and every day of their lives. Social Europe should not be treated as a concept belonging to the 90s, but rather as a unique European essence, the real scope behind projects such as the single market and the euro. The fact that we have not pursued this goal actively over the past few years may provide an explanation for the current mood in many of our Member States. So we are proud to put social Europe back on the agenda, in sync with the Commission’s recent work.  (Applause) I strongly believe that matching this dimension with policies conducive to economic growth and more – and better – jobs can help provide a guiding light not only to our people, but also to the global community that is desperately looking for progressive leadership. Sur President, hemm bosta suġġetti oħra li xtaqt nitkellem dwarhom u nittama li jkolli ċans nitkellem dwarhom fi tweġiba għall-interventi tal-kollegi: fost l-oħrajn is-suq waħdieni, il-qasam tat-tassazzjoni, id-dinamiċi interistituzzjonali, l-ambjent u l-klima, il-qasam marittimu, ir-road map ta’ Bratislava, is-Sittin Anniversarju tat-Trattat ta’ Ruma, fuq kollox - kif għidt diġà - l-aspett soċjali.

I have known you for centuries, I know you are a convinced European and I am sure and certain that you will exercise your new profession with the elegance and know-how that have always characterized you. (Applause) I would like, just as warmly, to pay tribute to Martin Schulz, neither for the first nor for the last time. He was a great President of this Parliament and Europe owes him a lot. Martin Schulz is a great European. Coming from the smallest founding country of the Union, I am also delighted that Malta, our smallest of our Member States, is for the first time taking the reins of the Union Presidency. When I am in Malta I always tell Joseph, Louise and my Maltese friends that the day Malta became a member of the European Union was a happy day for me, because on that day Luxembourg ceased to be the smallest Member State of the Union. Therefore, I was spontaneously in favor of Malta joining. I welcome Malta's presence and its assumption of the Presidency of the Council of Ministers because I know that European engagement is not proportional to the size of countries and that the smallest often make the largest presidencies. Not wanting to defend their immediate interests, they generally have great ambitions for Europe. And ambition, we need it more than ever to revive our economies, to face the migratory wave, to face the terrorist threat, to find the right way to react to the decision of the United Kingdom to choose Brexit and to prepare our relations with Donald Trump's America. I welcome the clarifications made yesterday by the British Prime Minister. Last night I told him that a speech alone does not trigger negotiations. As soon as the United Kingdom activates Article 50, an unprecedented negotiation will begin, which should be completed in two years according to the treaty and whose consequences will be considerable for this country, for its 27 partners and for the European Union as a whole. For my part, I will do everything to ensure that this negotiation leads to a balanced solution in full compliance with our rules. Most of you, most politicians, most of our citizens and, perhaps more than all, the Commission, which I have the honor to chair, would have liked Europe to respond more quickly and More solidarity with the events which sadly marked the year 2016. Often our hesitations, sometimes our divisions, played into the hands of the extremists and Europhobes who hastened to hold the European Union responsible for all the evils. I want to affirm, here and now, that they are mistaken and, more seriously, that they are misleading those to whom they make believe that the withdrawal into oneself, the closing of the borders, the rejection of the asylum seekers constitute solutions . It is quite the opposite. We must say clearly and above all prove to those who think that the time has come to deconstruct the Union, to tear it apart, to divide us, that they are completely wrong. Without the Union, no Member State would be able to welcome asylum seekers, fight terrorism, organize our economy, fight unemployment and influence world affairs. (Applause) The Maltese Presidency can count on the support of the Commission so that, all together, we ensure that the celebrations of the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, prepared by the - no less important - Malta summit in February, not only consecrate our past advances but also and above all mark a new beginning, a burst of energy, clairvoyance, vision to initiate a re-founding of Europe which will thus prove, as has always been the case in its history, that it emerges strengthened from trials and challenges. To achieve this, we can have confidence in Malta, a bridge between the East, Africa and the West, which will use this experience as a builder to convince our different public opinions, sometimes antagonistic, to overcome national selfishness and regain the momentum and solidarity that will allow us to be even more effective in our efforts to stabilize our economies in Europe. More than once, in recent years, I have regretted that solidarity was not always a spontaneous reflex and I regret that, for the first time in European history, some countries have not implemented the decisions adopted in a field as sensitive as that of asylum, even if significant progress has been made elsewhere. We still have a lot to do, in particular to put in place a permanent European mechanism allowing us to manage migration in a credible and long-term way. To achieve this, the Commission has proposed to reform the Dublin rules by establishing a clear, predictable and fair system to help front-line countries in the event of a massive influx of refugees, and also by transforming the European Support Office into a matters of asylum, which has its headquarters in Valletta, as a genuine European Union agency for asylum. Mr President, I am making a solemn appeal here to everyone, and in particular to Parliament and the Council, to succeed in concluding the reform of the Dublin mechanism under the Maltese presidency because time is running out. I would also like the new European agency for asylum to become operational with the same speed as the one which allowed us to create the European body of border and coast guards because it is a question of credibility and l honor of Europe, which must protect its borders while by leading a human and united migration policy. It will thus oppose an indisputable denial to those who try to make their ideas flourish by engaging in a dangerous amalgamation between refugees and terrorists. Herr President, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Die Bürger sorgen sich natürlich um ihre Sicherheit. Sie setzen auf den Kampf gegen den Terror, vor Allem nach den furchtbaren und feigen Attentaten in Deutschland, Frankreich und Belgien. Deshalb müssen wir genauer wissen, wer unsere Grenzen passiert. Wir müssen besser überwachen können, wann und wie sich potenzielle Terroristen bewegen. Dafür müssen wir auch die Bewegungen sämtlicher Reisenden systematisch kontrollieren, die unsere Grenzen ohne Visa überqueren. Ich hoffe, dass unser Vorschlag dazu bis zum Ende der maltesischen Präsidentschaft Wirklichkeit wird. Die andere Priorität der Bürger ist Arbeitsplätze und Wirtschaftswachstum. Auch in dieser Frage müssen wir schnell konkrete Ergebnisse liefern, um ihr Vertrauen wiederzugewinnen. Das schaffen wir, indem wir Hemmnisse abbauen und so neue Arbeitsplätze schaffen sowie unser volles wirtschaftliches Potenzial entfalten. Die maltesische Ratspräsidentschaft unterstützt unser Vorhaben, den Binnenmarkt zu vollenden, free wir vor Allem den digitalen und den Energie-Binnenmarkt ausbauen. Außerdem eröffnen wir kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen den Zugang zur Kapitalmarktunion, sodass sie zusätzliche Finanzquellen erschließen können und nicht allein vom Bankensektor abhängig sind. Wir möchten die Investitionsoffensive, die wir gestartet haben, auch möglichst vielen kleinen und mittelständischen Unternehmen zugute kommen lassen. Sie sind es, die Arbeitsplätze von morgen schaffen. Deshalb appelliere ich an Sie, noch vor Ende des maltesischen Semesters die Ausweitung des Investitionsplans zu verabschieden. Ich bin froh darüber, dass für die maltesische Ratspräsidentschaft zu den wirtschaftspolitischen Prioritäten auch die sozialen dazugehören. Das ist ein Anliegen, das uns gleichermaßen wichtig ist. Fairness und soziale Gerechtigkeit liegen mir in all meinem politischen Handeln am Herzen. Für mich ist die soziale Dimension unerlässlich für das Gleichgewicht und die Glaubwürdigkeit unseres europäischen Projekts. (Beifall) Wir müssen der Sozialpolitik deshalb den Platz einräumen, den sie verdient, insbesondere free wir eine gemeinsame europäische Basis der sozialen Rechte verankern. Es geht dabei um nichts weniger als darum, das europäische Modell zu bewahren und zu verteidigen - das Modell einer sozialen Marktwirtschaft, die mit ihren Regeln alle und besonders die am wenigsten Begünstigten schützt; eine soziale Marktwirtschaft also, die verhindert, dass die Ungerechtigkeit wächst - und die ist im Wachsen -, und die dafür sorgt, dass die Schwächsten nicht auf der Strecke bleiben. Mr President, when Malta joined us in 2004, it opened the Union to the open sea by strengthening its maritime vocation. Thirteen years later, Malta acceded for the first time to the presidency of the Council, at a moment, it is true, crucial for Europe which must choose between recovery and disintegration by taking back its destiny in hand and by renewing its spirit of the founding fathers. This is how much we need a good captain who knows how to stay the course. I know Malta will show the way, but I call on everyone, and in particular Parliament, without which nothing is possible, to be responsible for 2017 to breathe new life into Europe and a vision for the future. thanks to projects without which it will not survive and without which its citizens, and especially young people, will turn their backs on us.

A warm welcome, as a former colleague all the more welcome to your old place of work in the European Parliament! We have a basic debate here: namely, in the European Parliament there are these right-wing politicians over there who claim that if we make Europe the nations would lose influence, the nations would become superfluous, the nations would be dissolved. I believe that the start of the Maltese Presidency today is a symbol of the opposite: that a country like Malta, a small country like Malta, with membership in Europe is great, has strength, has the ability to assert itself and can bring its interests to bear at European level . We therefore welcome your presidency - an important political signal. The priorities are set correctly: First, the migration. Spring is approaching - we all want together that the dying that we have to experience every year in the Mediterranean does not repeat itself, that it is contained as much as possible! For this we need concrete steps. A request that we as parliamentarians always have when a Council Presidency presents itself is: Please also take care of the implementation of what has been decided. In Valletta, for example, an Africa fund worth EUR 1.8 billion was decided, and the Member States - you - have now paid in EUR 80 million. Four percent of the promised money has now been paid in. What we are seeing is a tragedy: many commitments and no delivery by the Member States. Take care of that! And we have to end the blockade on the question of solidarity in Europe and finally find the right balance between helping and fighting illegal migration. We want to work on the fight against terrorism - you have it addressed. We need more enforcement, more implementation. The deficits are obvious: After every terrorist attack - in Paris, in Brussels and also in Berlin - the interior ministers meet and complain that the data exchange is not working, that we are not making any progress with the data exchange. That is why we are in favor of having a special committee address this issue in Parliament, that we should examine the background. We must finally put an end to the fact that citizens are not being sufficiently protected because the data exchange is not working. This is an issue where citizens are demanding more Europe - more Europe, more security. A third topic is the catchphrase of fairness and justice on this continent: The fact that some corporations do not pay taxes and that the craftsmen have to foot the bill - that is not possible. And if we then take Panama with us, the issue of tax havens that we briefly discussed today, then I would ask you to take care of this issue. Our societies demand justice. And last but not least, I would like to mention that we will also be voting on an important topic - for more jobs - in the coming weeks. If we want to create jobs on this continent, if we want to give the younger generation, especially in the south of the continent, a future, then we have to be open to a modern trade policy. We will vote on CETA. And I would like to express my thanks that a socialist government, a left-wing government in Malta is clearly committed to CETA, is clearly committed to CETA, that we are making progress on this issue. I may touch on one subject, a purely technical one, but one that is important for us as parliamentarians: I ask you to prepare for the 2019 elections. We are working on a European electoral law and we finally need movement in the European Council, in the Council of Ministers so that we can move forward on electoral law and have a stable legislative base to hold the 2019 elections.We wish you much success!Europe needs the compromise, needs cooperation: the EPP is ready for this.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 24, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Maria João RODRIGUES", "mepid": "124737", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to welcome the Prime Minister and welcome the Maltese Presidency. You are starting your Presidency in a very challenging context, with Europe being surrounded by many sources of tension and, with the Putin effect on the one hand and the Trump effect on the other, the calls for nationalistic solutions. But we Europeans really believe in united solutions, cooperative solutions, and European unity and solidarity are more important than ever. That is why this should be translated into an ambitious road map to be adopted in Rome on 25 March 2017, because we need once and for all to assert the European Union as a strong, economic, social, political and democratic power. We need to use the roadmap for this and to reconnect with our citizens with this purpose.  We believe in our Group that the road map should be an ambitious one, a progressive one. It means that if we start with the Bratislava road map, which pointed out the need for strengthening European defence and security, we can agree with it but also say clearly that it is not enough. We need to have a road map where social Europe is really at the heart to reconnect with citizens, making the best of the upcoming European pillar of social rights, and we need also to make sure that the growth and jobs strategy will be underpinned by a more powerful investment plan, aligned with sustainable development goals, and these goals should also inspire our development policy because this is the only way to go to the source of the oncoming migration wave. We need to cooperate with third countries, developing countries, to help them to address their development problems. This is the real root of the challenge coming from migration. And then of course, as you just mentioned, Prime Minister, another big test for your Presidency is to come up with a real European asylum system where we can again restate our values, because we cannot go on like that. What is happening with refugees so far is shameful. And finally, we need to translate this into credible financial instruments, financial means, which means to align the Community budget to support all these goals, and to make sure that eurozone Member States also have the instruments to implement these objectives. So we are waiting for the Commission White Paper. We would like also to have a powerful and balanced reform of the Economic and Monetary Union, and we count on your Presidency to support this push.

Let us hope that these presidencies will be the new start that the EU so badly needs: to face up to the challenges not just of the next six months, but of the next few years.  Presidencies so often judge their success on how many trilogues are completed, or how much new legislation is passed in their six months. But while more trilogue agreements can give the illusion of action, we have to ask with each new agreement whether the people we represent feel safer; whether the people we represent feel more prosperous; whether the people we represent feel more confident in us taking decisions on their behalf.  This must be a proud and historic moment in the history of Malta: a Maltese Prime Minister, a former Member of European Parliament, taking over the Presidency of the European Union, and you chose as your first priority to bring the EU closer to the people by encouraging vigorous debate on the key issues. But that closeness you desire will not be achieved by legislating every aspect of people’s lives or by being preoccupied with the intrigue and the politicking of the Brussels bubble, but by listening and acting on the big issues facing the EU and by doing less and doing it better – taking tough but fair decisions on migration and asylum, cooperating on security, offering protection against those who wish us harm, and solving the problems of the eurozone while facing the challenges and opportunities of Brexit. For while the process of Britain leaving the EU will begin on your watch, let us hope that this Presidency sees Brexit about more than just the intricacies of Article 50, but about creating the basis for a constructive and mutually beneficial relationship between the UK and the EU, a prosperous European Union trading and cooperating with a prosperous United Kingdom.  Let us hope that in addressing your specific issues of migration, security, the single market, social inclusion, the neighbourhood policy and the maritime sector, that the Maltese Presidency is able to draw a clear distinction between migration and asylum to ensure that the EU delivers a policy that is tough but fair, is able to strengthen security cooperation that makes our peoples feel protected and less vulnerable, to develop a single market that delivers less bureaucracy and more choice for consumers, to encourage social inclusion that learns from the very best projects in our local communities in each of our countries, and to develop a neighbourhood policy that does not mean a costly EU army, but the ability to take tough decisions on sanctions when they really matter, and also to encourage innovation and growth in the maritime sector to support increased open trade. So, speaking as leader of what is still the third largest political group in the European Parliament, I urge you to throw away the template of previous presidencies and take the EU in a new direction.

I thank you also for always defending the interests of the European Parliament, and that will be necessary in the coming months, in particular because of the negotiations on Brexit (although I will not talk about Brexit as we have a debate this afternoon with President Tusk). And I agree with my colleague, Mr Kamall – which is not always the case – when we say it could be a true turning point. Let’s face it, the turning point is already here: a US President, Trump, who is openly against the European Union and saying that other countries will break away. What other turning point do we need? Why are you still here, I ask myself? Go to the United States, go to the inauguration of Mr Trump instead of being here, but a US President openly saying that other countries are going to break away from the European Union? I have never seen it, never heard it before, and I think that it is a wake-up call for us to reform the European Union as fast as possible. If we don’t understand now that we have to stick together, that we need unity, that we need reform, that we need a more integrated European Union – also for our geopolitical interests – then when are we going to understand it?

You have an important summit in Valletta in February, where you are going to talk with the other leaders of the European Union about the future.

The Monti report was a report on the own resources of the European Union where the three institutions work together – the Council, Commission and European Parliament – that is the proposal we are making.

Ladies and gentlemen, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, the Presidency of Malta will be called upon to manage the deep economic crisis plaguing the peoples. To succeed, however, the obsession with pursuing disastrous neoliberal policies, supporting the Stability Pact and deepening economic and fiscal Union must stop. Instead, measures must be promoted that will boost the real economy and strengthen social cohesion. We welcome the goals set for job creation, sustainable development and support for small and medium-sized enterprises. However, the goals set still do not produce tangible results, as they are promoted in the context of neoliberal policies of harsh austerity that perpetuate the crisis and recession, inflate public debt, increase unemployment by widening inequalities, and lead peoples into poverty. . The Maltese Presidency has made refugee a top priority. A positive step is the goal of establishing a common asylum system and revising the Dublin Regulation and a fair burden-sharing. But these are not enough. Dublin must be completely abolished and a refugee policy based on humanity and solidarity must be developed. To put an end to any attempt to create a \"Europe-fortress\" in the model of the unacceptable agreement reached by the Union with Turkey. Legal and safe routes must be created as well as a permanent and fair system of refugee relocation. Otherwise, the appeals will continue to drown in the Mediterranean and the The European Union will be responsible. Equally important, in the context of the neighborhood policy, which is a priority, is to stop all support and participation in foreign interventions and to develop initiatives to make the Union a pillar of peace. In particular, to put pressure on Israel to end colonization, lift the occupation, and commit Israel to a roadmap for peace and the creation of two states. Finally, we expect the Maltese Presidency, in view of the developments in the Cyprus issue, to take initiatives so that the Union pressures Turkey to respect the human rights of all Cypriots, to lift the occupation, to withdraw the occupying troops from Cyprus, and to show a constructive attitude for a solution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of the bi-zonal bi-communal federation for a Cyprus without an army guarantee and divisive barbed wire.

Lithuania proved in 2013 that a first presidency of a small country can be successful. I'm sure you can do the same. But to say that the hour is serious. Between the Russian, Turkish, Chinese and now American presidents determined to divide Europe and an extreme right determined to dynamite it from within, the European Union, the world's first experience of transnational democracy, is threatened. I want to address here two issues of your presidency. You have placed migration as one of your top priorities and that is only natural. The year 2016 was the deadliest in the Mediterranean, the causes of migration are far from having disappeared and, at this very moment, tens of thousands of refugees arrived in the Union are still herded in totally inhuman conditions which threaten their life. Along with Italy and Greece, Malta is on the front line in facing this challenge and it cannot be said that the solidarity of the other Member States of the Union has been particularly rapid or particularly generous. I would therefore have expected Malta to deploy all its energy to mobilize this solidarity. Thus, the agreement of July 2015 providing for the relocation of 160,000 refugees remains weakly implemented: only 10,000 refugees have been relocated at this stage. Therefore, there is a need to expedite the execution of the agreement and ensure that distribution becomes the norm. It is unacceptable that frontline countries like Malta have to face it alone. But, that’s not what I’m reading in your program. On the contrary, it is in keeping with the spirit of the EU-Turkey \"contain and push back\" agreement. Worse still, you raise the possibility of concluding a similar agreement with Libya. So tell me: between two governments, two parliaments, countless warlords, who are you going to make a deal with? In order to get what? The confinement, in the hands of mafia groups, of migrants delivered to slavery and prostitution? It would be unworthy of the values ​​of the European Union. The second issue I want to bring up is tax justice, which is not even on your list of priorities. Unbridled tax competition between Member States only benefits large taxpayers. We must put an end to it and make tax justice a top priority. Otherwise, the explosion of inequalities, fueled by fiscal injustice, will allow the ranks of national populist parties to grow further. After the many scandals and revelations, the European Commission, supported by Parliament, has multiplied legislative initiatives of which I can not find any trace in your program. And we understand it. According to a study that we Greens have carried out, Malta is a real tax haven for foreign multinationals and wealthy individuals. Between 2012 and 2015, your country subtracted 14 billion euros in tax revenue from other EU Member States.

As we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, Brexit negotiations will officially begin. We will have to be firm because Europe à la carte is not a lasting solution. The British, led by an unprepared government, are already realizing the grim prospects for the country's exit from the Union.

As Britain sets off on an exciting Brexit future with Donald Trump in the White House and my colleagues here riding high in the polls, I’m actually quite optimistic – one of the very few who are optimistic about 2017. They may not get round to your tax status, as they’re too busy destroying our countries’ identities with mass migration, putting our security at risk, and their obsession with the Green Blob and gender issues.

We all know that only a healthy economy can address each of these issues that I have just mentioned, and that they are priorities of the Maltese Presidency, in an effective way.

And in this context, there is something that is in the hands of this Presidency, and that is to bring to a successful conclusion, for example, the dossiers, the legislation that has to do with the development of the single digital market. Why? Because the single digital market - digital transformation - is the great accelerator for the European economy to have that ability to compete globally and, therefore, that good health and can thus guarantee the proper development of all those priorities, to begin with, of the social dimension.

Apart from the many important issues that we have already discussed this morning, there is a great opportunity under the Maltese Presidency to make progress on international trade issues. I welcome the fact that the Council has reached agreement on trade defence instruments (TDI), but it has to be noted that this is quite far from Parliament’s 2014 position. I hope his government will show flexibility in trying to find a compromise between the institutions. Secondly, there is a proposal addressing China’s market economy status (MES), and for us this is a crucial file. Together with TDI reform, they are vital in defending European jobs, not just in the steel industry, but more widely. So I hope that, on both TDI and China’s MES, we can work closely and make significant progress. Also during your Presidency, in the trade area we expect the European Court of Justice to release the EU—Singapore free trade agreement (FTA) ruling. If the opinion of the Advocate General is confirmed, this will mean that it is a mixed agreement. That means that our trade credibility with our negotiating partners could be threatened, and I hope that at that point you would call for a discussion between Parliament, Commission and Council to find a way forward on this issue.

In this regard, on the World Day of Migrants and Refugees, the accent was placed on the high number of unaccompanied minors who, as we well know, are in greater need of attention and protection. The Union therefore needs to assume responsibility for migration and truly useful and functional legislative instruments are needed for an effective solution to the migration crisis.

Prime Minister, deputy Prime Minister, Ambassador, I shall be very short. It is clear that your Presidency has strong support from Members of Parliament. Also, as our President Juncker said, you have a strong ally in the European Commission.  We do appreciate, as President Juncker said, your strong emphasis on the social agenda, especially when you want to review our previous proposals on various fields, such as the participation of women in the labour market, prioritise the pillar on social rights, the posting of workers, the coordination of social security systems, and also when you have decided to have a ministerial meeting on the subject of sexual minorities. So it is very important for the EU as a whole, and it is very important for our citizens, to see that the Presidency is giving such high priority to the social agenda.  Another issue I would like to raise – and which was referred to here by many Members – is the security agenda: security and migration issues. But I also want to thank you for our last visit to Malta, to Valletta, when we had a chance to discuss the defence agenda. I know that Malta may have some constitutional issues with the defence policy as such, but I had a chance to discuss with the Finance Minister and the Minister on the Economy about defence investments, and that is something that everybody can share. There is a strong need for stronger European defence policies, but also a strong need for defence cooperation in defence investments in order to save money at the same time as making our continent more responsive, more secure, stronger and capable of addressing the challenges or threats coming from outside Europe. I also want to thank you for prioritising internal market issues, single market—related issues, because those are European-level structural reforms which will reshape Europe, and which will strengthen our capability to modernise our economy. The internal market is a way to create new jobs, but it also creates more competition and gives more opportunities to consumers and to our companies, so that is why we appreciate your strong support for the work of the Commission in this field.  I just want to mention that we have just disclosed our services and internal market package, and that is one part of the entire internal market agenda. You have also emphasised your willingness to work with the European Parliament on the EFSI 2 proposal. Let’s hope that Parliament can finalise the internal processes as soon as possible, and then the trilogues can start during your Presidency, and it would even be possible to have a final conclusion approval of the legislation later on in your Presidency.  Finally, I want to thank you for your support on CETA agreement trade policy even though there is growing opposition to trade, but it is the way to govern globalisation. Free trade doesn’t mean trade without rules. Actually, free trade means trade with rules, which enables trading partners to have an easier trading environment, and this is the way we can govern globalisation and make it more socially and environmentally responsible.

I will try to touch on most, if not all, of the issues that have been raised by my friends. First of all, I would like to thank the leaders of the different groups for their extremely positive welcome and the extremely positive words they had for this Presidency.  I will start with migration once again. I know this is an extremely thorny issue – not only at European level, but in each and every one of our Member States. It is an extremely emotional issue, and perhaps stirs up all the wrong sentiments. This is where the battlegrounds for the next elections in our Member States and elsewhere will be played for at least the next generation. So whatever we do today has a short-term impact on the composition of the different institutions and the different governments in our Member States, and it cannot be underestimated. But if we wait for a total solution – for a perfect solution with no shortcomings to be found – we are condemned to go round in circles and stay in the same rut. My point today was – and still is – that we may have ideological differences – actually, we might have moral differences – on the way we approach this issue. Some of us may see it as more of a humanitarian crisis, while others see it as a security issue. Maybe we are both right. My point goes beyond that. That is the ideological discourse. That is the long-term. In the long term, we are all dead. In the short term, in three months’ time, we will have another crisis.  I am the first to hope that I am completely wrong on this. I am the first to hope that, come next spring, it will be business as usual with maybe a few crossings that one, two, three or a maximum of four Member States can take in. But I’m afraid that I will not be wrong, and the situation is that we either take a decision now or we will have to take a much bolder decision when there is a crisis, and when there are hundreds of thousands of people putting pressure on governments, communities and our families, and when we will need to take decisions that may not be well thought out. This is really the last train we can catch to do something which is structured when it comes to the collective handling of the migration crisis. Money alone will not do it. So simply thinking that migration, the impending crisis and the fact that even if we do something now it is not a long—term solution, and thinking that this can be solved by throwing more money at the problem, is delusional. That is not what this is about. This is about border control. This is about having a new system to share the burden. This is about creating humanitarian corridors where and when necessary. This is about acknowledging the fact that, if we even throw around the concept of building walls that has been used by some Member States – which I personally disagree with, but I will not judge that Member State for doing that – as a country with a maritime border, we cannot build a wall in the sea. I am sorry to break it to you, but when my navy people call me at night, they do not ask me whether they can turn the people back or not. They just tell me that we need to save the people from drowning. If we allow this to happen again – not hitting these criminal gangs where it hurts, not engaging with the countries on the southern littoral of the Mediterranean – we are in for more trouble.  We are inviting more trouble by trying to postpone the issue until there is a perfect solution. There will be no perfect solution for Dublin. There will be no perfect solution for border control. There can only be progress if we really accept one another’s views. I need to accept people’s views where I might have some ideological differences, but at this point in time we need operational solutions that have been missing so far. Our aim, as the Maltese Presidency, is to try to achieve progress. I think that we were mostly on the same page on Brexit. On taxation, I would tell my colleagues that I totally refute the label of ‘tax haven’ or ‘offshore’ for my country. Our country’s tax system was approved by the European Commission after being thoroughly examined before membership more than a decade ago, so I do not see why things that were approved pre—membership are now a problem. I have every respect for my colleague, Mr Casa. I understand his speech. This concerns local politics, and I do not think that we should deal with it here, but we will have all the time in the world to have a healthy political fight back home. Back here, I want to stress one final point on the issue of the social agenda, the social pillar of the Commission, and the issue of free trade. I do not see these as contradictory aims. I actually see these as complementary aims. It is through free trade that we can create more growth and more jobs. Usually, I have felt a bit out of tune with my social democratic family in being a very clear advocate of free trade, but seeing that even the President of China is an advocate of free trade, I feel a little bit more at ease in saying that free trade is good if it is properly regulated. I think that the main issue on which we should focus right now is not trying to be protectionist. Social Europe does not mean protectionist Europe. It does not mean withdrawing from the world. It does not mean trying to put up barriers to what we have achieved so far. Social Europe means that the growth and the well-being that we create through free trade needs to be distributed in an equal – or at least a fair – manner. This was missing for many years in our Member States. All the well-being that was created through the policies that were advocated, even by this institutions, did not percolate through the system, and we have to admit that the belief in only a trickle—down economic approach did not work. So, will we find a solution to all this in the next six months? Obviously not. What we want to do is to set the ball rolling in the right direction and build on the good work that has been done by our predecessors. One final point to Parliament, rest assured that the political presence of Council within Parliament will be assured as much as possible, because we want a genuine dialogue with you.

In particular, I appreciate the emphasis placed on the need for a program to address the present migration crisis. Like Italy and Greece, Malta too has suffered at the forefront of the impact of the migration crisis and, for this reason, is directly aware of the challenges and the need for solidarity between the Member States, an essential European value. I therefore hope that the Maltese Presidency will be committed as a matter of priority to the revision of the Dublin III regulation and to an effective and fair sharing of the burdens linked to the migratory flows that currently weigh almost exclusively on the States of first landing.

No one can have any doubts that it will be an extraordinary year for Europe and the European Union. Last year, we managed to make progress on migration, security and the economy, in spite of the unprecedented difficulties we faced. This was thanks, in great part, to your hard work and sense of responsibility in responding to events. Similarly, I trust that we will rise together to meet the challenges of the next months. I would now like to briefly outline the main results of the December European Council. Leaders discussed our efforts to regain control over migration. The radical drop in irregular migration on the Eastern Mediterranean route was possible thanks to our decision to get back to Schengen, the closure of the Western Balkan route and Turkey’s cooperation. In this context, leaders stressed their commitment to implementing the EU-Turkey Statement, which also requires efforts from the Turkish side. As regards the Central Mediterranean route, High Representative Mogherini reported on the progress with African countries. Last year, 180 000 migrants arrived irregularly in Italy. This is a situation that cannot continue. That is why Libya and our approach to the Central Mediterranean route will be the key point of the next informal summit in Malta. As you know, the EU supports the Government of National Accord and its efforts to consolidate peace and stability in Libya. We stand ready to step up the EU’s engagement to strengthen the capacity to address security issues and consolidate institutions, in full respect of Libyan sovereignty. As for Ukraine, we adopted a legally-binding decision of the leaders to facilitate the ratification of the Association Agreement in the Netherlands. This decision addresses the concerns expressed by the Dutch voters last year. Now, the responsibility lies in the Netherlands. The ratification is important not only for Ukraine, but also for Europe’s geo-political standing and credibility. We did what we could to help save the Association Agreement already ratified by 27 Member States and the European Parliament. Now the ball is in the court of the Dutch. On the Minsk agreements, Chancellor Merkel and President Hollande gave their assessment of the Normandy process for resolving the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Their clear recommendation was that since Russia has still not implemented the Minsk agreement, sanctions should be prolonged. They are now in place for a further six months. The world has become a more dangerous place, whether we talk about open conflict, terrorism or so-called hybrid war in the form of cyberattacks and public disinformation. Therefore, the leaders agreed to step up work on defence, in partnership with NATO. They have also agreed to increase cooperation on external security across the board – from research to how we develop military capabilities, right down to how we conduct our missions and operations. More resources will be needed, most importantly at the national level on defence spending, but also through funds from the European Union. Your support for this work will be critical, given the institutional and financial questions involved. The objective is clear: European countries should do more in the face of the immediate security threats facing our citizens, and so should the European Union. The leaders also discussed internal security. The political agreement on the EU’s Counter-Terrorism Directive, which criminalises foreign fighters and their activities throughout the European Union, is the right step forward, but we need more. Leaders called for the remaining decisions which can prevent future terror attacks to be swiftly finalised and implemented, such as, for example, tougher legislation on firearms.  We have called on the co-legislators to agree by June on an Entry-Exit System, and by the end of 2017, on a European Travel Information and Authorisation System. This will ensure that visa-exempt travellers are screened systematically. These are tough deadlines, but the situation requires that we work more quickly than normally. The leaders also discussed several initiatives aimed at making the European economy work for everyone. We had an exchange with President Draghi, who underlined that the improved economic situation still needs reform efforts. The statistics are better, but the important thing is for ordinary people and businesses to feel confident about the future. This is why the European Fund for Strategic Investment will be extended, our trade defence instruments will be modernised, and the Youth Guarantee will be continued. To strengthen our recovery, 2017 needs to be a year of great ambition for the single market, both in terms of deepening and modernisation. Parliament’s role is obviously vital here. Finally, on Brexit, the EU 27 had a short informal meeting where we agreed procedural arrangements and reconfirmed our principles, namely the indivisibility of the four freedoms, the balance of rights and obligations and our rule of ‘no negotiations without notification’. The European Council will maintain political control over the process, while ensuring that the Commission is the Union’s chief negotiator. The leaders fully realise the important role of the European Parliament in the process. With this in mind, they invited the chief negotiator to keep Parliament closely and regularly informed, and agreed how the European Council would interact with Parliament throughout the coming months. With this work now done, the EU stands ready to start the negotiations when the UK notifies its departure. Lastly, let me make one comment. Yesterday’s speech by Prime Minister May proves that the unified position of 27 Member States on the indivisibility of the single market was finally understood and accepted by London. It would be good if our partners also understood that there will be no place for pick-and-choose tactics in our future negotiations. At the same time, I want to underline that we took note of the warm and balanced words of Prime Minister May on European integration, which were much closer to the narrative of Winston Churchill than that of the American President-Elect Trump.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 81, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Jyrki Katainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, this agenda allows us to look at the future at least 12 months ahead and assess what the political priorities are and how our political environment will evolve during this year. I think we need at least three things. First, unity. Second, we have to defend our institutions and their role, and third, we have to concentrate on deliverables and delivering those of our initiatives which have already been decided.  When looking at unity, the last European Council meeting was very good in that sense. It showed and expressed a strong unity and strong willingness to cooperate with other institutions. When looking at the role of the institutions, it is more important than ever before. We have been challenged from outside, but also from within. Many of those who have challenged the idea of an integrated Europe want, at the same time, to destroy our institutions and integration as a whole. So, in the so-called post—truth era, the institutions play a role because they represent the same basis for dealing with those issues. The institutions want to make sure that we have the same facts, those which we share and those from which we can draw different conclusions in an organised manner. That is also why the art of making compromises is getting very, very important. You cannot make compromises if your institutions are not strong and if they are not defended. So that is why all the European institutions deserve to be defended and strengthened, and there of course this House plays a crucial role.  A couple of words on delivery. Delivery was one of the main issues in the European Council. It was reinforced in December with a joint declaration of the EU’s legislative priorities for 2017, signed for the first time by all three institutions, and that sort of unity was also shown during the informal meeting of 27 Heads of State or Government after December’s European Council. When it comes to the discussion with the UK following an Article 50 notification, all of Europe’s institutions and all 27 Member States will be singing from the same hymn sheet. The Commission was absolutely clear that this House should play a full role in those proceedings, and our chief negotiator, Mr Barnier, will work closely with Parliament’s representatives to make sure that this will also happen.  From the substance point of view, the defence issue is one of the main points on the agenda in the European Council. Just to mention a few main areas in defence. First, we have to make sure that our public procurement system is becoming stronger. It is quite amazing that only 20% of purchases in the defence field have been tendered internationally. Eighty per cent of purchases happen domestically, and that is one of the reasons why our defence industry has not developed as well as other areas of industry. It is also one of the reasons why defence equipment is getting more and more expensive – faster than the others. That is why we need a better internal market in defence. Second, we need your support when looking at next year’s budget when our intention is to increase research money in the defence sector. The capability window also needs large cooperation. The Commission is working very hard on this, and we are trying to find suitable well—functioning ways for Member States to make joint purchases and, by doing so, save money and strengthen our defence in the long run. On migration, we also saw renewed willingness to cooperate on migration and security, areas in which we have seen significant results in the last 12 months. We have already seen the first results, notably in our partnership with Niger, which has already taken action to combat migrant smuggling and has received EU support to implement its macro-economic reform programme. But we need to see more of this, and this is why we now need the co-legislators to swiftly agree on the Commission’s proposal to stimulate investment in tackling irregular migration at the grassroots level. The new European Fund for Sustainable Development will have the potential to mobilise up to EUR 44 billion to create jobs, improve social conditions and promote sustainable development where it is most needed.  Finally, some words on the social dimension and economic growth. We were very happy with the strong support from the Council towards our social agenda. We have to pay attention to our societies and people’s resilience, especially at a time when industrial revolution will recede our market. We have to make sure that Europeans and our societies are more resilient, and education plays a role there. But other ways to invest in youth are also very important. That is why we were very pleased that the Council backed our Youth Employment initiative by accepting a EUR 2 billion increase in funding for this purpose. The European Solidarity Corps also got strong backing from the Council.  Finally, we also got very strong support from the Council for the EFSI 2.0 project. We encourage the European Parliament to take its position as soon as possible so that we can conclude this proposal by the end of the Maltese Presidency, and we also need your support in internal market projects which got very strong backing from the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 82, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, dear Donald Tusk, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen! A warm welcome and a hopefully happy new year for 2017, that it will be better than 2016. I would like to focus on two topics today, looking back on the Council too. The first is of course Brexit. We are all grateful for yesterday's speech, that we have received further explanations, that we have made some further progress. But the speech still did not produce such correct clarity. For example, I hear this statement about punishment. I think we can all agree today: there will be no punishment for Great Britain. Nobody wants to punish Britain for the decision that has been made. You want to leave the European Union. Today the European Union is above all an internal market, the European Union is a large internal market. You want to leave the internal market, but afterwards you want to conclude a free trade agreement in order to regain full access to the internal market. That's the idea I heard yesterday. So I ask myself: what do you want to leave? Do you want to leave the EU now or do you not want to leave the EU? If that wasn't the name of the European Union, then maybe some over in London would apply for membership. But just because it is called EU, unfortunately many of God are of the opinion that this is the devil. Dear colleagues, “Out means out, Brexit means Brexit”, I hear all the time. And that's why we will be discussing this very intensively at specific points in the coming weeks and months. For example, my group will not allow the financial market for the euro, our common currency, to continue to be managed or helped to shape from London if London is no longer part of the European Union in the future. I may make a second point still say: On the one hand, we mustn't talk about punishing someone. On the other hand, Britain can obviously threaten us. Hammond and Theresa May now propose the thesis that it is being said that a new economic model is being sought for Great Britain, a tax dumping model is being used in order to make it more interesting for companies to invest in Great Britain. It's going through my head whether Great Britain also wants to leave the G8, because there were agreements against tax dumping. And I also ask myself who is supposed to pay the tax losses caused by tax dumping in Great Britain. The little people will foot the bill and the big corporations will be tax-free. That will be the result of applying this new tax model. I would promote it: we don't punish and London doesn't threaten. Then we would create a lot of good atmosphere in the talks. Dear Colleagues! A second issue that I want to address is developments in the United States of America that will affect us in Europe. We respect the election results, we face a new administration openly, as every democrat does, and there are no prejudices either. However, there are now first statements from the newly elected president. As an economic area, the European Union is the same size as the United States of America. And that is why you have to make it clear to all those who are now threatening Europeans, including European corporations, that we too have power with the internal market, with the law on state aid. For example, I am already asking myself how many jobs Google actually has in Europe. Or I ask myself how much taxes Apple actually pays in Europe. We too can ask questions when Americans ask questions. We will use our power to do so. Incidentally, I would also see the developments among the Americans as an opportunity for us, because the Canadians, the Mexicans, the Japanese are all somewhat worried about the developments in America. Actually, the European Council should now start with a diplomatic initiative to win all partners around America as partners for Europe, because that would be a good community. I would like to conclude with what Guy Verhofstadt had already mentioned earlier this morning: What are we actually doing as Europeans when Trump really questions NATO? What are we actually doing as Europeans when Trump withdraws the troops from Poland? What do we as Europeans actually do when a deal is made with Russia at the expense of Ukraine and Ukraine's right to self-determination is suddenly called into question? What do we do then? President-in-Office of the Council, shall we be concerned, shall we then sit down, do we have special meetings again, as we often do, or do we have the strength to prepare for it now? Is Europe finally growing up? Is Europe finally taking the necessary steps to deepen and strengthen this European Union in order to finally become self-confident? The nationalists are the gravedigger of the nation-states. Only a united Europe can mean that the nation states still have power and influence in a globalized world. And when in America they say “America first”, then we can say “Europe first”.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 83, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "Before I give the floor to Mr Niedermüller on behalf of the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, I want to say that, given the delay and given that we have to vote at 16.30, I cannot grant the \"blue card\" and therefore I will not grant it tonobody.Let's see if we can do the catch-the-eye.The floor to Mr Niedermüller.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 84, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Péter NIEDERMÜLLER", "mepid": "124723", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, migration remains one of Europe's most important problems in the European Union. That is why I am very pleased to note that the Council attaches great importance to the establishment of the European Asylum Agency and the provision of the necessary financial resources. I am convinced that, in addition to the border agency, the other cornerstone of the common European asylum system must be the asylum agency.

That is the least we can say, because I remember that the last strategic paper of Javier Solana of 2003 spoke about the ‘ring of friends’ around us. I think it is more the ‘ring of fire’ around us. Putin, the conflicts in the Middle East, but merely also the new US President-Elect, Mr Trump. I have to tell you, I am a little bit disappointed at the reaction of the European Union against a US leader who is saying that it’s the end of the European Union – that there will be other Member States leaving the European Union. It’s insane! I think that we have to react to this. What would happen in the US if European leaders were saying, ‘we think that California will break away’, or ‘Florida will break away’? Immediately, I think that the Ambassador of the European Union would be called to the State department in Washington to explain what this means. We have to be very conscious of the fact that this will be a turning point on 20 January 2017. Whether you like it or not, it will be a turning point – maybe not completely, but certainly in the way that we have to look at our relationship with the US, and more precisely inside the European Union. It is now the time not only to fix the European Union, but to do a number of things that were impossible in the past. Five years ago, you were saying that the European Defence Union was not necessary. In reality, it is definitely necessary, and we have to speed it up. It is the same thing with the European Border and Coast Guard. The migration crisis can only be tackled with the European Border and Coast Guard. Not with one with EUR 250 million – that is what we spent today on the European Border and Coast Guard – in the US, the amount spent on the border and coast guard is USD 32 billion. That’s the comparison we have to make. The same with the governance of the eurozone, where the Five Presidents’ Report – when is it coming? How long do we have to wait for a legislative proposal from the Commission to come to the Council and to the European Parliament? It is time to fix it, like it is time also to fix the cleaning up of our banks. It has taken eight years now, and we can tell that they have not cleaned up our banks in Europe; we still face the problems.  So, in the Brexit negotiations, I think you are completely right, and Mr Weber is completely right when he said no cherry picking at all. We shall never accept it. You can say, ‘I want to leave the Union, I want to leave the European Judicial Court, I want to leave the Customs Union’, but you cannot at the same time say ‘oh, but that little piece interests me, and that is something that I like ...’ No way! It is a fair agreement that we are looking for, not a situation where it is better to be outside the European Union than inside, as a Member State.

I would rather say the conclusions were meagre at best.  That might actually be OK if it were a smooth time, with nothing much happening just before Christmas and if there were nothing much to do, but I think we all share a common feeling that is not really the world that we are living in. We have Brexit, we have Trump, we have refugees freezing to death in Europe, we have the rights of the far right, we have conflicts in our neighbourhoods – there are so many issues that we need to address, so many solutions that we need to find, and not just hang out and talk nicely. So, where is the plan for a social Europe? Where are the bold moves to establish tax justice in Europe? Where is the action on investment rather than austerity? Where is the joint effort to help refugees, to establish some sort of dignity at least for people looking for protection, and also for Europe? Where is the common answer for Trump? Where is the common voice in foreign policy, and where are the Member States when it comes to implementing things? As for the Defence Union and new papers, all that is very nice, but where would be the implementation of the pooling and sharing that Member States had already decided a long time ago? On all of the burning issues we get ‘nada’and ‘niente’ (and you see I am practising my Italian). We got nothing from the Council.  We got some nice warm words – or some cold words, when it came to migration – but that’s it. We don’t need to have European Council meetings just to keep us busy, as I think we are all rather busy!  We need a European Council that works on the future of Europe with bold decisions and real tangible results, because a lot is at stake. The whole project, the whole dream, the whole idea of Europe is at stake and is under threat. We do not have much time, and we will not get many opportunities to do something about that – to rescue this idea, and not just to rescue it, but also to further develop it. I don’t expect the Council to save us all, but I do expect the Council to make a meaningful contribution, and I do expect the Presidency and the President of the Council to put serious proposals on the table to work for the best of Europe, and not just for a nice group picture. We, as Parliament, cannot wait for the Council to do something and get serious. After we have been so busy with ourselves for the last two days, which was nice, fun and all exciting, I think it is high time that we get back to business, back to policies, back to improving the lives of everyone living in Europe, and it is really urgent that we do that because we only have one Europe and it needs us.

I think it’s interesting that the conclusions of the Council meeting raised the issues of migration and security, because these two issues go hand—in—hand, as has recently been shown by the attacks on our continent. Certain politicians, whom I don’t have to name here in this speech, should hang their heads in shame because of their dangerous and reckless policies which have allowed jihadis to cross our borders freely without checks. Thank goodness that we, the UK, will be leaving.  Yesterday, our Prime Minister, Theresa May, set out her negotiation positions. While I applaud some of it, other parts I find concerning. Firstly, I am worried that the so-called interim arrangements and phased implementation is simply Whitehall speak for a slow—motion Brexit. I am also concerned that there was no mention of immediate immigration controls, which means that, by the time we are fully out of the EU, on current trends, we could have another million people come into our country from the continent. And no one in Britain, bar UKIP, is holding the government to account on these issues, mainly because the British Labour Party is a shambles that has let down working class people for far too long. I am, however, glad that the Prime Minister made it clear that we are leaving the single market. This would allow us – if the government has the willpower – to control our own borders, not pay a membership fee, and not have to comply with EU regulations and directives. So I say to the EU negotiators: now is not the time for empty threats. Britain is not bluffing. Britain will not be bullied. Britain is not some sort of small nation on the periphery of Europe. We are the United Kingdom, the fifth largest economy in the world. We have links all over the globe to the Anglosphere, the Commonwealth, the emerging markets of the Far East. It is clear that Britain is going global as a result of that momentous vote on 23 June 2016. I believe we have a great future ahead of us.

Once again, therefore, the Member States, which have received and welcomed huge numbers of migrants, are pushing those countries that have had enough sense to now take these migrants kindly. Of course, there will be no redistribution even now, but such unresolved challenges prevent a real solution, and that is refugee camps in North Africa. If these exist, for example, the Italian Coast Guard can immediately transport all \"as\" rescued migrants to such a camp, where they can apply for asylum. I am talking about 'as if' the rescued, because it is, in fact, a gross abuse of the European coastguards.

But the Council must be consistent: either we are left with a preparatory research action and its 90 million euros, or we are seriously talking about a Europe of defense, and we stop making people believe that budgetary redeployments will be enough. Because, for this priority, as for many others, the budgetary question can no longer be avoided. On youth unemployment, if we stick to the rhetoric, one might think there is magnificent unanimity. But when it comes to going to the cash ... So, of course, during our last budget negotiation, Parliament obtained 500 million euros but, at the same time, the Council was trying to impose that this be the balance of any account until the end of the financial framework. Priorities are piling up, but budget shortfalls are overwhelming. The Council is increasing its commitments while tightening the purse strings.

Many Members have painted our future in quite dark colours. Many Members have also referred to what President Donald Trump or others have said. Our thinking is that we should not let others define what Europe is about. Let us not let others define or say where we are going. It is our own responsibility to take this Union and this continent in the direction we want to develop in.  A very positive statement came from Germany this week: Chancellor Merkel said that Europe’s fate is in our own hands. This is something we all must remember at the moment. Let us not pay too much attention to what others are saying about us. Let us shape our own future. In times like this, someone should represent the voice of common sense and responsibility. That is why our institutions play a crucial role. It might be politically interesting to comment on other people’s speeches or statements, but we have to concentrate on delivering on the issues which will reshape our continent and our Union. Even Prime Minster May has said that she does not hope that other countries will follow the UK’s example because, according to her, a strong EU is important to the UK. If you have a look at the latest Eurobarometers, our citizens are showing very strong leadership at the moment. Many people think that the EU should have a bigger role in counter—terrorism and that the EU should pay more attention to defence and to social justice and equality. Many of our citizens think that the EU should play a bigger role in energy policy and, of course, in the fight against climate change and on migration issues. If we look at our ambitious agenda today – for instance, our latest proposal on services, the digital internal market, the energy package, low-carbon mobility, the circular economy, border control and defence – it is fair to say that Europe will be more closely integrated in five years’ time than it is at the moment. And this is only because of a pragmatic approach: we have to do things which will reshape Europe to be more prosperous and secure. Finally, regarding a few issues on EFSI, some mistakes were presented in today’s debate. Somebody said that EFSI has not achieved the goals which were set for it. On the contrary, so far, EFSI has financed operations in 28 Member States, with around EUR 30 billion. This will mobilise around EUR 164 billion in additional real investments on the ground.

This is a good step that should be supported. - In the context of security, it is necessary to revise, or even re-promote, the financing mechanism for the Athena mission, which has not been used in a satisfactory manner so far. I will observe with interest the development of the ideas contained in the European defense action plan proposed by the Commission and supported by the Council. The idea of ​​the European Defense Fund deserves particular attention, especially in the episode of joint capacity building. It is crucial for the Union to actively join in strengthening the sense of and building security, especially in today's global political climate. - I would also like to draw your attention to the agreement on the extension of the operation of the ESI Funds, which is due to be approved in the first half of this year. It is important to work on increasing the promotion of the program in the Member States of Central and Eastern Europe so that they take full advantage of the investment opportunities they need.

I have received the following nominations: Mr Bearder, Mr Karski, Mr Kovatchev, Mr Maňka and Mr Morin-Chartier. The candidates have informed me that they accept their respective applications. Let's move on to the rules, please pay attention. I will speak slowly so the interpretation can also be clear. Since the number of candidates does not exceed the number of 5 seats to be filled, the candidates are elected by acclamation pursuant to Article 15 (1) of the Rules. However, I propose that we proceed to a vote to establish the order of precedence, so if you agree we will proceed with a vote. I proclaim that the Quaestors I have just mentioned have been elected, I congratulate them on their election, but I would now move on to defining the order of precedence of the Quaestors, since it is only a question of defining the order of precedence. A qualified majority is not required for this ballot. So if you agree, I proclaim elected the Quaestors and now I would proceed to fix the order of precedence, as happens for the Vice-Presidents, with a secret electronic vote. To allow MEPs to become familiar with the electronic system, let's do a test. I remind you that pursuant to article 15, paragraph 1, of the regulation, in the event of a single ballot for the allocation of several seats, the ballot is valid only if more than half of the available votes have been cast, i.e. there are 5 candidates you must express at least 3 preferences. Instructions for using electronic voting have been distributed. After the opening of the ballot, the following information appears on the screen: the object of the ballot, the list of candidates, the number of seats to be filled. You have to go to the name of the chosen candidate by pressing the blue keys located on the right below the screen or the touch keys on the right of the screen and cast your vote by pressing the \"+\" key, which is the left key on the terminal. The blue light turns on and an asterisk appears in front of the name of the selected candidate. The vote counter indicates a decrease, only the most favorable votes are counted. To ensure the confidentiality of the vote, the asterisk disappears when you move the cursor. To abstain press the \"0\" key, which is the middle key. Before the announcement of the closing of the ballot, it is possible to change the choice made by repositioning the candidate's name and pressing the \"+\" key again to cancel the favorable vote. Then go to the name of another candidate and press the \"+\" key or press the \"0\" key to abstain. It is not possible to vote against a candidate. To view all the candidates for which the Member has voted, press the blue button located below the screen on the left. Pressing the key a second time cancels the display of the asterisks. I think it's clear. You are all quite experienced. Names will now appear that do not match the candidates. Let's try. Unfortunately, the name of Pavarotti who is deceased has been entered… Okay, let's try the vote. The ballot is open. Have you all voted? The vote is closed. You see the result, we make the result appear on the screen if possible. Let's show the number of votes obtained by the candidates. We now pass to the vote for the definition of the order of precedence. I remind you that you must express at least 3 preferential votes. If less than 3 names are selected, the vote is void.

You are well aware of the history of this file. In 2011 no agreement among the 28 Member States could be found so some Member States decided to pursue the route of enhanced cooperation in this area, which is an option foreseen by the EU Treaties. We welcome the fact that in 2012 Parliament issued its consent for this scenario and in 2013 Parliament issued its opinion on the respective Commission legislative proposal for enhanced cooperation regarding the FTT. Against this background, I would like to brief you on the remaining issues that need to be resolved in these negotiations, as we understand them from the perspective of the Presidency.  The political objectives and implications which could be expected from such a project were made clear by the Commission when the FTT proposal was put forward. You are well aware that the negotiations on an FTT are of a very complex nature and they have turned out to be quite time-consuming. Some have also made the more general point that, if the FTT is not implemented on a wide scale globally, the threat to national revenues, markets and the investment environment may outweigh any benefits. Nevertheless, some EU Member States already have their national laws on taxing financial transactions in place. These laws are adapted to national specificities and we have to clearly evaluate which aspects of such a national tax could be introduced at EU level.  As you are aware, the state of play on these negotiations has been discussed regularly and publicly in the Council, involving all 28 Ministers as required by the Treaties. The Presidency is ready to continue this practice even though Malta is not an FTT participating country. In the last Ecofin meeting during the Slovak Presidency in December, on the initiative of participating Member States, further progress was demonstrated on a number of elements of the FTT. Such progress was deemed to be of high importance for further work with a view to refining the remaining aspects of the future FTT and drafting the legislative text of the directive. Moreover, participating Member States presented their findings relating to the cost efficiency of FTT collection as the discussions so far have shown a need for further reassurance that the tax can be collected in a cost-efficient way.  Building on the progress made regarding the principle of territoriality, the tax base and the taxable event of a future FTT, a draft legislative text may possibly be drafted in the coming months. It seems clear to us that further work in the Council and its preparatory bodies will be required before a final agreement can be reached among participating Member States. As the Council Presidency, I would like to recall that any agreement will also have to respect the competencies, rights and obligations of Member States that do not participate in the enhanced cooperation.  In conclusion, I am confident of the view that, if negotiations proceed in a constructive manner, there will be a chance for a first step in the area of FTT at EU level. The Presidency will be supportive of that process and assist where it can.

Ladies and gentlemen, dear Members of Parliament, dear Council, it was the Commission which proposed to introduce a harmonised Financial Transaction Tax in 2011 and which proposed a Financial Transaction Tax under enhanced cooperation in 2013. The objectives of this latter proposal are: first, to strengthen the single market by reducing the number of divergent national approaches to Financial Transaction Taxation; second, to ensure that the financial sector makes a fair and substantial contribution to public revenues; and, finally, the Financial Transaction Tax will support regulatory measures in encouraging the financial sector to engage in more responsible activities geared towards the real economy. The Commission therefore fully supports the work of the Member States participating in the enhanced cooperation and acknowledges the significant basic agreement among the ten participating Member States on the core engine of the text. This agreement has now to be translated into a legal text.  There are still some features of the text design that have to be decided upon. The Commission stands ready to continue to provide technical support to participating Member States in their effort to present the final FTT design. The Commission encourages and supports the ten Member States participating in the enhanced cooperation to undertake all the necessary steps in order to define a calendar that will allow a compromise decision on the full text to be reached by mid-2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 151, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Dariusz ROSATI", "mepid": "28394", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, when the Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) was proposed by the Commission in 2011, it was greeted with euphoria by many. The tax was supposed to limit the scope for speculative transactions that were at the root of the financial crisis. Now, almost six years down the road, the FTT is still being debated and the initial enthusiasm has largely vanished. We know that there are two major problems with the FTT. First, when a tax is imposed on financial transactions it tends not only to reduce speculation, but also harms productive transactions such as equity investment and bond trading. The extent to which this negative effect contains productive capital flows may be substantial. And second, when a tax is imposed by a group of selected countries only, financial transactions tend to migrate to other jurisdictions where no taxes are applied. These capital outflows from countries concerned may jeopardise their growth prospects.  If, however, an FTT is to be eventually implemented, it should be carefully designed so as to minimise the risks involved. Three suggestions can be made in this context. First, the tax rate has to be set at a very low level to minimise efficiency losses and hit only high-frequency speculative transactions. Second, the tax base has to be as broad as possible, covering all financial transactions in order to avoid arbitration. And third, its purpose should be strictly to reduce speculation. It should not be burdened with other noble goals, such as providing additional budgetary revenues or the redistribution of wealth.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 152, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Udo BULLMANN", "mepid": "4267", "text": "on behalf of the S&D Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, good representative of the Council!

Well—judged regulation is important. Ill—judged regulation, as is the case with the EU’s proposed FTT, can do immense economic damage. Indeed the FTT would have a severe impact on the functioning of debt markets, which are essential for governments and companies to raise funds, as it would increase both their borrowing and operational costs. The Commission’s proposal is not just a tax on banks and is not just a tax on speculation, but will impact all areas of business as it will be applied at each stage of a multi-tiered financial transaction. This will have damaging consequences for the overall economy as it will cause a flood of financial activity to move beyond the borders of the FTT zone. As for the non—participating states, the FTT will be charged not just on transactions that take place within the 11 countries, but on any transaction that involves shares or bonds issued by them. It therefore threatens to give investors an extra reason not to buy Europe’s securities or transact with its institutions at a time when it can ill afford to drive away economic activity.

Spain is today one of the States engaged in an enhanced cooperation operation to establish a tax on financial transactions. We started this path here in 2011. In 2013, France and Italy already began to apply their own tax. On January 22, 2013 it was agreed that ten countries would do it together in 2014. And the last Ecofin of 2015 promised it for ten in mid-2016. I hope this time is the good one. I say this because today's debate reminds us that we need to return to a world in which the financial system returns to its instrumental function and is simply engaged in mediating between savings and productive activities. I say this because we need that money to drive innovation, growth; to consolidate the social pillar, to rescue people from marginalization. A didactic and useful way to achieve this is to move on this subject from words to actions. Just raising the debate is useful because it recognizes that these operations must be taxed. Implementing this rate should help prevent and avoid some simply speculative operations that do not generate employment and only enrich those who practice them; activities that do not boost the economy. This tax will not harm users of banking services; It is intended to tax the medium and large-scale purchase and sale of financial assets, a not exactly daily operation for the vast majority of Europeans.

New crises are therefore likely. The financial lobby argues against the tax: It would make the financing of investments and protection against exchange rate fluctuations more expensive. Both are obviously unjustified, because the tax does not affect stocks or government bonds themselves, but only excessive trading in them, such as the high-frequency trading of the Flash Boys, as described so brilliantly by US author Michael Lewis in a bestseller. Therefore, repos and government bonds must also be included. When buying a currency option, the EU proposal would incur a tax of only 0.01%.

We are a little concerned that this ambitious proposal, which we have been working on since 2011 and that Parliament has asked, will begin to dissolve like a small lump of sugar, in the sense that, well, we already have a strengthened cooperation with only ten countries, and we are also concerned that there are things that are gradually being diluted. In other words, we have an increasingly reduced tax base. We are concerned that they want to exclude, for example, derivatives of futures, derivatives of interest rates. Afterwards, they are also talking - we do not yet have the rates, but they are talking - of extremely low rates, with which, if that were the case, obviously, the two objectives that I believe that this tax has, which are, obviously, to collect (and the figure of 35 billion that has already been remembered would be very important) and also to stop some of the speculative activities, they would fall very short. From that point of view, I think that both the Council and the Commission should try to insist on two issues: first, that this finally comes through. We are also concerned about the calendar because we had negotiations on December 5 that were postponed, and we are already behind many delays in their implementation, but also that the Commission and the Council insist, even if it is in reinforced cooperation, that this tax really has capacity to exercise its function. That we do not have a formal financial transaction tax, but with very little specificity or so weak that it practically does not fulfill its function. With which, to that I do invite you, to tighten. We would like us to have a legislative text already presented next month, if it can be at Ecofin on January 27; that would be very positive.

Further we see how these markets are very often not used to create, generate a virtuous economy, but to simply create bets and speculations. So I think that the popular will is already very clear on the objective that politics must set itself and therefore it is all a matter of our will, of all the Member States, not only European but also globally, to try to put an end to this inequality.

This shows how these institutions, like the Commission, like the Council, are outdated institutions that are unable to respond and make legislative proposals to overcome the problems of citizens. Once again, the financial transaction tax proves this.

It is also fair to say that since 2011 the percentage share of tax that has come into the EU from the corporate sector has increased – much of it as a consequence of the OECD agenda. I was glad to hear the Presidency refer to the fact that those Member States not participating in the Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) proposal would also have their views heard and listened to.  From my perspective, there are three major problems with this. One is displacement: if you have a system where there is a tax in some financial centres and not in others, that will lead to displacement and could actually lead to an unintended consequence in terms of money going offshore. But secondly, there is a real concern in my own Member State about the secondary debt markets, as to the negative impact that this could have in terms of increased liquidity and also in terms of reduced investor demand.  My final remark is this. In my country, we have a financial transaction tax. It is a 1% stamp duty on the transaction of shares with incorporated Irish businesses. It took in half a billion last year. The Commission proposal is 0.1%.

In future, the EU budget is no longer to be financed with contributions from the budget of the member states but directly with taxes. This is the conclusion reached by Mario Monti today in a report that he prepared in his role as Chairman of the High-Level Group “Own Resources” on behalf of the Council and the Commission. Mr. Monti sees a number of energy and climate-related taxes and duties as suitable for financing the EU, but corporate and transport taxes are also compliant as sources of income for the EU budget: a harmonized corporate income tax, a uniform value added tax, a bank tax - the Banks will be happy about another levy - and also the financial transaction tax discussed today, which can be a very important point for a budget. The financial transaction tax is planned as a progressive tax on financial transactions in securities and derivatives, which, as already mentioned, is to be introduced by the ten member states as part of increased cooperation. An EU-wide solution is currently not envisaged, nor is a global solution, which would be best. Their optimism in full honor, but also in the group of ten, the implementation is dragging on, so that the media are already talking of a first-class funeral for the financial transaction tax. The tax could bring in income of up to 35 billion annually, with a broad scope and a very low tax rate, combining both steering and financing purposes and be a gushing source of income for Mr Monti's entire European tax plans. The reality is different: the tax will not be determined in January of this year either - unfortunately - because there is still no impact assessment for banks and insurance companies, financial service providers and pension funds.

The whole idea of ​​a financial transaction tax goes directly against what we want to achieve through a capital market union. To get more investments, more entrepreneurship and new jobs.

However, on the other hand, many also do not understand that taxes are very easy to pass on to others. And after all, the weakest always pull the shorter end.

Migrants and refugees in Europe are facing the harshest winter conditions we have seen in decades, from the Aegean islands to the north of Europe. In some parts of Europe, this was not expected. We have all seen the images in the press of many of the refugee camps and let me be clear: nobody should feel proud of this situation. Our moral obligation is to offer these people dignity. Today. Not next week. Not even tomorrow. We are therefore assisting the authorities in their response on all the urgent actions that need to be taken by Greece in order to accelerate the winterisation of the camps. Both my dear colleague Commissioner Avramopoulos and I are in regular contact with the Greek authorities. On the Greek islands, where the situation is most serious, we are exploring all possible solutions to assist the government and the local authorities in these extraordinary times. Commissioner Avramopoulos was in Lesbos earlier today, to assess the situation on the ground and, of course, to discuss and find immediate solutions.  We welcome the quick response of the Greek authorities to deal with the difficult situation on the islands. First, to move the most vulnerable to winterised reception sites. Second, to transfer to the mainland asylum applicants – especially vulnerables – who cannot be returned to Turkey and who therefore have been referred to the regular asylum process. Third, to deploy a navy ship to accommodate those in need, especially in Lesbos, during the harsh weather conditions. Having said this, for the medium term, we are discussing with the Greek authorities the creation of appropriate shelters, including closed facilities on the islands, as well as the improvement of existing infrastructure. As my dear colleague Dimitris Avramopoulos mentioned to me and said today in Lesbos, this solution will only work in cooperation and with the support of the local authorities and, of course, of the local populations in the islands who have demonstrated immense generosity to hundreds and thousands of refugees and migrants in the last two years.  We stand ready to provide available funding to create this additional accommodation capacity and we have communicated this to the national and local authorities. We did so in the mainland, in partnership with UNHCR and other humanitarian actors and other humanitarian partners.  The European Union humanitarian aid partners – UN agencies, international organisations and NGOs – are also on the ground assisting. Over 200 000 winterised items have been distributed to the refugees and migrants – sleeping bags, blankets, and clothing appropriate for cold weather. These are not of course long-term solutions, but these extraordinary times require extraordinary responses. We are monitoring the situation on the island closely and we will keep doing whatever is needed to support the Greek authorities for as long as it takes. On the mainland, the situation is very different. Winterisation can be considered to be under control. Thirty-one sites are already winterised with the help of the Emergency Support Instrument. This is my responsibility, through the Emergency Support Instrument, and thank you so much for your support in establishing this Emergency Support Instrument, which is managed by my services and DG ECHO. EUR 200 million were allocated last year in the humanitarian field alone, and 25% of this amount – more than EUR 50 million – has been provided to humanitarian aid partners for winterisation activities in Greece, in particular on the mainland, and of course to repair and improve existing shelters, to construct new ones, to improve sanitation conditions and to provide heating – the list is long. This is in addition to the funds already available. Since the beginning of 2015, EUR 352 in emergency assistance from the Home Affairs Funds were made available for Greece. This assistance, provided either directly to the national authorities or to EU agencies and international organisations, is aimed at directly supporting migration management in Greece, including its reception capacities and, of course, improving the camps on the mainland and islands. This emergency funding comes on top of the EUR 509 million already available to Greece under the national programmes for 2014-2020. Here, let me remind you that, overall, the European Union has made available over EUR one billion for Greece under the Home Affair Funds and the new Emergency Support Instrument. Greece is the biggest beneficiary of these EU funds. Let me now turn to Serbia and to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The Commission is using all possible tools to help the authorities cope with the refugee crisis, not least because these two countries are candidate states. Here we are also providing significant financial and technical support. I am aware of the huge difficulties due to the cold weather and heavy snowfall, especially in Serbia. I will be going to Serbia this weekend to assess the situation on the ground and to discuss with the authorities, meet with the refugees and express once again tangible European Union solidarity. Expanding the reception capacities and ensuring that existing centres are adequate for the winter has been a priority for us.  With more than EUR 43 million allocated to Serbia since October 2015, both through humanitarian aid and pre-accession assistance, the European Union is the largest donor. (EUR) 19 million of humanitarian assistance was granted to improve reception conditions, to winterise facilities, and to provide a warm meal and medical help. A further EUR 24 million financed through the Instrument for Pre-Accession is also helping Serbia to host these refugees and migrants and at the same time to reinforce its capacity to control its borders. This is part of over EUR 118 million in EU financial and technical support for Serbia in this field since 2007.  Of course, more needs to be done to provide safe and humane conditions for migrants, including through the expansion of reception capacity. We stand ready to help and this is why I am going there at the weekend to negotiate and discuss matters with the Serbian authorities in order to improve the situation on the ground. The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is hosting around 200 refugees. Since the crisis broke out in 2015, the Commission has allocated EUR 19 million specifically to help the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia cope with the refugee crisis, including in humanitarian assistance. This is part of over EUR 50 million in EU financial and technical support for the country since 2007 in the field of border, migration and asylum management. We will consider additional funds as needs arise.  This is the situation in the three countries referred to – Greece, Serbia and FYROM – and course I would like to say again that we are not proud of this very painful situation. The European Union allocated enough money, but through some weaknesses on the ground this money was not utilised in the best way in order to deal with this unprecedented situation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 184, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Agustín DÍAZ DE MERA GARCÍA CONSUEGRA", "mepid": "28397", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Madam President, I sincerely congratulate you on having renewed the confidence of the House.

An over-concentration due to the fact that NATO and Frontex, instead of restricting refugee flows, are literally the traffic warden. Overcrowding due to the fact that out of the 66,400 refugees who were supposed to be relocated to other Union countries, only 8,000 have been relocated. An over-concentration due to the fact that the examination of asylum applications takes too much time, since the European Union, although it promised to send hundreds of experts to assist the Greek authorities, has not done so. Mr. Stylianidis, we denounced in all tones the fact that the government left thousands of refugees in the snow, especially in Moria, Lesvos, but also in Ritsona. However, the situation in Samos, but also in Chios, where I was at the weekend, is not better, even though the famous NGOs have received hundreds of millions of euros to support the refugees.

I realise that the relocation from Greece and Italy has not worked. Therefore, in the Dublin Regulation that I am responsible for and currently working on, I will try to present some ideas on how we can solve some of these issues, but these are long-term solutions. What we need to see now are emergency measures to assist all refugees on our continent – both those in Member States and those who are stuck in the countries of the Western Balkans. I hope that Member States and the Commission will do all that they can to provide the necessary assistance, because today we need both emergency measures and passion and compassion for those in need.

There are children with frostbite inside the European Union in the 21st Century, and we seem to be unable to help effectively. How could we let this happen in our own European Union for which we are all, together, responsible? I think a big part of it is the logic of trying to keep asylum seekers, migrants, refugees, whatever, out, and treating them badly, to stop them coming. We accept that people suffer so that others might be deterred, but is this really the Europe that we want to live in? Is this the Europe that we imagined when we were running for this position, for example, and is this really acceptable to us? For me it is not and I believe for many of you it is not either. But if it is not acceptable, then we have to get real, we have to transfer refugees from the islands to the Greek mainland. The big problem here is the Turkey deal, because of the limitations it puts when Turkey will only accept back refugees that come from the islands. But we put ourselves – or not us, but the Council and the Member States put themselves in this situation and they are putting pressure on Greece not to transfer refugees to the mainland. We know that. That is why people are stuck on the islands, where there is no accommodation – nothing whatsoever. We need to relocate, relocate and relocate. Only 6.4% of the 160 000 people promised have been relocated so far. This is nothing. Again, we need the Member States to act on that. But it is not just Greece, it is also Serbia, Macedonia and Bulgaria where we need to step up efforts of reception and accommodation.

We in Sweden should not be forced to support asylum seekers just because they happened to pass Greece as the first country, which is the situation now. In Sweden, we also had to set up tent camps last winter. This is because we took an excessive responsibility and let in almost everyone who went to Sweden.

Already, the evidence shows that the majority of these people receive adequate care with material support, but also with additional staff. However, as the weather conditions have reached the extreme limits of the Greek state mechanism, we must decide, as soon as possible, to provide additional assistance to the areas affected by the bad weather, as we do in all cases of natural disasters.

Elena Valenciano spoke about the limbo, and in this limbo what we have to try and do is make people’s lives as comfortable and as near to normal as possible. One of the ways to do that is to get people onto some kind of cash voucher scheme. Instead of people having to get their food provided by kitchens, and having to queue up at soup kitchens, we can give them cash to buy local food that helps them lower the costs and also gives a bit more dignity. I wonder if there is any update on the progress there, and also on the issue of children and education. There are many children who have been out of education for many years.

It was definitely a painful discussion because all of us feel very uncomfortable about the situation. Nobody should feel proud of this situation, especially because of our moral framework, because all of us, we know well and we want to offer these people dignity in this very unprecedented situation.  Let me take this opportunity to repeat that the Commission is committed to helping the authorities of the countries concerned in their response. This is why Commissioner Avramopoulos was in Lesbos and in Greece today to talk with the Greek authorities. This is why I am going to Serbia on Saturday, in order to meet with the Serbian authorities and to discuss all things, from unaccompanied minors to the conditions of the refugees, even in Belgrade. Through our various funding instruments we are ready to respond to additional needs. I can say now that in Serbia on Saturday I will announce additional funding, especially to support our humanitarian partners on the ground, with the collaboration, of course, of the Serbian authorities, because we strongly believe that no one should remain in the cold in these conditions.  I completely agree with you that in these very challenging days for the European project we can send our EU citizens the message that we are ready to make a difference in order to provide assistance to these vulnerable people. EU citizens want to see actions, not words, and our success in these very difficult circumstances will be measured by how effectively we can work together. Here, I would like to say a big thank you to this House for its support, because today I saw that you are ready to give us support in order to continue on this difficult road. Of course, regardless of the emergency situation – and we have to meet this emergency situation – in these challenging times we should not forget the need for longer-term solutions. I call on all other EU Member States, through, of course, the Maltese Presidency, to continue stepping up the number of people they relocate from Greece and Italy.  Member States should also deliver on their commitments and deploy their asylum experts for a sufficiently long period of time. I completely agree with my dear friend Mr Kyrkos that the situation regarding experts on the ground is unacceptable. So far, on average only half of the experts requested are present on the ground.  I admit that the EU-Turkey Agreement has some controversial parts but, at the same time, it has allowed us to put a stop to the countless deaths at sea. But here I would like to emphasise that this refugee crisis is not a national problem. It is not a Greek, an Italian, a Serbian, or a Spanish problem; it is a European problem and its solution remains a collective European responsibility. This is why we have to insist on having a common European position and we have to, of course, ask the international community to help us in this condition because it is also a global issue. It is also a global responsibility.  I would like to focus on some issues. I totally agree with Linda McAvan about the cash voucher scheme. From my experience on the ground, I saw that this is the only way to offer dignity to refugees. This is why it is one of my top four priorities in Greece, along with shelter, education of course, and special care for unaccompanied minors. In this way we give, first and foremost, dignity to these people, as I already said. This is the foundation for everyone in order to deal with the situation when they come as refugees. From my experience also, and from my staff’s evaluation, this is much more cost-effective and efficient than any other scheme, and especially the catering services which are currently provided in Greece.  The cash voucher scheme also supports the local markets, the local economies, and this is why we established in Turkey the ESSN project for one million Syrian refugees inside Turkey. The Greek Minister for Migration, Mr Mouzalas, has publicly announced the transition to this scheme, from catering services to cash and voucher, by March. We should not delay this transition.  I would like to thank Mr Moraes for his kind words. As I said, there are funds available. If the space is given, we will support new shelters. If another ship comes to host refugees we could support that too. This is why we are in daily contact with the Greek authorities through Commissioner Avramopoulos and Mr Verwey from our services. We find daily that the solution is not easy but we give our soul to achieve the best and I think this is what we need.  I would also like to focus the issue of the transfer of refugees and migrants from the Aegean islands to the mainland, which many of you raised. After considerable talks with the Greek authorities, we decided to transfer vulnerable people at least, in order to avoid a deterioration in the situation.

I would like to say that for a long time the Commission had not seen fit to present a proposal related to the need to analyze and assess the situation of freight transport within what is now the general situation of mobility, infrastructure and transport European, more dedicated to the part of passenger transport than to that of goods. In this sense, at the present time, in which there is growth through, on the one hand, the opening of Panama and, on the other, the opening of Suez, and above all, let's say, the different aspects of electronic commerce and rise of the new social masses, who are precisely demanding the way to exports in Europe, we need, of course, to make an assessment of the current situation. And there we find, in relation to the free movement of people, goods and services, with the appearance of national regulations that tend to create new obstacles, without the Commission having so far managed to establish a clear and evident framework to avoid this type of obstacles and mobility problems. Also in this sense, we need a strategy with a whole series of points that give more coherence to national and European Union legislation, where the importance of urban nodes and specific urban logistics also appears, and to ensure that the financing of the new financial framework that will begin to be negotiated in 2017 recognizes all these needs. We also need, and we see with interest, how the Commission is also taking an interest in improving them, improving cross-border transport and, above all, in particular, the missing links in my region - for example, everything related to the Canfranc crossing -, and also correct the links railways to sea, river ports or airports. In the case of Spain, the Cantabrian-Mediterranean corridor would also interest me in that sense. And above all, also facilitate the capillarity - it is one of the demands of the industry - of the global network towards the basic network and the corridors, and the fundamental role of multimodal platforms in trans-European networks. A series of ideas or attempts at solutions: in the European Semester, the need to make national plans more coherent with the plans that the same Member States have signed in Brussels, and which often do not correspond; the proposal of the golden rule, that is, that the obligation to co-finance European infrastructures does not carry weight in public debt, specifically. Also, that the coordinators focus on the freight transport aspects in their corresponding corridors, and that on a biannual basis we can evaluate with the Commission what is done in those corridors in relation to the improvement of intermodality in the field of transport of goods. goods. We are also concerned about the need for investments in the maintenance of these infrastructures, not only the construction of new infrastructures, and that is why we also thank Mr. Katainen for accepting that all investment related to maintenance and upgrading of motorways and roads could be part of the new EFSI. We support, of course, the continuity of the Digital Transport and Logistics Forum, especially with all aspects of innovation, digitization, simplification, and above all to avoid this redundant legislation that is adding layers to the national, regional and local with new proposals for European directives and standards. Of course, we want to facilitate the development of ports and the systems that link and improve security, especially those such as Galileo and EGNOS, and secure funding for them. that we are not always anxious about its continuity. To this end, we also ask the Commission for specific funding for freight transport and a specific call, which we hope will be in 2017, for logistics projects. Also, that projects in urban nodes are supported and facilitated through good practices, precisely related to urban logistics, so necessary, that avoid pollution, noise and congestion. We also highlight the need for new technologies such as automation, drones, etc., which are to be increasingly integrated into logistics and freight transport, have a fluid relationship with conventional vehicles and also with users. , increasingly vulnerable.

It makes it possible to create interconnections between national networks, to build transport infrastructure in the service of economic growth. But this policy which brings people together must also have an environmental dimension. Too many sectors are now heavily disrupted in terms of pollution and therefore in terms of health by the high rate of carbon emissions from our transport. We therefore need to make further progress on the path to decarbonising transport in Europe. Until recently, the Alpine valleys around Mont Blanc have experienced nearly 50 days of air quality pollution, not just from transport but also from transport. So together we have a challenge to take up, which is that of new forms of transport, the development of low-carbon intermodality, which means that we have to trust new technologies and invest more in research.

These elements are vital for the efficiency, service quality and sustainability of transport, and therefore for jobs, growth and investment in the European Union.  I think we are already on track to take up the challenges set out in the report prepared by Parliament. Multimodality and logistics are strong components of our TEN-T policy. Trans-European transport corridors support a more integrated, multimodal freight transport and logistics. The TEN-T guidelines and the Connecting Europe Facility regulation address a broad range of aspects referred to in our report. Allow me to highlight the most important ones.  All transport modes are covered. The removal of bottlenecks on railway lines, as well as inland waterways, are identified as investment priorities for European long—distance transport. In the road sector, the focus lies especially on increasing efficiency through innovative technologies, safe and secure driving and parking conditions, as well as the smooth integration into multimodal transport chains. Intelligent transport systems are included for all modes in order to enable a more efficient infrastructure use, to promote new—generation user services for passengers and freight, as well as automation and digital solutions. Under our TEN-T policy, network nodes and the connection of transport modes are given reinforced importance, including at terminals, ports and airports. Urban nodes and urban logistics infrastructure are amongst the newest elements of TEN-T corridors. They allow investments in efficient multimodality and freight logistics and, thereby, also contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, infrastructure for clean fuels, such as natural gas, hydrogen and electricity, forms an integral part of TEN-T infrastructure. EU funding under the Connecting Europe Facility supports various types of projects, from large-scale infrastructure to very targeted intelligent transport system projects, clean fuel solutions or access infrastructure to multimodal terminals. While the TEN-T corridors are a top priority, attention is also given to the complementarity between the core and comprehensive networks. The Core Network Corridors approach has proven an effective tool to identify obstacles to efficient and seamless freight transport flows. The corridors’ completion continues to require substantial investment to remove physical bottlenecks which still hamper smooth flows of passengers and goods. EU funding until 2020 and beyond, including the mobilisation of private investment through the European Fund for Strategic Investment (EFSI), remains a key element to address the investment gap to meet the needs in transport sectors with focus on TEN-Ts. We estimate the needs to complete the TEN-T core network to be EUR 700 billion by 2030. Thus we need to mobilise all sources of private and public funds. For example, we are going to launch a EUR one billion CEF Blending call next month to combine grant funds with EFSI financing whenever possible, and private funds to fund projects in line with TEN-T priorities. An efficient and sustainable transport system is key to making full use of the internal market and to generating new jobs and economic growth. Remaining administrative and technical barriers in and between modes of transport and national systems should also be removed. Once again, I wish to thank and congratulate you on your report. On behalf of my colleague, Violeta Bulc, the Commission welcomes that the European Parliament attaches importance to the TEN-T and the good functioning of logistics in the EU. We know we can count on your support to Connect Europe.

It is therefore difficult to overestimate the economic impact of freight transport logistics and its contribution to the growth and competitiveness of the European economy. EU logistics and freight transport policy should aim to increase opportunities to maintain a favorable environment, remove barriers and exploit the potential for growth and employment in this sector in the light of emerging economic and social trends, dynamic technological change and increasing international trade. Rising energy prices, the need to reduce CO2 emissions, competition in the skilled labor market in an aging society, accelerating digitalisation, automated and autonomous vehicles and operations, increasingly integrated supply chains, and wider use of containers all present a range of challenges and opportunities. I therefore agree with the need to optimize the development of freight transport infrastructure on the TEN-T, especially in heavily congested areas, in order to incorporate innovative urban logistics strategies. We need to re-evaluate the methodology and criteria for developing freight transport networks and ensure that investment is made, in particular, in alternative freight transport routes connecting less congested hubs, terminals, airports and ports, as well as environmental protection and noise reduction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 251, "date": "2017-01-18.json", "name": "Ivan JAKOVČIĆ", "mepid": "124754", "text": "written. - We are aware of the need to strengthen TEN-T networks, and encourage real digitalization of transport with a new safety system and the use of new forms of energy in transport.

In this context, I consider logistics to be extremely important in order to guarantee efficient and sustainable freight transport in the EU. Investments in urban hubs are particularly important, as is the promotion of rail links with industrial plants and improved interconnections between railways and seaports, river ports and inland hubs. Regional networks should not remain outside the European perspective, including in terms of financial and regulatory measures, and investments are therefore needed to complete the links between the Union's main corridors.

Across Europe, more than 11 million people are employed in logistics, accounting for almost 14% of EU GDP. The freight transport sector is expected to grow in the future, which is why we are calling for its modernization. This is also linked to the European Commission's commitment, which stated in its White Paper on Transport that 30% of road freight transport over 300 km should be transferred to rail or waterborne transport by 2030. In order to achieve this goal, it will be necessary for the Member States to ensure the development of their infrastructure. The precondition for the establishment of a multimodal infrastructure is given by the TEN-T framework, but the coordination of its fulfillment is still insufficient. In particular, Member States will need to reduce regulatory, operational and technical barriers. In addition, progress should be made in introducing new technologies, coming up with digital solutions or even automatically controlled means of transport.

The efficiency and sustainability of freight transport logistics plays an important role in the proper functioning of many other services and activities in our economy, ranging from the production of goods for delivery or even the recycling of materials. The European logistics sector contributes to the growth of the European Union's GDP to around 14% and employs over 11 million workers in the European Union. Therefore, it is very important to support and develop the logistics sector. One solution is the TEN-T transport corridor. The purpose of developing the TEN-T network is to ensure the territorial cohesion of the EU and to facilitate the free movement of people and goods. An efficiently functioning transport system within the EU is to contribute to improving the operation of the single internal market, stimulate the economic growth of the region, and increase the competitiveness of individual Member States and the entire EU on a global scale. Thanks to the TEN-T corridor, the demand for transport services is expected to recover and by 2020 it is estimated that it will recover the level from before the economic crisis of 2008.
