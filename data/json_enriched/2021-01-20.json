They and many other Europeans spared no effort and spilled their blood to help build freedom and democracy in America, and hundreds of thousands of Americans spilled their blood twice last century to protect freedom and democracy in Europe. Ever since, the United States has been our closest ally in defending democracy and rule of law. American democracy has stood strong and often served as an example for advocates of freedom around the world, and this is why the events at the US Capitol shocked us so much. But the darkness of violence will never dim the light of democracy. Law, order and democracy have prevailed over this disgraceful attempt to overturn the election. American democracy has proven its strength and resilience, and today Joe Biden takes the oath of office as the 46th President of the United States. This will be, I hope, a day of peaceful transition and a great day for American democracy, like it has been for over two centuries. Dear Members of the Parliament, today is more than a transition. Today is an opportunity to rejuvenate our transatlantic relationship, which has greatly suffered in the last four years. In these years, the world has grown more complex, less stable and less predictable. This requires, more than ever before, that we Europeans take our fate firmly into our own hands to defend our interests and promote our values. A Europe that plays a stabilising and constructive role on the global scene in line with our true weight in the world; a stronger Europe to contribute to a better, fairer and greener world; a stronger Europe in defence and in preserving peace and security. And to do this, we need strong and reliable partners, and this is why the European Council reaffirms the strategic importance of our partnership with the United States as the world’s foremost and closest relationship. We share values, common interests, cultural and historical ties, and a geopolitical reality. Together we must stand as the bedrock of the rules-based international order working for peace, security, prosperity, freedom, human rights and gender equality – values harshly challenged in the world. Dear Members of the Parliament, on the first day of his mandate, I address a solemn proposal to the new US President: let’s build a new founding pact for a stronger Europe, for a stronger America, and for a better world. Je voudrais adresser de manière solennelle aujourd’hui, en ce jour d’entrée en fonction de Joe Biden, un appel à construire ensemble un pacte fondateur nouveau pour une Europe plus forte, pour des États-Unis plus forts et pour un monde meilleur. Dear colleagues, we should work on five priorities: first, boosting multilateral cooperation; second, combating COVID-19; third, tackling climate change; fourth, rebuilding our economies, ensuring fair trade and promoting the digital transformation; and fifth, joining forces on security and peace. This won’t be easy, but together we are up to the challenge.  The EU and US, we have our differences, and these will not magically disappear. America seems to have changed, and how it is perceived in Europe and the rest of the world has also changed. Likewise, the way the United States views the European Union may also have to change. The EU chooses its course and does not wait for permission to take its own decisions. Still, what unites us is so much greater than what divides us, and the events of 6 January have revealed that we share one particular challenge in common: protecting democracy and the rule of law. 6 January was a lesson to us all – a wake-up call – that even in our well—established democracies we too often take democracy and the rule of law for granted. Protecting democracy requires constant vigilance and constant work to foster cohesion in our societies. This is true in America, and it is true right here in Europe. Mesdames et Messieurs, chers collègues, ce nouvel agenda pour l’Europe et pour les États-Unis que nous souhaitons mettre sur la table est un agenda ambitieux et c’est pourquoi, en ce premier jour de son mandat, je souhaite inviter le président Biden en Europe pour participer à une réunion extraordinaire du Conseil européen à Bruxelles, réunion qui pourrait se tenir en parallèle à un sommet de l’OTAN. Vous le voyez, nous sommes prêts, nous voulons être rassemblés, nous voulons être mobilisés pour travailler ensemble avec les États-Unis, pour construire un pacte nouveau fondateur pour une Europe forte, pour des États-Unis forts et pour un monde meilleur.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Ursula von der Leyen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Commission. – Mr President, in all beginnings there dwells a magic force.   There is a magic in every beginning. I cannot help but think of this famous line of the poet, Hermann Hesse, when looking forward to the inauguration of Joe Biden in a few hours from now.  Joe Biden's oath will be a message of healing for a deeply divided nation, and it will be a message of hope for a world that is waiting for the US to be back in the circle of like—minded states. This time-honoured ceremony, on the steps of the US Capitol, will be a demonstration of the resilience of American democracy and the resounding proof that, once again, after four long years, Europe has a friend in the White House, and he will be standing next to Kamala Harris, the first woman to be Vice-President of the United States. This is a historic achievement and this also makes this day very special.  This new dawn in America is the moment we've been waiting for so long. Europe is ready for a new start with our oldest and most trusted partner, and this is why the Commission has recently adopted a new forward—looking transatlantic agenda. It focuses on where we can, together, join forces to push for global change, based on our common values, interests and global influence. From climate change to health, from digitalisation to democracy, these are global challenges that need renewed and improved global cooperation. The European Union and the United States must lead from the front and bring an alliance of like—minded partners with us.  There is of course no greater need for global cooperation in the short term than in tackling the pandemic, which has been so devastating on both sides of the Atlantic. As you know, the European Union has been leading the global response since day one, and it was so encouraging that so many US organizations and foundations have helped build and design the COVAX Facility, our global alliance to bring vaccine to the low and middle-income countries. Now I am looking forward to the US government joining our common effort. This will be a strong message. Beyond this, we will propose to the United States to step up our work on health prevention, preparedness and response at the G20 Health Summit in Rome in May.  I'm delighted that, on day one as they, the new American administration, announced, the United States will rejoin the Paris Agreement. This will be a very strong starting point for our renewed cooperation, and of course way more is to come. We want to deepen our partnership on emission trading and carbon pricing, we want to join forces with the United States to fight the loss of biodiversity and the destruction of nature. We want to develop the technologies that will drive us to climate neutrality. It is with this new green tech alliance that we will look forward at everything from offshore to climate change, from hydrogen that is clean to sustainable batteries and to circular economies that we have to build up to fight this climate change. We will be ready to engage from day one on.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The relief many of us feel about the change of office in Washington should not obscure one thing: President Trump may be history in a few hours, but his supporters will remain. More than 70 million Americans voted for Trump in the election. Just a few days ago, a few hundred of them stormed the Capitol in Washington, the heart of American democracy. These television pictures were a shock to all of us. This is what it looks like when words become deeds. This is what it looks like if the rapid digital spread of hate messages and fake news is becoming a threat to democracy. We should see these images from the United States as a reminder, despite all the primal confidence in our European democracy. We, as Europeans, are not immune from such developments. On the contrary. They have been around for a long time. Last August, a few hundred right-wing extremists wanted to storm the Berlin Reichstag. It was only thanks to the courage and prudence of a handful of police officers that they did not succeed. And we remember Jo Cox. The British Labour MP was murdered by a far-right perpetrator in June 2016, in the heated days leading up to the Brexit referendum – an act that still stifies today. Of course, there are differences to the storm on Capitol Hill. But there are also people here who feel disadvantaged, who are angry, people who adhere to rampant conspiracy theories, an often confusing melange of completely abstruse brains. And, of course, there is also social media here, which spread this hatred and contempt for our democracy millions of times unfiltered. Ladies and gentlemen, of course we must respond to the concerns and needs of each and every one of our citizens. Your fears, for example, fully justified – to be economically dependent in the pandemic. We will do this, for example with the multi-billion dollar NextGenerationEU investment and reconstruction programme. In the end, however, we may not be able to convince everyone that there are no dark powers at work in our democracies. But there is one thing we, as politicians, can and must do: we must ensure that these hate messages and misinformation can no longer spread unchecked. We must democratically enshrine the unbridled and uncontrolled power – that is a political power – of the large Internet corporations. For in a world where polarizing opinions have the greatest chance of being heard, the path from offside conspiracy theories to dead police officers is not far away. Unfortunately, the storm on the Capitol has shown that, too. Let me first make one thing clear, so that we do not get a false tongue-in-side into our debate: we in Europe value innovation. We are enthusiastic about the possibilities of state-of-the-art technology. We are open to new things, because without the new, without innovation, without the advances in technology, there is no tomorrow, we will not be able to keep what is important to us. But new technologies must never lead to others determining how we live, and that is what this is all about. As you know, the Commission launched the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act in December. Roughly simplified, we want to achieve that in future online is banned, which is also prohibited in the analogue world. We want the platforms to create transparency about how their algorithms work. For it is not acceptable for decisions that have far-reaching effects on our democracy to be taken by arithmetic programmes that no human being controls. And we want clear guidelines that Internet companies take responsibility for the content they distribute. Because that, too, is important to me. As true as it may have been, Twitter shut down Donald Trump's account five minutes after 12 – such serious interference with freedom of expression should be done on the basis of laws, not the rules of the game of corporations, based on the decision of parliaments, politicians, not Silicon Valley executives. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. Especially in the field of digital, we have a lot to offer in Europe to the new government in Washington. Our European path can set an example for international policy-making – just as our General Data Protection Regulation has been for a long time. As a first step, I can imagine, for example, a joint Trade and Technology Council. Together, we can create a global rule book for the digital economy – from data protection and privacy to the security of critical infrastructure. A set of rules based on our values: human rights and pluralism, inclusion and the protection of privacy. Honourable Members, this day brings good news. The United States are back, and Europe stands ready to reconnect with an old and trusted partner to breathe new life into our cherished alliance.

Four years of splitting societies, of fake news, even of the escalation of violence against the institutions who represent our democracy, are now behind us. The first message, while still having the pictures of the Congress and the Senate in America in mind; the unbelievable pictures from the office of Nancy Pelosi or the plenary of the Senate. The main message for me, is first of all, that as a Member of a Parliament, the European Parliament, as elected Members of a Parliament, we are close to our colleagues in Washington. We are together defending the institutions, the Parliament, as a heart of democracy – we will always fight for it. I think it would be arrogant in these times to try to give our American friends any kind of lesson. We are facing similar – even the same – challenges. The first was already expressed by our Commission President: social media, the digital world. I think the new way of communication has made these things possible. It is a fact that compromise is boring in a social media feed and an extreme position of provocation is attractive, it is re-tweeted. That is a reality, and this has a lot of impact in our daily life, as politicians in our political life. The big tech giants need clear rules, and the business of the big tech giants must be to serve societies and not destroy our European way of life. A second consideration for me is that more than 70 million people still voted for Donald Trump. Around half of American society. That is the real challenge: how to win them back to serious centre—based politics. I think it would be wrong to attack them as populistic voters. I think we have to take their concerns seriously.  To ask for a strict control of the border is not radical, to ask for regulation of the globalisation, with regard to China, is not radical and to defend American jobs is also not radical. We have to take their concerns seriously. The third point I want to mention is – yes – we will have a restart of the transatlantic relationship with Joe Biden in office, and President Michel if you will allow, I think it would be great to have Joe Biden in a Council meeting; but the better option for having Joe Biden in Europe to present his ideas for the future of the transatlantic relationship would be to have him make a speech in the European Parliament, probably in Strasbourg, because he’s aware of Europe’s history. That could be a really great place to restart. But, this restart also means for us as Europeans to be prepared, and there I have some thoughts, for example, on security, about NATO cooperation. Are we really ready to build up our European defence pillar; are we really ready to give in and to invest more?  On trade, I still have the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) discussions in mind. We have to learn from the mistakes we made about transparency, for example, on the TTIP debate eight years ago. In the TTIP debate, there were a lot of anti—European arguments on the table as well. Are we really prepared for a restart? That is what we have to reflect upon. The last point I want to mention is, having the developments in America in mind, we together have to define a clear red line as to what extremism is all about and to fight against violence in politics. We did it in the European Parliament last year with the rule of law mechanism to establish a binding mechanism where we defend the values of the European way of life and defend our institutions. The European Union is about being united in diversity, that is our main message and the same message could also be for our American transatlantic relationship: ‘united in diversity’. Let’s defend our common values and our institutions.

The assault on the Capitol is the appalling result of populist national rhetoric to undermine the foundations of civil and peaceful coexistence within American society. All democracies are vulnerable, even those we thought were stronger. American democracy is strong and will overcome this crisis. President Biden and Vice President Harris should help create a climate of concord that heals the wounds of division and polarization. Rejection abroad, racism, aversion to women, anti-Semitism, denial of climate change or anti-vaccine activism represent the delusions of an increasingly present far right in Western democracies. Together with this iliberal ideology, which advocates fear of the different, let us not forget that the growth of inequalities, tax evasion, deind industrialization and high unemployment have also, of course, contributed to millions of people in the United States and the European Union losing faith in democracy. It is time to understand that ignoring the scourge of inequality represents not only an unacceptable injustice from a moral point of view but also the origin of the worst political cataclysm of the last lustro, from Brexit to Trumpism. We see populsmos in turn fueled by a nativist ideology that rejects societies of equal human beings in rights. The horrific scenes of the Capitol also show that we need to fight misinformation more effectively and guarantee citizens' right to truthful information. The digital services law proposed by the Commission should help us regulate the removal of illegal content from online platforms with full respect for freedom of expression. Another challenge shared with the Biden and Harris Administration is the reconstruction of a multilateral system that ensures respect for democratic norms and institutions. In the Social Democratic family we are committed to a revitalized Transatlantic Partnership. We need to formulate joint strategies under the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the Nuclear Agreement with Iran, the World Health Organization, the World Trade Organization. Let us not fall into a false debate which forces us to choose between the European agenda and the transatlantic agenda. A European Union with strategic autonomy would be the best partner for the United States. On both sides of the Atlantic we have to learn that democracies are built every day.

No democracy in the world is immune to these dangers. In Europe there are numerous politicians that flirt with the same recipe and it is our duty to stand by our values, confront them and call a lie a lie.  Dear colleagues, today’s inauguration of the 46th President, Joe Biden, and of the Vice-President, Kamala Harris, gives a new opportunity to the United States and to the transatlantic partnership. It is an opportunity we Europeans and Americans cannot miss. We need to roll up our sleeves and reshape our long-standing partnership. Let’s put trade tensions behind us, as our farmers, for instance, are eager for a moratorium on the sanctions, and let’s build a common vision on how to deal with our common challenges. Let’s level up our commitment to fight climate change and openly discuss how to deal with digital giants — two very important files for both Europeans and Americans — and let’s identify how to support countries in the world to recover from the pandemic and back on track. And, most importantly, we Europeans should seize Mr Biden’s proposal to build an alliance of democratic countries that cherish freedom and respect human rights, while we in Parliament should be a strong partner for this initiative.

This desecration of the temple of American democracy is serious and the deaths, among the police as well as among the demonstrators, are all tragedies. Violating the symbolic institution of the US Congressional buildings is inexcusable, but this stormy demonstration was by no means a coup d'etat. Joe Biden lamented the unprecedented aggression of American democracy. He had said nothing when, a few months earlier, the same buildings were invaded by the radical extreme left and the Black Lives Matter movement. The other damning spectacle that should worry us is the exclusion by almost all social networks of a democratically elected and still-in-office president. This is an unprecedented historical assault on this essential democratic principle: respect for freedom of expression. Social media has disconnected Donald Trump, arrogating the exorbitant right to create new rules. They believe that the terms of use of their services take precedence over the constitution of sovereign states. Joe Biden shows his willingness to re-establish American world leadership with bellicose accents. This can only worry us after Donald Trump's tenure marked by years without military adventure, arguably his most significant accomplishment, after half a century of American military interventions at the whim of successive presidents. When Joe Biden says, and I quote, \"We have to prove to the world that the United States is ready to lead again, not only with the example of our power but also with the power of our example,\" it is arrogant, it is not America that we love. Beyond man and his style, Donald Trump's election defeat does not call into question the political agenda he has developed in the United States and which is, everywhere the planet, carried by people: regulation of the globalized economy, questioning the role of the policeman of the world of the United States, rejection of political correctness, listening to populations in the face of growing inequalities. These themes are those carried by the National Rally in France, the Lega in Italy, the AfD in Germany, all of our allies in Europe.

They were the direct result of Trump egging them on, but also of four years of daily lies, a contempt for facts, of relentless attacks on free media and portraying dissenting opinion as evil or a conspiracy. And this proves that even the strongest democracies are vulnerable when challenged on a steady and aggressive basis. I very much hope that the inauguration today goes well and smoothly, and I wish President Biden a lot of success. Dear colleagues, imagine that the riots to overturn a free and fair election would have happened here at the European Parliament or in the parliament of one of the Member States. Sounds unbelievable, sounds far away? But do we really think in Europe we are safe from the threats of populism and demagogues, from disinformation and attacks to overthrow the rule of law? Remember the Brexit campaign five years ago, filled with blatant lies and false promises. Think of the Polish Government’s unbelievable disregard for women’s ownership of their own bodies. Think of what we sometimes hear here in this Chamber. And perhaps most emblematic: don’t forget Viktor Orbán’s systematic dismantling of Hungary’s rule of law, blaming every imaginable or unimaginable foreign foe, from George Soros to migrants, to indeed the EU itself. And let’s keep all of this in mind when looking at the events across the Atlantic. Those events should inspire humbleness rather than fuel a false belief that we’re safe from all of this in the EU. We must learn from those shocking events in Washington. Firstly, we should take seriously those who announce that they want to destroy democracy. Many participants in the Capitol riots had announced their intentions in plain view. It shouldn’t have come as a surprise. Far-right groups are also underestimated in Europe. They commit murders, they purchase weapons, and yet there’s very little attention to what they’re planning. They are a real threat, both on this side and on the other side of the Atlantic. And secondly, let’s remember that democracies are fragile and are always ‘work in progress’, and the EU has not always been agile enough to prevent the erosion of rule of law in several Member States. We must relentlessly work to safeguard fundamental rights and rule of law. And thirdly, we need to look into the role of the social media tech giants in this crisis. Disinformation, amplified by algorithms, has divided societies and has even cost human lives. At the same time, the cooperative executives have acquired unbelievable power. So let’s bring social media under democratic scrutiny.

The new incumbents – and I wish them luck today – should refrain from criminalising dissent. Raising inconvenient questions is the core of democracy.

That is why Joe Biden's inauguration today is a good one for hope, but above all for expectations of a different policy of the United States. The shocking images of the storming of the Capitol and the failed coup attempt did not come out of nowhere, as other colleagues have already pointed out. Democracy in the US has been under constant attack from the White House over the past four years. Democracy is under threat, not only in the United States, where we have also seen the emergence of a new fascist movement, but democracy is also under attack in other regions, including here in the middle of the European Union, and enemies of democracy who have made common cause with Trump in recent years are also sitting in this House. Some have already spoken, but others will do so in the course of this debate. The transatlantic relationship must be turned back on its feet in the future, and from my group's point of view, there are very specific demands on the administration of Joe Biden, which should certainly meet with broad support here in this House as well. Firstly, a return to multilateralism: instead of further weakening international organisations such as the United Nations or the World Health Organisation, we need to strengthen them. Secondly, a common policy committed to climate protection. The announced re-entry of the US into the Paris agreement on climate change is a first step to be welcomed. Thirdly, joint work on a stable world peace order. This applies to relations with China as well as with Russia. But this also means nuclear disarmament and the re-entry of the United States into the anti-nuclear agreement with Iran. Fourthly, US policy must be geared towards the restoration and strengthening of democracy by defending citizens' rights and freedoms, but also by resolutely combating social inequality, which is increasingly gutting social cohesion in the United States, but also here in Germany, in the European Union. Anyone who really wants to protect democracy must finally find the courage to limit the economic and political power of the large corporations and the super-rich and to redistribute social prosperity.

The hope for a stable partner, equal to the geopolitical challenges that lie ahead, is that President Biden understands the malaise of American democracy and the socio-political dynamics that led to the capitol hill assault. When millions of people who believe that an election result is rigged choose to occupy the centre of political power, the first thing to do is to ask what caused this unease. The prevailing narrative, fueled not only by politicians but also by the media and experts, and attacks aimed at undermining the legitimacy of the Trump presidency have progressively eroded confidence in institutions, generating this dangerous boomerang. The path to reconciliation passes through an inclusive political debate, which returns to consider the demands of those 75 million liberal and conservative Americans, without disqualifying them from the outset. Therefore, freedom of expression and excessive power concentrated in the hands of some private individuals will be crucial issues in the coming months and will also affect the Old Continent very closely. In the long run, the prospect of turning social media into virtual ideological bubbles will contribute to further radicalisation of positions, coupled with inability and a lack of predisposition to dialogue and mutual respect.

Last summer, we witnessed the eruption of violence in many American cities with zones being occupied by the Antifa and BLM mob of Marxist extremists. The far left media and the Democrats call them peaceful protesters. However, when the protesters are not extreme Marxist terrorists, but patriots, suddenly they are called terrorists. One thing is sure: in history you either go down as a patriot or as a coward.

An American President who wants an independent and strong judiciary. And let me be clear: one can only defend the rule of law around the globe if one respects and defends the rule of law at home.  Now is the time for us as allies, the European Union and the United States of America, to defend human rights around the globe. The fundamentals of American democracy and of European democracy are the same: respecting existing rules and institutions, respecting the international order and our allies and, first and foremost, respecting our values. Challenging these values has only served autocrats in recent years.  America has a fresh start. Transatlantic relations have a fresh start. We should be looking forward, but we should also learn from the lessons of recent years, and the lesson is clear: fake news and hate policies are dangerous. They lead to violence. That is why we should also tell people here in Europe: stay away from extremism, stay away from hate policies, stay away from populism, stay away from lies. They are dangerous. To conclude, I would like to bring up an issue which is important to 30 million EU citizens.

The world watched transfixed as the shining city on a hill was ransacked and violated before our very eyes. The mob, after being egged on, enabled and encouraged for years, stormed the United States’ seat of democracy.  There are many lessons for us to learn here. In Europe, the shock gave way to realisation that the weight of the world’s democratic order now rests more heavily on our shoulders. It is true of course that the new administration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris brings with it new hope of better cooperation, of new Transatlantic expectation, of optimism and a return to normality. But Europe’s role on the world stage cannot be undervalued. Our belief in liberal democracy, founded in values and the rule of law, matters, not just to all our citizens, but to millions more people around the globe looking to us for hope. With increasing hostility to our east and uncertainty to our west, Europe matters. Standing up for the rule of law matters. Defending democracy matters. Leaders’ words matter.

The stability and prosperity of both sides of the Atlantic is deeply affected by our ability to work together. All of you have been expressing hopes, that we share, that a very good understanding of what Europe means for the US interest and policy is a cornerstone of our future relations.  We are also very much aware that in the past four years, they have delivered an important lesson for the EU for a policy engagement with the US. What has happened has to be taken into consideration in order to build our future relationship, and we should improve our capacity to anticipate the US internal drivers that at the end shape the US foreign policy. Certainly we have now a historic opportunity to rebuild and to reinforce our relationship, to effectively address together the needs and challenges of the 21st century. In the post-corona world, Transatlantic cooperation will revitalise the international rules-based order. As I said yesterday, you had to make multilateralism great again, based on our common values, interests, and pursuing global influence on the Western world.  Dear Members of the European Parliament, most of you have been expressing your convincement that a more assertive, more capable and more resilient Europe will be the best partner for the US. Enhancing Europe’s strategic autonomy will allow for a better cooperation when it comes to the security risks of today and those of the future, and I am sure that the new American administration will understand that and will put in practice a pragmatic framework for this new Transatlantic partnership.  You have been talking about the specific areas of cooperation: being partners and multilateralism. This will mean that we need to push for reforms of the United Nations organisations that preserve its democratic foundations, but being more ready, more able, to face pressing global problems. It’s very good news that the Paris Agreement will be accepted by the US as the framework to fight against climate change. Only with that the new Presidency will make a strong difference on the role of the US in the world.  Thank you very much for all your interventions. I think that together with the Council we will be able to build a new partnership based on dialogue among equals, to preserve the security and defence of democratic values in the world.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, this attack on the Capitol on 6 January, we followed it with amazement and experienced it as an electroshock which demonstrates the fragility of what we deeply believe in, because it is the DNA of the European project, the values of freedom, the rule of law, democracy.  If we choose it, this shock can be life-saving because a new page is now opening up in the United States that gives the ability, if we are committed, to be able to build with this ally to which we are attached for historical reasons, for reasons based on values, this new founding pact which must be an opportunity to be mobilised around the three pillars that must be the pillars for this European project.  On the one hand, the values of democracy, the rule of law, this constant, constant commitment. In recent months, in the European Parliament/Council debate, we have committed ourselves in Europe to make concrete progress to this commitment to governance and democracy. We must remain vigilant and committed to this issue. The second essential pillar is the prosperity we want, it is to improve our living environment by building on climate change as a lever to change the paradigm of our development, our ability to meet the needs of our fellow citizens. This idea indeed that we must support innovation, strongly support this ambition, climate neutrality by 2050 and the strengthening of the 2030 targets that we decided a few weeks ago in the Council. Finally, the third point I want to highlight is the commitment to a Europe mobilised globally, international cooperation, measuring what our strengths are and working to correct our weaknesses. A more resilient Europe, a more robust Europe, is the call I want to make on this symbolic, important day: the inauguration of a new presidential term in the United States. We open our arms, we reach out, we know of course that there will be sometimes difficult or tumultuous debates, but we share the essentials.

The bilateral relationship must be built with the desideratum of restoring a true multilateral order, especially in these trying times for humanity and for the planet we inhabit.

In less than a year families have been devastated by the loss of almost half a million human lives and we have been dragged into a devastating economic and social crisis across the 27 Member States. But this crisis has also proved the added value that the European Union is, in the access of all European citizens, on an equal footing, to the long-abid vaccine against COVID, in the joint and robust response to the economic and social crisis, in ensuring financial stability. I would like here to welcome the tireless work of the Commission, Parliament, the European Central Bank, Council President Charles Michel and the Croatian and German Presidencies in the European response to this dramatic crisis. The start of the vaccination process and the approval of the Multiannual Financial Framework and the Next Generation EU Programme open a door to hope. Portugal therefore assumes the Presidency of the Council at a decisive moment to set in motion, to implement, to implement the historic decisions we have taken in recent months. That's why we chose it as a motto: time to act: for a fair, green and digital recovery. A motto that sums up the three main priorities of the Portuguese Presidency: economic recovery, the development of the Social Pillar and the strengthening of the strategic autonomy of a Europe open to the world. The first condition of recovery is the success of the vaccination process. It is essential that we continue to work in coordination because we will only together overcome the virus, restoring full freedom of movement and the full potential of the internal market. But also the indispensable international solidarity for the eradication of the pandemic on a global scale, whether in our neighborhoods, on the African continent or in Latin America. At the same time, we must implement the instruments of economic and social recovery. On the one hand, the new Next Generation EU. This means that national parliaments must complete the ratification procedures for the Own Resources Decision, that this Parliament can vote on the regulation already agreed and that the 27 national recovery and resilience plans can be adopted. Because in order to overcome this crisis, we will only win it together throughout the Union. On the other hand, we must also start implementing the programmes of the new Multiannual Financial Framework, in particular those which, thanks to the determination of this European Parliament, have benefited from an important strengthening, such as Horizon Europe, EU4Health, or ERASMUS+.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the utmost attention that the fight against the pandemic requires us all does not allow us to neglect the strategic challenges we had and we still face. That is why the European recovery must be based on the drivers of the climate and digital transition. We're in a health emergency, but we're still in a climate emergency. We have a planet to protect and we can't afford to waste any more time. It is therefore urgent to implement the European Ecological Pact, from the outset by adopting the new Climate Law, which I take as one of our main political objectives. We are ready for the work we have left with you, ladies and gentlemen, to get a political agreement from this Parliament as soon as possible. This is indeed the decisive decade, which will require greater effort and ambition to achieve our commitment to achieve carbon neutrality in 2050. But this is also the decade of Digital Europe. A day without betting on digital is another day behind in this demanding global competition in which Europe has to be on the front line. In this sense, we will pay particular attention to the new Digital Services Package which the Commission has just presented and which offers us key legislative instruments for the protection of individual rights and democratic sovereignty and to bring greater competition to the digital market, stimulating empreendorism and creativity. In a moment, recovery cannot be limited to responding to the needs of the present with sets of stimuli for the conjuncture. The recovery must be based on investments and reforms that will allow us to emerge from this crisis more resilient, greener, more digital than we were before this crisis. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, climate and digital transitions are essential, undeferred and exciting social change. But I am very concerned about small and medium-sized enterprises and millions of European workers. Companies fear losing competitiveness by not being able to keep up with the investment effort that modernization requires. Workers fear for the future of their own job, new forms of work and the virtualization of social rights that have been hard won over the years. Therefore, in line with the European Parliament's report \"A Strong Social Europe for Fair Transitions\", our second priority is to implement the Social Pillar of the European Union as a basis for Europeanconfidence in Europe's ability to lead climate and digital transitions. We need to strengthen qualifications – new skills, upskilling, reskilling – so that our citizens are actors and not victims of these transitions. We need to invest more in innovation to strengthen the competitiveness of our businesses and we need to strengthen social protection to ensure that no one is left behind. The central event of our Presidency will be precisely the Social Summit, which we will organise in May, in the city of Porto, with the social partners, civil society, the Presidents of the Institutions and the Member States. The main objective of this Summit is to give a strong political impetus to the Action Plan that the Commission will present in March and which materialises the ambition expressed by our citizens to implement the 20 General Principles proclaimed in Gothenburg in 2017. There's no time to waste here either. Here too is time to act. The development of the Social Pillar is fundamental to giving confidence to Europeans that the changes we are living in are not a threat, but, they can and must be, an opportunity. The populism that undermines our democracies feeds on fear and realizing the Social Pillar is therefore the best vaccine against inequalities, fear and populism. Finally, our third priority will, as I have already said, strengthen the strategic autonomy of a European Union open to the world. As this pandemic has already been evidenced, Europe cannot be entirely dependent on the supply of essential goods on the part of third parties. We must therefore strengthen our strategic autonomy. This is a very demanding debate because it involves industrial policy, competition policy and trade policy. But that cannot mean either a protectionist drift or the myrific promotion of \"European champions\", wasting the enormous advantage of the capillarity of an economic system based on small and medium-sized enterprises and a system of research, development and innovation distributed across 27 Member States. Finally, strengthening strategic autonomy also means affirming Europe as a global actor, valuing, as our citizens are asked, the social and environmental standards that distinguish and distinguish us. We naturally want to continue to strengthen neighbourhood partnerships to the east and south, and the strategic partnership with the African continent and our transatlantic relations with the United Kingdom and the United States of America.  And on this day when President Joe Biden will take office, I cannot fail to address the best of his mandate and to mention the need to relaunch ever closer relations with the United States and also not forget that the United Kingdom, a new neighbour but an old Ally, will always remain a great partner of the European Union. The main hallmark of our presidency for the Indo-Pacific region will be to promote a closer and more strategic partnership between the world's two largest democracies, the European Union and India. We will host a European Union-India Summit also in the city of Porto, focusing on cooperation on digital, trade and investment, pharmaceuticals, science and space. One last word on a central issue of Europe's relationship with the world: migration. We are aware of the different existing sensitivities, but migrations are a reality since there are human beings on the planet. And so it will continue to be as long as the human species can survive. It is also undeniable that its management requires common European action. We must therefore continue work on the new Pact for Migration and Asylum, trying to strike the right balance between its internal and external dimensions, without forgetting legal migration. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it is time to act in the vaccination process, it is time to act on economic and social recovery, it is time to act to develop the Social Pillar, it is time to act to strengthen the strategic autonomy of a Union open to the world, but it is also time to act for the future of Europe. And that is why we need the Conference on the Future of Europe as a forum for debate between Member States and with our citizens about what we want to build together as a Union in the future. The Conference should focus on the anxieties and anxieties of citizens and not on the issues of the institutions. The Conference should be policy-oriented and the common responses to the strategic challenges we have to face in a world less Eurocentric. As the Presidency of the Council we will do everything we can to make sure that the Conference can be launched as soon as possible so that we can conclude it with an open and enlightening debate. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude.  It was the values of Europe that brought Portugal to Europe. It was the desire to consolidate the regained democracy, to be able to share a common area of freedom, security and peace, prosperity, after 48 years of dictatorship, the longest in Europe of the 20th century. , we will continue with ongoing processes in this area. The challenges ahead are immense. But on the basis of the work done by the Commission, Parliament and the Council, I believe that we are now all better prepared to overcome this pandemic, to overcome this unprecedented crisis and to build together a better future. That is why we assume the Presidency with a very clear motto: Time to act, for a fair, green and digital recovery.

Cette ville de renouvellement et de nouveau départ était le lieu idéal pour discuter de nos priorités politiques avec le gouvernement et le parlement portugais. Une fois encore, cher António, merci beaucoup pour votre hospitalité. Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, c’est dans les périodes de grand bouleversement que notre tissu social est le plus mis à l’épreuve. Nous le constatons en Europe et dans le reste du monde, les évolutions démographiques, sociétales et technologiques sont allées plus vite que notre capacité à répondre aux attentes des gens. Pour trop de gens, c’est une source de frustration et de division. Mais leurs attentes n’ont pas changé. Their expectations have not changed. They want jobs for a decent living, they want fairness, equality and social protection in times of need. They want to know that if they work hard and do their fair share they will not lose out. These are the unwritten rules and norms that make up our social market economy.  But while expectations have not changed, society and economy have, and our current rules are based on old realities. They do not entirely reflect any more the speed and the scale of transformations we are embarking on. So, as we overcome the pandemic, as we prepare necessary reforms, and as we speed up the twin green and digital transitions, I believe it is time to also adapt the social rule book. A rule book which ensures solidarity between the generations, a rule book that rewards the entrepreneurs who take care of their employees, which focuses on jobs and opens up opportunities, which puts skills, innovation and social protection on an equal footing. The good news is that with Next Generation EU we have all chosen to recover from this crisis together, rather than scrap for ourselves and widen social disparities.  With our SURE programme we have shown our commitment to protect jobs and workers. This has helped provide EUR 90 billion to support employees and employers in 18 Member States of the European Union, but there’s much more to do. This is why we will update our industrial strategy to make sure we can create quality jobs in the post-pandemic world, because the green digital and fair recovery must be a jobs recovery.  In the next month we will address some of the underlying societal trends. In March, indeed, we will bring forward our action plan on the European pillar of social rights, and I’m looking forward to the social summit in Porto in May where we can send a united message, along with social partners, with trade unions, with employer unions and the EU institutions. I want to thank you, António, for your leadership on this.  Honourable Members, as we all know, any recovery depends on overcoming the pandemic. I will not repeat what you already heard yesterday in your debate on the vaccine strategy, but I want to say this. Staying united at 27 on vaccines was the best choice. It was Europe at its best. And if anyone has any doubts, I simply urge you to look at the list of the top 50 countries in the world who have vaccinated the highest percentage of their population. All 27 Member States are on that list. Without a common EU approach, how many Member States would have been on that list? Without a common EU approach how many Member States would not have been able to negotiate a single contract? What would it have meant for our Union if one Member State had vaccinated almost all of its citizens before others have even started. But by working together the Commission was able to secure the broadest portfolio of vaccines in the world. As you know, this gives us access to 2.3 billion doses and this is more than enough for Europe, and our neighbourhood.  And a word on our neighbourhood. We need to support them to start vaccinating their front-line workers, from the Western Balkans to the Eastern Partnership, to our African partners in the south. This is why the Commission is proposing an EU vaccine-sharing mechanism. This will channel vaccines either directly or through the COVAX Facility, in which the EU is the largest contributor, to low and middle-income countries. In total, Team Europe has already provided almost EUR 40 billion of support to our partners since last April, and we need to show the same leadership when it comes to vaccines.  I know some will ask how we can talk about sharing vaccines with others when we are not all vaccinated ourselves. To them I say: this is not only a matter of solidarity, but also a matter of self-interest. We will only come out of this pandemic together. This is true for our health. This is true for our economies. This is true for our supply chains, and this is also true for our geopolitical credibility and influence. Those who show support to their partners with doses and deeds will not be forgotten. But those who do not will be remembered, but for very different reasons, and I am determined that Europe must be on the right side of history and humanity and I know this House feels the same way too. Honourable members,  Es ist ein Wettlauf gegen die Zeit. Wir sind mit beispielloser Geschwindigkeit vorangekommen. Was wir in zehn Monaten bei der Impfstoffentwicklung geschafft haben, braucht in der Regel zehn Jahre. Selbstverständlich haben alle Staaten weltweit auf der Strecke mit Schwierigkeiten zu kämpfen – sei es bei der Produktion, beim Vertrieb, bei der Logistik. Aber das werden wir überwinden, und wir werden das rasch tun. Aber auch hier gilt, dass es nur gelingt, wenn wir gemeinsam handeln. Ich werde morgen auf der Videokonferenz mit den Staats- und Regierungschefs Kernpunkte ansprechen: Wir müssen schneller werden beim Impfen. Das Tempo in Europa ist noch viel zu unterschiedlich. Wir müssen die Unternehmen mehr dabei unterstützen, die Produktionskapazität zu erhöhen, und das können wir auch, und das ist schon auf dem Weg. Und wir müssen die Ausbreitung der neuen Varianten des Virus präzise verfolgen. The spread of these variants is a cause for severe concern. This is indeed a race against time. The EU urgently needs to speed up genome sequencing. Currently only one Member State is testing above 1% of positive tests, and many have not even yet started. This makes it very difficult to identify the progress of the variants or to detect potential new ones. We should aim for every Member State to scale up sequencing to 5% to 10% of the positive tests. And I know not every country has the capacity to do so, but our agency, ECDC, does and every Member State has access to that capacity, but only two so far have used it. My last point is about preserving our single market. The message is clear. The blanket closure of borders in this situation makes no sense. They harm the functioning of the single market and they are not as effective as targeted measures, and this is why we need a common approach to test, trace, travel and borders, and the Commission has put everything on the table to ensure that we can do that.  Honourable Members, all of this will take continued efforts from us all and I’m delighted that we will have the Portuguese Presidency alongside us to make it happen. Together we will overcome the pandemic and, as the Portuguese Presidency so aptly says in its motto, it’s time to deliver.

It is good to have you here in the European Parliament.  The Portuguese people know how important a united Europe is. The Portuguese people know and believe that to be a European is not losing anything but winning a lot. Having the history of Portugal in mind, I think it's obvious that you are looking beyond the horizon, you are looking for new things, and you are not afraid of the unknown. This spirit is exactly what Europe needs now, the spirit of an explorer. So welcome, it's good to have you here.  I would, of course, like to start by referring to the issue of COVID, because we will continue to be concerned about all this in the next six months under the Portuguese Presidency. Historical crisis, and in the start of 2021, we show that we are better than we were in 2020 at the beginning of the crisis. On the part of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to fully support the approach of Ursula von der Leyen. We do not want first and second class Europeans on this continent. We are all the same and had the chance to access the vaccine at the same time. If there is now criticism of the European Union: last week, in a conversation with the CEO of BioNTech, I was able to experience and learn that BioNTech received EU funding 15 years ago. Without this EU money, BioNTech's research successes would not exist. We Europeans have made it possible for us to give an answer so quickly. We should be proud of that. Now it is necessary to overcome the supply bottlenecks, to really vaccinate the vaccination cans provided, that the authorities on the ground implement this. We need proof of vaccination for the European Union that there is no fragmentation in proof of vaccination, and we should be proud of what has been achieved. This should motivate us to show the same ambitions in the fight against Alzheimer's and cancer, to move forward as quickly as we did at Corona. The second thing that concerns us, of course, is economic development. The People's Republic of China had 2% economic growth last year – an increase of 2% – and we Europeans almost 8% were down. The weights in this world are being fundamentally redistributed, and that is why 2021 must be a year when we talk about jobs, jobs, jobs, about economic issues. We support the priority of a social Europe, and the most important thing in a social Europe is that our people have jobs, that the young generation in particular has jobs. A new lost generation must be avoided at all costs. That is the idea of a social market economy, and in this context, Prime Minister, I would like to emphasise that trade is important for Europe. As Portuguese Prime Minister, you know the importance of contacts with our South American friends: there is an agreement on the table with Mercosur, and we now need a Portuguese Government that shows us the momentum that these agreements are right and important. Last but not least, 2020 is the year of the crisis, and 2021 is hopefully the year of departure, and that is why I hope that you can start with the conference on the future of Europe, that you will get off to a good start. The time for crisis management should be over, we should now talk about the future of Europe, and the Lisbon Treaty shows that we are currently working on Portuguese roots. If Portugal now opens the new chapter, it would be a great signal.

We go through exceptional circumstances with a pandemic that has altered our lives and caused devastating consequences at the global economic level. In these months we have seen how the European Union has reacted to coordinate national responses and avoid harmful competition between us. We have managed to approve an ambitious budget and a recovery plan. The question now is whether all citizens will also notice this shared effort we have made.  The Union is an area of prosperity and social protection, and we are proud of our model, but let us be honest: it is not the same for everyone. And, in recent years, the gap between higher and lower wages has grown. Not to mention unemployment, especially young people, energy poverty or the lack of decent housing. The pandemic has exacerbated these inequalities and puts us in front of the mirror as Europeans. Why does the Recovery Fund set a minimum of 37% for green investments or 20% for digital transition and does not refer to a threshold for social spending and health systems? The Portuguese Presidency wants to address this deficit and, therefore, it is crucial to seize the window of opportunity. The COVID crisis makes clear the need to act and we have the experience of António Costa to ensure the right leadership for this historic moment. The Presidency's motto could not be more accurate: \"Time to act: for a fair, ecological and digital recovery\". Without a doubt, it is time to accelerate our transition to a more sustainable model by leveraging new technologies. But let's not forget that recovery, first and foremos say, has to be fair. The money we are going to invest should help narrow the gaps. More than that, the time has come to reform economic governance so that the social pillar is just as important as economic growth, and in that we have much to learn from a country like Portugal. We should suspend fiscal rules until 2023 and use this time to reform them, introducing, for example, the golden rule for social investment.  One of the key moments will be the Porto Social Summit in May. There we must put forward an action plan with clear strategy, with measures and with timetable, and they have the cooperation of my political group. We are concerned about the lack of progress on issues such as child guarantee or unemployment insurance, two proposals to which the European Commission committed itself. We ask the Portuguese Presidency to include, in addition, in its priorities the creation of a European health response mechanism in order to advance the Health Union.  This social dimension will also be reflected – I am sure – in a special commitment to introduce the gender dimension into all policies, and also the fight against all kinds of discrimination. And let us not forget an important issue: the new Pact on Migration and Asylum, which needs a mechanism to realize the principle of solidarity and ensure that our migration policy lives up to our values, remains pending. Finally, I hope that the Portuguese Presidency will be able to unlock the start of the Conference on the Future of Europe. We have to act with responsibility and unlock this situation. Let us not deceive ourselves: the important thing about this Conference is not the familiar faces, but the voices of millions of European citizens who want to lead us on the path of Europe to be built.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 80, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Dacian CIOLOŞ", "mepid": "197631", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President, Madam President, Prime Minister, welcome and good luck for your presidency. Your success will also be ours, you have all the beginnings to succeed and I know that Portugal, given its history and geographical position, knows very well what the added value of the European Union is and knows how to add value to the European project. The work we have done in recent months is enormous. Europe has made progress under the pressure of this pandemic, it is true, progress that many thought impossible until a year ago. But we are only at the beginning. You take, Prime Minister, the rotating presidency of the Council at a time when we need to transform the test: we must make 2021 the year of rebirth and for that, there is no miracle, we must overcome the pandemic and for this every European must have quick access to a safe and effective vaccine. Congratulations to the President for what the Commission has achieved, but you know that we are still counting on you to coordinate the vaccination campaign. But we also need to take care of our economic and social fabric, I know that is your priority. The historic recovery plan on which we have agreed must be put in place as soon as possible and we must be prepared to do more if necessary. The recovery must be green, digital, fair and forward-looking. It will therefore be our common responsibility to ensure that each government implements the strategic reforms and investments necessary for European money to contribute to the development of a new post-COVID world. Governments should not use European money to infuse without ensuring long-term and structural positive effects.  We must therefore rebuild, innovate and transform, building on the Green Pact and its variations such as the circular economy or the mechanism of carbon inclusion at borders. But also by relying on the digital agenda. As you know, there is an urgent need to take back control of our destiny in this area, it is an economic and social issue and the European Commission has put an ambitious project on the table.  But this rebirth will only really see the light of day if the rule of law is respected from day one. What is the point of investing if we are not even able to guarantee that these funds will not be misappropriated. This is an existential question for the Union. It is about preserving our values, but it is also a question of efficiency.  Beyond that, our Union should build a common asylum and migration policy: a major issue for the coming months, as well as that of our relations with our eastern and Mediterranean neighbourhood and the Western Balkans. I know that our neighbourhood expects a clear vision of the European Union on these projects. Prime Minister, nothing is pre-defined or pre-written. Even though we are still in the middle of a storm, I am convinced that Europe must raise its sails ever higher and maintain its course or risk drifting away. The contours of the post-COVID world depend entirely on our commitment, perseverance and the demands of our ambition. More than ever we are today the authors of our own destiny and this fate will be even better defined if we can unlock this conference on the future of Europe and I am convinced that with the Portuguese Presidency, in collaboration with Parliament, this will be possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 81, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Marco ZANNI", "mepid": "124780", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like to welcome Mr Costa to the European Parliament. We have just finished six months of the German Presidency, which have been painted as the success of a European vision on the multiannual financial framework, the Recovery Fund and the rule of law, with Angela Merkel appearing to have pursued brussels' interests, rather than her own interests.  But then we found that the reality in practice was quite different, and while we were committed in words to having a European dimension to crisis management, above all, some states were doing their own thing and negotiating bilaterally to have additional doses of vaccines. Let me make it quite clear that I do not want to attack these states for this legitimate choice, but simply to point out that, in practice, the national interest ultimately comes before the European interest. With you, Mr Costa, I would also like to reflect on what has been the European Union's response to the crisis, now that we have more or less all the cards on the table. The first point I would like to make with you is the fact that the only non-political institution of the European Union is the one that has really acted quickly and effectively, the European Central Bank, and this clearly raises a subject of democratic accountability, which cannot be ignored. Then I would like to turn to the pillar of this answer, which is the Recovery Plan, the European response to the crisis, to make some reflections with you and ask you a few questions. The first point concerns clarity, now that we have the cards on the table, on what the Recovery Plan is: we have discovered that it is European debt, so it is a debt that the European Union will assume on its shoulders; we have discovered that the first money will probably come more than a year after the outbreak of the crisis; we have discovered that, in order to repay this debt, the citizens of Europe will have to bear European taxes and we have discovered that there are conditions, conditions that, in my opinion, run both with what is the Costa Presidency's programme and with what is the vision, for example on certain rules, which the European Parliament has expressed across the board – as my colleague from the Socialist Group said.  The Stability and Growth Pact needs to be reviewed, it is old, it is no longer relevant and I believe that you, Mr Costa, can agree with this, and so I would like to ask ourselves whether we, on the one hand, say that this pact needs to be changed and that the Commission has undertaken to review it and, on the other hand, in the Regulation on the Recovery Fund we write in stone that , in exchange for that money, we must respect the Stability and Growth Pact, binding ourselves to these rules that we must change for the next fifteen or twenty years. I would therefore also like to understand how these conditionalities are combined with the programme of the Portuguese Presidency and, above all, what you mean by social pillar. I would like to end by giving you a good luck, because the next six months will be very difficult and you will have to implement this, which is a response, albeit belatedly, to the current crisis. I believe that we need the courage to change, the courage to look back, the courage to understand that the approach we have used is completely wrong, the courage to deny even those wrong choices. I believe that without a revolution of common sense and common sense, Europe will not be able to emerge from this crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 82, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, Prime Minister, welcome to the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen, on the environmental, social and economic level, I would even say geopolitically, Portugal's priorities for its Presidency of the Council are part of the general dynamics of the von der Leyen Commission, which has placed a green pact for Europe at the heart of its programme.  So, on the face of it, we would like to follow you with our eyes closed, but, as the saying goes, the devil hides in the details. And there is one - and it is a great size, Prime Minister - that totally contradicts the beautiful ambitions displayed. I am talking about your stubborn desire to ratify at all costs this relic of the 20th century that is the draft free trade treaty between the European Union and Mercosur. An obstinacy that you share with your Spanish colleague Pedro Sanchez, a socialist just like you.  And now we're not following you, but then not there at all! This project, if ratified, would be a disaster for climate and biodiversity because it will increase deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. It would be a disaster for our farmers, who are already burdened by an endless race for productivity and facing new unfair competition tomorrow, at a time when suicides are already decimating the agricultural world. It would be a disaster for the workers there, who would suffer massive job losses in the industrial sector, but also for the environmentalists, who today already pay with their lives to defend this common good that is the Amazon.  Finally, it would be a health disaster, firstly because our plates will be further invaded by pesticide-laden food products, most of which are banned in Europe, but also because massive deforestation coupled with intensive animal breeding promotes the transmission of diseases, such as COVID-19, to humans. All for what? Growth, you might say. Let's talk about it: 0.1 percentage points more GDP for the European Union and the same less for Mercosur. No, the real goal is to further increase the profit margins of multinationals by putting ever more pressure on the planet and the living, including humans. And this, at a time when our planet and our societies undermined by inequality are already on the verge of rupture. Prime Minister, this treaty is neither done nor done. And it is not by accosting him a little statement here or a protocol there that he would become virtuous. Mr Prime Minister, you may put lipstick on a pig, it remains a pig. For too long, the majority of European socialists, in the name of growth and employment, have swallowed up the myth that what is good for multinationals and for those they enrich is good for our societies. I'm telling you, wake up! Prime Minister, if you take seriously the principle that none of our policies can make the environmental and social situation of the planet worse, this famous 'do no harm principle', you must relegate the treaty with Mercosur, at least as now negotiated, to the dustbin of history. In contrast to the levelling down it has produced so far, it is time to make our trade policy the central instrument of a virtuous emulation in favour of ever-higher social, environmental, health, fiscal and even democratic standards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 83, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Peter LUNDGREN", "mepid": "124996", "text": "  On the other: The ECR Group. Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr Welcome here, Prime Minister Costa. Believe me, you have to do. There's work to get your teeth into.  I would like to highlight three points. EU recovery fund. What do you really mean by the Solidarity Fund? For example, Italy receives 9 billion for health care, 17 billion for gender equality and the vast majority, 75 billion, goes to climate change. What does this have to do with Corona? After the United States and Germany, Italy has the largest gold reserve. Maybe you could have used just a little bit of that reserve? Why should Swedish taxpayers be involved in funding this? To spend EUR 75 billion from the Corona Fund for climate change change in Italy – is it solidarity with the Swedish taxpayers? You can call it whatever you want: Coronafund, nextgeneration fund. I call it that Sweden is an ATM for Southern Europe.  Next thing I want to take up vaccination sessions and I hope you will make an effort there. Will free travel in the future only be possible for the holders of one? So we're going to divide people into categories now? This is a frightening example of how the corona crisis is being exploited to create a federal state.  Finally – freedom of speech. I see nothing in portugal's programme on this. Big Tech companies are the new powers. They are the ones who decide who can speak. It is the law that limits what is illegal or not to express on social media, not the political preferences or discretion of platform owners.

Mr President, Prime Minister Costa, welcome here to the European Parliament. 13,000 job cuts at Airbus, 10,000 at IBM, 2,300 at Michelin, 2,000 at Sodexho. I could continue to list this sordid list of social plans for hours, as the social crisis is raging all over Europe. Companies that lay off, self-employed people strangled by debts, unemployment exploding: this is the terrible situation in Europe at the beginning of the year. That must be the top priority of your presidency. The recession has a good back for crisis profiteers who receive public aid without any social consideration. So yes, to distribute dividends to their shareholders, some of the multinationals did not hesitate for a moment, but when it comes to saving jobs, there is no one left. Take, for example, Sanofi, four billion euros in dividends and 1,700 jobs cut. Behind these figures that give the whirlwind, these are so many lives turned upside down, worried faces, disoriented families who sink into poverty, sink even deeper into precariousness. In Italy, 3.7 million people have used food aid, in France it is an increase 30%, in Barcelona the meals distributed have increased 20-fold. Colleagues, in one of the richest areas in the world, people are hungry. Misery affects all segments of our society and it is even more powerfully affecting young people. Already ignored, they find themselves completely abandoned with this crisis. In France, 50% of students have difficulty eating properly, a quarter have had suicidal thoughts, when they do not already act, like these two students in Lyon. An entire generation is sacrificed and calling for help, but our governments refuse to listen to it.  So the Portuguese Presidency said it would make the social crisis its priority. On behalf of our Group of the Left in the European Parliament, I would like to make you a simple but meaningful proposal, which is fraught with meaning. Let us declare a social state of emergency. Our Parliament recently proclaimed a climate emergency in the face of the destruction of our planet.

Do you have any plans to coordinate government responses to restriction measures? If at Christmas one had opted for coordination and if he had followed the French, German and Italian examples, the numbers in Portugal would not be so tragic.

As for the Recovery Fund, what will you do to ensure that the money is well spent?

It is in the House of European democracy of which you have been a member.

As Portuguese and as a European I am proud of the lucidity and courage with which the Portuguese Presidency has defined and is putting its priorities into practice. A pragmatic definition, because when people are suffering, as so many are suffering from the health, economic and social impacts of the pandemic, pragmatism is the first of the principles.   The answer to the needs of citizens is a humanistic duty and the antidote to populism. And we know, even from experience in Portugal's internal politics, that there are those who do not hesitate to propagate false narratives to weaken the ability to comply. And that is what Mr Rangel did in his speech.    In this afternoon's debate everything will be clarified again about the appointment of the European Prosecutor by Portugal and I hope that you will then have the humility to apologise. But we will. We will be able to take full advantage of the union's new cycle of solidarity cooperation, implementing the common vaccination strategy, advancing the progressive rooting of a health union, deepening the social dimension of the energy tradition and digital achievement and, at the Porto Social Summit, making room for new concrete measures on inequalities, new precariousness and dignity. We'll go further.  Today, a new cycle in global geopolitics begins with the inauguration of the new American Administration. It is the time for a new multilateralism with more strategic autonomy. The Summit with India, the digital tie-up to South America, the special attention to relations with Africa, the new cycle of transatlantic relations mark the first steps of the European Union in this new cycle. Prime Minister, the connection of the EllaLink submarine cable to Sines, from South America to Sines, is, moreover, a sign of the clear perception that no strategy to combat climate change or inclusive digitisation will be successful if it is only European.

Renew Europe shares the ambitions of the Portuguese Presidency to deliver on key issues, such as the green and digital transition, a strong recovery of the European economy, strengthening the role of the EU in a turbulent world, and making headway with the Conference on the Future of Europe. We also underline the priority to make progress on the new agreement on migration and asylum. Europe needs a comprehensive migration policy that looks internally at the challenges we face, but crucially, also with an external focus. We need to have good solid partnerships with countries of origin and transit to address and tackle our illegal and, above all, dangerous routes of migration to the European Union. How is this Presidency going to keep pressure on this process? With the digital transition moving forward, we must not forget to respect and defend the fundamental rights of users, the protection of our democracy and ensure a level playing field for our businesses.

On the contrary, recent events in the United States should encourage us to fight against the grip of the GAFA and their desire to privatize civil liberties outright. On the implementation of the European recovery plan: while support for our devastated economies is obviously vital, I remain dubious about the recovery plan itself, which is ignored, including funding, and whose expenditure by the Member States will once again be subject to the close control of the European Commission. All pretexts are good for more Brussels centralisation, even though bureaucratic rigidity, lack of anticipation and lack of agility have characterized the European institutions throughout the health crisis.  With this recovery plan, my country, France will receive a total of 35 billion euros less than what it will pay even though we are one of the countries most affected. No doubt this is again a great victory for Emmanuel Macron on the European stage. The Portuguese Presidency also wants to deepen the single market. But what this market needs, before it deepens, is its protection! We must fight against unfair competition, we must re-industrialize in order to gain independence on the world stage. We need better food security for our nations and health for our peoples. We must increase controls and impose compliance on our standards on those who want to sell on European soil. The Mercosur agreement would be a real betrayal for our farmers, it would also be dangerous for our fellow citizens, it would finally be, and you know, disastrous for the environment.

The Netherlands receives very little, but it does guarantee 43 billion in case countries are unable to repay the money borrowed by the Commission. The Netherlands is therefore an ATM.

I regret that this debate will not be opened during the next semester and that our Presidency does not help to change economic governance rules that do not serve the European Union at all. I also think that a Presidency that gives so much prominence to the social issue, even announcing the proposal for the Social Summit, should also give a very important emphasis to labour issues in the context of social issues and this unfortunately does not happen and is unfortunately consistent with what has been the Portuguese Government's policy of not reversing the changes to the troika's time labour legislation.

Portugal is holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union for the fourth time, and whenever Portugal held the Presidency in the past, it was linked to important moments for the further development of the European Union. It was the Portuguese Presidency in 1992 when the Maastricht Treaty was signed, negotiated during the Dutch Presidency, signed during the Portuguese Presidency. The 2007 Treaty of Lisbon: negotiated, agreed, and signed under the Portuguese Presidency. It became fundamental law for all of us, for the European Union. And the Portuguese Presidency in the year 2000 marked decisive steps towards the accession to the European Union for some Member States in the south and in the east of the continent – Malta, Slovakia, Latvia, Lithuania, Bulgaria, and my home country, Romania. So Europe owes a lot to previous Portuguese Presidencies of the European Union, and the moment in time now is equally important. The Portuguese Presidency needs to lay the ground for the European Union of the future – more innovative, based on research, digital, based on a process of greening which works for the economy, works for people and works for enterprise. In December we managed to make important decisions: we agreed on the budget of the European Union for the next seven years, and we agreed on the biggest economy rescue package that the European Union has ever done. Now, Prime Minister Costa, it’s time that we make this work. Money needs to arrive to people in need, to enterprises in need, to regions, very soon. In two weeks’ time will take here in the plenary of Parliament the final vote for the Recovery and Resilience Facility, and I’m calling upon you, Prime Minister, to work with the Member States to also do the last steps at national level, specifically ratifying the own-resources decision so that we give the European Commission the permission to go to the market, to borrow the money so that it can reach the people in need very soon.

The Visegrad countries cannot accept this.

The protection of national minorities is part of the rule of law. If he does not wish to address this, all jourová's arguments against the rule of law will be discredited.

In today's health and economic crisis, real forward-looking decisions must be made, as the global race for a more successful recovery from the crisis has been going on for some time. A speedy recovery for Europe is a vital objective and our competitiveness depends very much on the decisions that must be made here and now. I am convinced that it is these actions that will increase Europe's beggars, support a wider digital and technological turn, and that it will give us the opportunity to stand at the forefront of global competition.  But, Mr Prime Minister, competitiveness also means the ability to provide our people with healthy and reasonably priced food produced in Europe. This is the main objective of the common agricultural policy. I very much hope that, in the trilogy of the common agricultural policy, Portugal will not be charged with the motivation to continue to operate in its field under the auspices of the green revolution. The role of the European Commission, and in particular Vice-President Timmermans, in the trilogy, has been not balancing and solution-oriented, but ideological and agriculturally worrying.

As Mr Azmani, Ms Bonafè, Ms Jongerius, but also our parliamentary leaders Mr Weber, Mr Cioloş and Ms García Pérez said, they all expressed in their interventions also the reference to hope – to hope that we will be able to come back to life as we knew it before COVID—19. I think it was also very clear from this debate what we need for that. We need to show the highest respect for EU solidarity and for EU unity. As you know very well, yesterday the Commission called upon the Member States to get more than 80% of the health workers and more than 80% of elderly over 80 years of age vaccinated by February. We would like to get 70% of the European population vaccinated by the summer. That’s the timeline, that’s the ambition, and that’s the hope, which we hope the European leaders will endorse tomorrow in a videoconference on this very issue. We believe that this is the best path to restore growth, prosperity and to bring us back to the normal joys of life we all miss so much. Honourable Members, in almost all interventions there was clear reference to the importance of tackling the social consequences and social problems aggravated by the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, we in the Commission appreciate so much the support of this House for the Portuguese Presidency’s ambition to complete the work on national recovery plans, to get approval for their own-resources decision, so that we can start the disbursement of money to kick-start our economies also by this summer. The European social summit organised and proposed by the Portuguese Presidency will be an excellent opportunity to put in practice all the Commission’s measures we will prepare under the European pillar of social rights to make sure that nobody is left behind. Dear Prime Minister, honourable Members, the Presidency of Portugal is also opening a new chapter in pursuit of our European geopolitical ambition and the restoration of effective functioning multilateralism. It will be our efforts to help our neighbourhoods and to help the global effort in the vaccination. It will be closer cooperation with democracies, including the summit between the European Union and India, which happen to be the two largest democracies on this planet. And you heard also, Mr President-in-Office, the support of the Members of this House for open, strategic autonomy on which we will be working together. On top of it, it will be also under your Presidency when we will open a new chapter with the new incoming US Biden administration. We start to build a new relationship with the UK as a third country, and we will also push to rebalance the trade and investment relationship with China. Dear Prime Minister, you highlighted how important it is to listen to people and to respond to our citizens, and we all hope, as it was expressed by Mr Verhofstadt, Mr Weber and Mr Séjourné, that under your Presidency we will be able to launch a conference on the future of Europe and devote it to the debate and, I would underline, listening to our citizens – what they want us to improve and how they want us to shape our Europe in the future. And I agree with you that it should be the issues which are closest to their heart we should debate together. To conclude, I would like to assure you, Mr President-in-Office, that we will be working with you as closely as possible to make sure that, after your Presidency, Europe will indeed be healthier, greener, more digital and more socially fair.

In essence, it is the verification of a common objective of making Europe's economic and social recovery a priority. This recovery can't be just any recovery. It has to be a recovery focused on our future, on the strategic challenges that we face and, therefore, it must be based on what is the great ambition to make this decade a decade to achieve at least a 55% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and also to make this decade a digital decade. Nor can it be any social recovery and then, as Mrs Iratxe said, the social issue is absolutely central. This recovery has to be fair, it has to reduce inequalities, it has to create better jobs, decent jobs, jobs with rights. That is why we have placed the Social Summit as the great event of our Presidency, which is precisely to broaden a spirit of comprehensive social dialogue, which is the commitment that social partners, civil society, European institutions, Member States, we all have to celebrate so that we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we were when it began.  But this recovery process must also be demanding in respect of the values of the European Union and certainly a country that has experienced the longest dictatorship of the 20th century is particularly sensitive to the importance of guaranteeing the values set out in Article 2 of the Treaty and of not letting open proceedings in article 7 stop.  Those who violate the rule of law cannot be part of the European Union. Anyone who violates Europe's core values cannot be part of the European Union. That is why it is absolutely essential not only to ensure respect for the cross-compliance mechanism that this Parliament has adopted, but also to enforce and advance the processes that are open under Article 7.  Portugal is proud of the journey it has made since 1974 to be an exemplary country in the protection of the rule of law. I can really be proud that 20 years ago, as Minister of Justice, I witnessed the implementation and start-up of Eurojust and now it was also my Government that brought Portugal together with this enhanced cooperation mechanism, which is the European Public Prosecutor's Office, which is essential to combat corruption and ensure the smooth management of European money, since even my Government , Portugal had refused to join this enhanced cooperation mechanism. That is why we are taking over this Presidency of ours and that we are well aware that this Europe in today's global world really needs to have a stronger external presence. It has to truly be a global agent and we will not be a global agent or building walls to prevent migration, nor closing the doors to the trade relations that we have to open with all the other economies in the world. I understand the debate on Mercosur, but the Mercosur debate is not, first of all, an economic debate. Of course we all know that it is the most important trade agreement that Europe can conclude, but firstly, an agreement for Europe's geopolitics because, in this new global world, the Atlantic cannot lose its importance by letting the new centralisation of the world focus on the Indo-Pacific. We do not ignore this region and we have therefore given the summit with India a priority for our Presidency, but the Atlantic remains our space and that is why, although the United Kingdom has left, we have to have close relations with the United Kingdom. That's why we have to look with hope at this new relationship with President Biden. That is why we have to celebrate Ellalink, physically linking Europe to Latin America as an element of the utmost importance, but that is also why we need an agreement with Mercosur. We are awaiting the conclusions of the Commission's studies on the environmental impact of this agreement and on the steps to be taken, but there is one thing I would also like to say quite frankly, because it is quite frankly that we have to say: that no one wants to hide the methane produced by European cattle in the Amazon forest. No, we cannot want to hide in the Amazon forest what is really protectionism from an agricultural policy that has to be adjusted to the priorities of climate transition and environmental values. The environmental objective has be present in all European policies. I wanted to end by talking about the future and the future of Europe. We must unlock this small institutional impasse that has already caused us to waste x time to reflect on what europe's ambition to do together and there is no shortage of themes for Europe to discuss in its future: the issue of migration is a crucial issue, the post-COVID economic management of our Stability and Growth Pact is a central issue , relations with the African continent are a central issue, the issues of fiscal justice are a central issue.  That is why this conference must move forward and there is nothing to justify small institutional issues blocking what is the future of 450 million citizens. No, this conference really has to be about citizenship, about citizens, their longings, their fears and not on institutional issues.

Thousands of businesses have temporarily or permanently closed, millions of Europeans have lost their jobs and livelihoods, and almost all of us, in our own lives, have experienced a change to and, in some cases, have had to reshape our professional and private lives. All across Europe we have witnessed job losses, often with devastating effects for the people concerned, for their families and for the local communities. At the end of last year, almost 16 million people in the EU were unemployed, two million more than the year before. It is an appalling statistic, behind which there are countless people, countless stories, countless issues and the lives of people who were working and have now been pushed into poverty and precarity.  The COVID—19 pandemic has disproportionately affected the most vulnerable members of our society. It has laid bare existing systemic vulnerabilities and increased social inequalities to the detriment of those most disadvantaged. The pandemic has had a particularly strong impact on women. Our response to the continuing crisis and the recovery measures must therefore be designed in a gender—sensitive way. To this end, the Portuguese Presidency intends to table a set of Council conclusions on the impact of COVID—19 on gender equality in the labour market. The conclusions will form the basis of a forthcoming research note by the European Institute for Gender Equality.  Young people will also continue to disproportionately suffer the effects of this crisis. The reinforced Youth Guarantee, adopted by the Council in October, will help Member States better respond to the needs of young people and hence better target efficiency and monitoring.  We are now in the midst of a third wave of the virus, with even more contagious variants that have prompted stricter lockdowns in many Member States. Yet, at the same time, we are on the brink of hope that a vaccination can bring about the start of a long road to recovery. So the European social model that provided a cushion of support during this terrible period needs to be reinforced.  Although this crisis is grave, it would certainly have been far worse without the decisive action of the European Union and its Member States. At a time of difficulty, the EU showed unity, solidarity and flexibility, first addressing immediate emergency needs and then planning an ambitious recovery to make Europe more resilient, more competitive, just and sustainable for all future generations.  In the spring of 2020, we adopted the ESM Pandemic Crisis Support, the EIB Pan—European Guarantee Fund and SURE. While Member States fortunately did not need to activate their safety nets, thanks to the extremely favourable market financing conditions in 2020, EU workers benefited substantially from the support of SURE. All these measures were fundamental to support public action, enterprises and workers. We see that SURE has already been almost entirely utilised to support SMEs. We are also starting to see the benefits of the EIB support.  As for the recovery phase, we have come a long way since our leaders reached an agreement on the biggest ever MFF and on the unprecedented recovery instrument, the Next Generation EU, in July. These two instruments, amounting to more than EUR 1.8 trillion over the next seven years, are endowed with ambitious climate and digital targets and a focus on addressing challenges to employment, sustainability, resilience and competitiveness through reforms and investment. As such, they will enable the EU to provide both a much—needed cyclical stimulus and the right incentives to address structural issues in an ambitious way. While sharing the same objectives, the Council and Parliament had different views on how to structure this recovery plan. After intense, yet very constructive discussions and trilogues, we found political agreement on an ambitious text, which now needs to be swiftly voted on by the co—legislators, paving the way to the plan’s implementation. The Portuguese Presidency is indeed committed to steering the EU through a swift and efficient implementation of the instruments agreed in the course of the last year, ensuring a high degree of interinstitutional cooperation, flexibility and determination.  Addressing the social concerns of COVID—19 will be a key priority for our Presidency. We will seek to strengthen trust in the European social model, the importance of which became starkly clear during these troubling times. In this context, as you heard our Prime Minister say in this Chamber this morning, the Porto Social Summit that will take place in May will give impetus to the European social dimension and the European Pillar of Social Rights and its implementation plan, emphasising its central role in the European recovery and in adapting to the climate, digital and demographic transitions. We would like this summit to address the issues of employment. This morning, we were talking about jobs, jobs, and jobs. Indeed, we need to tackle this issue, and also skills, reskilling, innovation and social welfare to ensure that no one is left behind.  Resilience is part of the European identity, so to implement the European Pillar of Social Rights is the best vaccine against inequalities and fear. We have to tackle, and act quickly on all these fronts to fulfil the Portuguese Presidency motto: it’s time to deliver a fair, green and digital recovery. Thank you very much for your attention. I will remain here to answer your questions.

The Commission has indicated that our objective should be 70% of people vaccinated at the beginning of, or at least within, the next six or seven months. The second road to recovery is to maintain our strong will to contain the economic and social effects of the crisis thanks to the unprecedented efforts of the EU and the Member States.  As already described by the President, it is true that economic activity has been strongly impacted over the past year. And the outlook for 2021 remains uncertain because we do not know exactly what the evolution of the pandemic will be; thus the importance of vaccination.

But the statistics do not tell us the whole story, yet millions of people have lost already their jobs and they are mainly the low-skilled, the low-paid workers, the temporary workers, the young on precarious work, and the most vulnerable. Precisely the most vulnerable people have been disproportionately hit, and after a clear improvement, poverty and inequalities are again on the rise. Moreover, the recovery will likely be uneven across Member States, across regions, across economic sectors and categories of workers. Therefore, we need a strong solidarity at all levels – at national levels, at regional levels, and, obviously, also at European level.  The EU support is all the more important to ensure a sustainable and inclusive recovery and economic and social upward convergence. The EU has been reactive and played a leading role to mitigate the negative effects of the crisis. The EU launched an unprecedented plan for reform and investment worth almost EUR 1.8 trillion, made up of long-term investments, financed by the Multiannual Financial Framework, more than one trillion, and one other financial instrument, the Next Generation EU with EUR 750 billion. The Recovery and Resilience Facility will fund reforms, as the President has just mentioned, on the one hand, and investments in every Member States. We have to build back better, and here investments are extremely important. We have to support growth and employment while boosting the green and digital transitions. We are not talking about any growth: we want sustainable growth and we want an inclusive growth. Cohesion funds have been boosted through the REACT-EU initiative, increasing the resources of the current programmes to address the social and economic impact of the crisis. The European instrument for temporary support to mitigate unemployment risks in an emergency, better known as SURE, has helped and is still helping Member States fund their short-time work schemes and similar schemes for the self-employed to mitigate the immediate economic impacts of the pandemic and the necessary confinement measures. In addition, euro area Member States agreed to make available a combined volume of around EUR 240 billion to help finance health-care, cure and prevention costs due to COVID-19 through the European Stability Mechanism.  Yet a surge in unemployment may have only been delayed rather than averted. That’s what I meant when I said ‘statistics do not tell us the whole truth’. High risks affecting the labour market exist as many sectors are unlikely to fully recover for some time, and many companies are already experiencing financial distress. While short-time work schemes have been effective in cushioning the blow and continue to be an important element of support at this critical juncture of the pandemic, they cannot be a durable solution, although we have to maintain them where necessary and combined, if possible, also with training and with skilling people in order to offer them new jobs. We need to set the conditions for future sustainable economic growth and a quality job-rich recovery. Investments, reforms, active labour market policies and skills for jobs are key.  We need a coherent package of active labour-market measures to support structural change and quality job creation by easing business restructuring where needed and facilitating the redeployment of labour, notably towards the green and digital economy, and that’s what the President of the Commission, Ms von der Leyen, said this morning. Yes, jobs, jobs, jobs, is key, but we do not want precarious jobs, especially not for the young. We want quality jobs.  The modernisation of labour market institutions, promotion of upskilling and re-skilling and reinforcement of social protection and health systems will be crucial to strengthen economic and social resilience and secure growth and employment in Europe, also in the medium and long term. This is all the more important as we see that some groups are hit especially hard. We must avert at all costs the risk of a new ‘lost generation’. Years of progress in bringing down youth unemployment risk being compromised, in particular with a view to those furthest from the labour market. Therefore, it’s now important to implement the Youth Employment Support (YES) programme that the Commission launched in July already and to translate it in concrete actions and also to integrate it in the measures financed by the recovery and resilience plans. Workers in non-standard forms of employment, above all temporary employees, are particularly vulnerable. Women are over-represented in sectors that are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic. Women are also particularly affected by the increase in unpaid care and domestic work. Equality, therefore, remains high on our agenda, not just for pay, but also for all the opportunities in the economy and therefore will have also, especially in the care sector, where three quarters of workers are women. We have to value this work in terms of recognition but also financial recognition. Children in low-income families are also at risk, in particular as distance learning has become a norm for many pupils. It really matters whether you have access to a computer, a good internet connection, a quiet place to study, and parents who are able to support you. There is a new ground for inequality, for inequality of opportunities that we really have to tackle. In general, health, education and social-protection systems, in particular social services, have been put under unprecedented pressure, further exacerbating challenges for people in the most vulnerable situations. This will continue to stress test the capacity of social protection. And finally, this is part of the resilience we have to strengthen. We have to do that in relation to adequacy, coverage and sustainability. This has come to the fore in view of ensuring socially fair transitions. Our action plan to further implement the European pillar of social rights is imminent. It will turn the pillar’s principles into concrete action for recovery and renewed upwards convergence in the EU. This will include an update of the pillar’s social scoreboard in a long-term view up to 2030. Many measures, from boosting skills to reforms to strengthening social protection systems, to investments in social housing, for children in need can be supported through the new funding instruments established on the Next Generation EU and the MFF. The European Parliament and the Commission have been able to strengthen the social dimension of the Recovery and Resilience Facility even further, and I’m more than grateful for that work which has been done in Parliament. The Cohesion Policy, including the ESF+ and the Just Transition Fund, will also play a critical role in supporting economic recovery, and the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund for displaced workers can support workers who have lost their job due to restructuring.  This shows that we have formidable firepower, financially but also the tools, to turn the present challenges into opportunities. While building back our economies and societies, by boosting the green and digital transition, we need to set the conditions for achieving social progress. This is imperative for successful, fair, sustainable and inclusive recovery, and we will all meet in Porto to make these objectives very concrete.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 2, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 158, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Siegfried MUREŞAN", "mepid": "124802", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President, the pandemic and fear of job loss are, without doubt, the two biggest concerns of citizens throughout Europe right now. All of our political decisions have to keep this in mind. We should do all we can to reduce the risks of the pandemic and the negative effects upon the people, upon the companies of Europe and upon the regions, and we have to do all we can to support the process of job creation. Unemployment is still projected to rise this year; we do not know exactly how much it will increase, because we will only know the magnitude of the economic crisis after COVID-19, after the lockdowns and once the economy returns to its full potential of activity. We therefore have to do two things for the time being: firstly, implement the decisions that we have taken; and secondly, stand ready to do more if needed. In terms of decisions taken – and the Commissioner and Minister rightly outlined many of these – I would like to highlight the recovery and resilience facility. Here at the European Parliament, with myself, Dragoș Pîslaru and Eider Gardiazabal Rubial as co-rapporteurs, we worked hard to ensure it was better suited to supporting the process of job creation, SMEs and the people affected by the crisis.  So what have we done? Firstly, we have created a special pillar, a social pillar, to help those affected by the pandemic, particularly women, because, Commissioner, you’re right, very often the burden upon them was bigger. Then there is an economic pillar – support for SMEs – and we also make very clear that solvency instalments are allowed at national level, so countries can use the money to support companies facing the risk of insolvency. To conclude: to the Member States, please present your national programmes to the Commission as soon as possible. To the Commission, please adopt them as soon as possible so that money can start flowing, so that we can start helping those affected.

The finding is damning: with the crisis, the old continent is expected to have more than 30 million working poor, according to the European Social Observatory. I am thinking in particular of young people and women, who are most exposed to the economic and social consequences of the pandemic. Unfortunately, Europe's inability to overcome social crises is not a new fact.  However, in the mid-2000s, European Europe gave the impression that it was going to modernise its social policy agenda. In March 2008, the importance of the social dimension of the European Union was even an integral part of the Lisbon Strategy. However, in the following years, major concerns were focused on controlling public spending and structural reforms. Austerity became a key word in the public policy of the European Union and the social dimension virtually disappeared from the European political agenda.  Moreover, despite this observation, it is interesting to note that Brussels wants to strengthen the social dimension of economic and monetary union, while social and employment policies are very much within the competence of the Member States. This new federalist integration will run up against the reality of the multiple indicators reflecting European disparities on social issues.  Of course, Brussels has learned from its mistakes in previous crises, by creating the SURE programme to help workers keep their jobs, however, how will it be possible to effectively combine economic ambition with social and environmental ambition? Europe will finally have to clarify its priorities.

Women employed as the country's nurses are subjecting themselves and their families to illness every day. At the same time, it is one of the many women's professions that are underpaid and lack recognition. Indeed, the statistics show that we are far from both economic and social equality, and the health crisis has only exacerbated that.  We must ensure equal pay and we must close the pay gap!

We have waited, and it is a huge failure of the hard-working women in the health and care sector, for this proposal to be postponed again.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Secretary of State, we reached an agreement at the end of last year on the multiannual budget and the corona fund. However, that is not the end of the work. That's really just the beginning of the work. We must now ensure that these resources are injected into the economy as quickly as possible. This is therefore a call on all Member States to ensure ratification as soon as possible.  The use of these resources should support the recovery, provide job creation and allow us to strengthen our health systems, but also – and this is often overlooked today – to keep the debt mountains that are now emerging and which are swelling every day manageable. This can only be done with economic growth. If we do not achieve that growth, we will have inflation and/or bankruptcies of sovereign states. Neither is an enticing evolution and will certainly put further pressure on the European house. So hopefully these funds will be well spent, that economic growth will come and what we've seen happen a little too much with the vaccines.  Vaccines offer the way out of corona pandemic and – let's admit it as politicians – the scientists have done more than their job. We have those vaccines available today, something that deserves credit. Nevertheless, the EU and the Member States have again failed to offer the added value that Europe really should offer. Crucial opportunities were missed. I find the choice of purchasing a portfolio of vaccines to be very defensible and legitimate, but it must also be scientifically based. Stories are now circulating in the German press as if Europe had ordered too late and too few vaccines for the sake of French interests. This creates the perception of political haggling, which is, of course, totally unacceptable in the present circumstances.  Even if there are sufficient vaccines available, there are apparently other problems. In Belgium today there is a shortage of syringes and hypodermic needles, yet another stock saga.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that we share a lot of elements in the analysis and I believe that there is a broad consensus on urgency and seriousness. What is important is to implement the measures now and I think we all need to be aware that this time it has to be different.  This morning, the president advocated what she called a new social rulebook. This underlines the importance of the social dimension in these policies. This is what the citizens are asking us, that Europe, that the European Union, like the Member States, like all the actors, be listening to them, or close to their problems, their difficulties.  And first and foremost, there is the stimulus, but the stimulus only works if it is implemented quickly. So I absolutely share what has been said, first of all about the presentation of the national plans and the rapid implementation of those plans. This also implies - and I agree with the calls that have been made by the President of Parliament and repeated here - that national parliaments and governments must do their job by ratifying the financial frameworks so that, in fact, the stimulus packages and in particular the related resources can be implemented. Yes, job creation is central. We are in a triple crisis. A health crisis that we hope to control thanks to vaccines, but also a fundamental transformation, which has been accelerated by this digital crisis. A revolution that affects many jobs, many companies, especially SMEs. And I agree that job creation must be at the heart of our concerns, especially through support for SMEs, new businesses, start-ups, those who invent the technologies of tomorrow.  But at the same time we must prepare all those who risk losing their jobs tomorrow to these new deadlines, to these new challenges and thus the investment in skills, in skills for both young people and also the less young is crucial. So I think what we have started with the various measures on training, of course we are not going to do it between now and Brussels, we are going to do it with the companies, with the social partners, with the regions, with the municipalities, wherever there is a transition to be made.  I have listened to what some colleagues have said about regions or rising unemployment.

We have the vision, we have the programmes and we have the budget. So we have the responsibility to succeed. And to succeed, we have to put the people at the centre of our policies. This is very clear. We need to work now to have an immediate impact on the lives of people with the national recovery plans and, at the same time, we need to push for reforms and economic and social investment that will have a long-term impact, addressing structural issues that became even more evident under the focus of the pandemic. Some of you said that the EU has already done a lot. This is true, and we should be happy about that, but we need to continue to do our utmost to help Member States protect Europeans from the social and economic consequences of this crisis. To this end, we need quickly to finalise the pending legislative work and move towards the implementation phase before the summer. We need to avoid delays. Recovery has to be anchored in sustainability, in innovation, in gender equality, and in upward social cohesion. We have to take care of the young and we also have to take care of the old, because we have seen the ravages that this crisis has taken on our older population too. Protecting Europeans from the adverse effects of the COVID—19 crisis will therefore remain high on our agenda. This trio of Presidencies – the current trio and the next trio of Presidencies – have already discussed this matter and will take this forward. So the Council is ready to continue working on these issues, together with the Parliament and the Commission. Thank you, Commissioner, for the proposals put forward. We look for the best solutions to meet this daunting challenge that we are all facing, and we need to face it together.

The COVID-19 pandemic has led to increased unemployment, increased social inequalities, deepening poverty among Europeans, collapse of health and education systems. Despite its limited competences in many of these areas, the European Union has already done a great deal to help Member States in their fight against the crisis. There has been a great deal of flexibility in the disburse of EU funds, the Commission has adopted a temporary State aid framework to support firms at risk, the SURE instrument to reduce the risks associated with unemployment has been implemented, and the FEAD instrument has been put in place to enable food or material assistance to those most in need. Finally, a new budget was adopted and EUR 750 billion was allocated to the Reconstruction Plan for Europe. However, this is only the beginning of our efforts. The true extent of the crisis will probably only come to an end once the pandemic has subsided. At this point, we must first of all focus on a rapid and thoughtful vaccination strategy that would give us a chance to return to normality. That is why I am pleased that we have used the mechanism of joint purchase of vaccines. Member States should also present recovery plans as soon as possible. Social dialogue with regions, social partners and entrepreneurs is important in this context. We must listen to the voice of the citizens. The proper use of resources must also be ensured.

The next step is, through national programmes and European programmes, to involve the whole of society in its implementation, putting people at the centre, focusing on requalification and preserving employment and ensuring that the energy and digital transition takes on a social dimension, ensuring that it will not be the poorest or the most vulnerable to bear its costs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 192, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Ewa KOPACZ", "mepid": "197525", "text": "  The next item is the report by Lucia Ďuriš Nicholsonova, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council amending Regulation (EU) No 223/2014 with regard to the introduction of specific crisis response measures with COVID-19 (COM(2020)0223 - C9-0151/2020 - 2020/0105(COD)) (A9-0174/2020).", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 193, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Lucia ĎURIŠ NICHOLSONOVÁ", "mepid": "197766", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Madam President. The current pandemic crisis has serious economic and social consequences for almost everyone. However, it has been paid the most, in all Member States, by people at risk of poverty. These people don't care if and when they go on an exotic vacation. These people are working out whether they can even afford to pay for hot food for themselves and their children or to warm up in the house. As a result of the pandemic, the rise in unemployment will be huge and the reduction in people's living standards will be extreme for millions of Europeans. But if living standards are falling for people who have already started from the poverty line, we need to act quickly to save them and we need to act effectively. And that's how I see FEAD, the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived. Help from it must be quick, it must be targeted, flexible and material. In my own country, Slovakia, after the first wave of the pandemic, the number of households freezing in winter has increased significantly, literally because they cannot pay for the heat. After the first wave of the pandemic, almost eight percent of households in Slovakia were in a situation where they could not pay their electricity bills. This is a huge increase compared to 2016, when it was 5 per cent of such households. Currently, 16 percent of families live in Slovakia, including families with young children who are trapped in poverty. Since the covid-19 outbreak, the situation has worsened for more than twenty per cent of European Union citizens at risk of poverty and social exclusion. The European Aid Fund for the Most Deprived is precisely the instrument that helps people in need on the way out of poverty and from social exclusion. Through the Fund, states can provide food and basic material assistance, but also immaterial aid to cover basic needs for those most in need. Since its inception in 2014, FEAD has assisted 13 million people a year, including four million children living in poverty in the European Union. The crisis has exacerbated social disparities and inequalities. Member States need to draw money from the European Aid Fund to help the most vulnerable. Of course, the crisis also has a negative impact on the ability of partner organisations to deliver aid to those who are dependent on it. Today, the staff of partner organisations must be protected themselves in order to be able to deliver material assistance where it is needed. That is why, as part of the revisions to the FEAD Regulation, we are taking exceptional measures that are a direct response to the deteriorating situation not only of those who are dependent on aid, but also of those who ensure that they receive aid. I would also like to thank the Commission very much; The revised regulation will allow Member States to also benefit from additional FEAD resources of up to 100 percent. It will be up to the Member States to decide how much additional resources are being made from REACT-EU to FEAD, and this will only be done according to how much resources one or another country will need to help the most vulnerable populations affected by the crisis, be they families affected by job losses, single mothers with dependent children, or elderly and sick citizens, or people living in separate and segregated communities. , such as Roma settlements. In doing so, they will have to stick to the principles of integration and non-discrimination and equality from a gender perspective, all in accordance with the Charter of Rights of the European Union. The good news for the Member States is that they can apply for 100% of European money, which means that aid from the Fund can be paid without restrictions, without delays and without burdening national budgets. I am really pleased that we have agreed on all these important elements, and I firmly believe that, thanks to this review, the aid that is so important now and in the current crisis will reach all vulnerable citizens who need it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 194, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Nicolas SCHMIT", "mepid": "197428", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, we just had a debate on the social and employment consequences of the crisis, and now we are discussing one of the most dramatic impacts of this crisis on real lives, which are under pressure, under threat – the lives of people who are suddenly in deep poverty. The social impact of this pandemic is primarily affecting precisely the most deprived, and demands for additional material and social support are rising, because some people – who never imagined they would find themselves in such a situation – from one day to the next have lost their jobs, they have lost their businesses, they have lost their income, and they are facing deep social problems, deep poverty. In many Member States, we see the queues at food banks and soup kitchens becoming longer and longer, and joining them are people who never thought their lives would go this way.  Thank you for the presentation and the introduction, and also for setting out the dramatic consequences. We have a duty to protect the most vulnerable during this crisis. That is why I thank you, Madam rapporteur and the Parliament, for having quickly concluded on the regulation amending the existing Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, or FEAD. I particularly thank Madam Nicholsonová, Chair of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, who has led the work on this file, and also the shadow rapporteurs.  As has already been said, with this amendment we are ensuring that we can mobilise fresh money for 2021 and 2022 for the most deprived people through the Fund for European Aid to the Most Deprived, as part of our overall EU crisis response. Our contacts in the Member States signal that these possible top—ups will be well used, and we estimate that they will inject substantial amounts of fresh money into the FEAD. It is our joint mission for the additional funding to swiftly reach the most deprived. So we will already pay 11% of the 2021 allocation as initial pre—financing.  The support for the most deprived is also part of the European Social Fund Plus proposal, which is still waiting for an interinstitutional agreement by the co-legislators. Progress was made under the German Presidency and I’m very hopeful that under the rapporteur and the Portuguese Presidency, we can come to a rapid conclusion. I also want to thank all those in the NGOs who, day after day, are committed to helping the people who are close to despair.

For the European Parliament, the defence of the EAFD is an absolute red line, including in the ongoing negotiations on the new European Social Fund Plus, which will include it internally. I would like to say this to my colleagues present from the new Portuguese Presidency: the EAFF today allows thousands of organisations across Europe to finance projects to combat poverty on the front line, which are essential to give dignity to people in need, thanks to accompanying measures, psychological support, training, administrative and legal assistance. It allows the financing of food stamps and vouchers for families and individuals in need. It allows the canteens of the poor to operate in continuity in their service. Today in all European countries, also due to COVID-19, the rows at these canteens are stretching frighteningly. That is why, thanks to REACT-EU, Europe is making an additional EUR 55 billion available for inclusion and social cohesion policies.

Indeed, this revision will make it possible to fight poverty more effectively by increasing the appropriations from the REACT-EU initiative and the pre-financing in support of actions on the ground. In France, one third of food aid is financed by European funds and the demand has unfortunately increased by about 30% with young people, the elderly, women who for the first time use this aid.

From Paris to Warsaw, Dublin to Athens, an increasing number of people in the EU are struggling to afford the rising cost of housing. Even before the start of the pandemic, one in ten Europeans were spending more than 40% of their income on housing. And not only the price, but also the quality of housing is a problem. Far too many people in Europe are living in overcrowded, damp, poorly-insulated, or otherwise unhealthy homes, with unaffordable utility bills. We can’t just be bystanders; this housing crisis is affecting people from all demographics: young people who are forced to stay with their families longer than they want because they can’t afford a place of their own; people who are thinking of starting a family but are postponing this since they still live in a studio, for which they can only just make the rent; elderly people who would like to move out of their family home but can’t afford to get an adjusted apartment, whilst young families are desperately waiting for a family home to move into. And this is the housing crisis for those that actually have a home, because the sad reality still is that more than 700 000 people sleep rough every night in Europe, and this number keeps on rising year after year in the last decade. This report recognises that access to decent and affordable housing is a fundamental right, a right that is guaranteed at EU level. This can’t just remain nice words, colleagues. And as a rapporteur on this topic in the European Parliament, it has become clear to me that the European rules today are often better at protecting the making of profit on the housing market than at protecting people who need a roof over their head. This has to change. We need the EU to step up its game and do its part with all the tools it has at its disposal to tackle the housing crisis, side by side with the Member States and local level that of are, of course, crucial. The report offers concrete solutions for the Commission, the Member States, and the local level to take action. And for this, I also want to thank the shadow rapporteurs, with whom I had a very pleasant collaboration. Because we can solve the housing crisis if we want to. We can end homelessness by 2030. Homelessness is an extreme form of poverty and a violation of human rights. In the coming six months, the Commission will propose its action plan on the European Pillar of Social Rights that addresses homelessness in its Principle 19. And the topic is high on the agenda of the Portuguese Presidency. The Commission should be bold and dare to propose a social moonshot strategy: an EU level goal together with all the Member States to end homelessness by 2030. Commissioner Schmit, I’m very happy that you’ve already shown your willingness to work on this, and the European Parliament with this report makes also a strong call to tackle homelessness once and for all. Let’s be partners and put the collaboration platform on homelessness that has been announced to work with a clear and ambitious target. We can also increase investments in affordable housing. Since the financial crisis, we have an average annual investment gap in affordable and social housing of EUR 57 billion per year. We need to urgently close this gap. We can, on the one hand, ensure that EU prioritise this investment for each budget and that Member States prioritise it in their recovery plans. On the other hand, the new fiscal rule book of the EU should allow for more public investment in housing. We can fight climate change, create jobs and tackle energy poverty through housing renovation. We are living through a health crisis; we have an economic and social crisis unfolding; there is a climate emergency. We can tackle all these issues by investing in quality housing through the renovation wave. We know that housing renovation can create two million jobs. This investment in renovation can help kickstart the economy. Bad indoor quality, damp housing, mouldiness – all have an important influence on respiratory diseases like Covid, so we can improve people’s health through renovation, and on top of that we can get millions of people out of energy poverty. We can stop illegal holiday rentals. In more and more cities, residents are pushed out of their neighbourhoods because it’s more profitable to rent apartments to tourists. Many cities feel powerless against these platforms when trying to get rid of illegal hotels. We can give cities more control over short-term holiday rentals through platforms like Airbnb. Through the Digital Services Act, we have to make sure that these platforms share the necessary data on rentals with cities so that rules on illegal holiday rentals can be enforced. We can make sure houses are to live in. Rather than a fundamental right to be guaranteed for all, housing has increasingly been considered only as a market to make profits through speculative acquisitions and through hedge funds and foreign institutional investors such as Blackstone, treating housing as a tradable asset. This has a dramatic effect on prices. We can do something about this by checking if the EU rules on real estate transactions and ownership, and put forward proposals to better protect mortgage borrowers from evictions. Citizens across Europe are struggling and count on us to stand by their side.

So it’s not just a national issue; it has become a real European issue. I also want to thank the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs for its timely and very relevant work on this report on access to housing.  Importantly, the report calls for an integrated approach to social, public and affordable housing at EU level. I very much share the objective of tackling homelessness and of supporting access to decent and affordable housing as a key factor in fighting poverty and social exclusion. We talk a lot about better wages, about minimum wages; this is extremely important. But even if I increase the minimum wage, if housing rents are increasing much more, people have not gained – they are not more prosperous; they have become even poorer. So I think the housing issue is a central issue in terms of social policy and improving the social context in all our Member States. Last year’s employment and social developments in Europe highlighted the strain that the increase in house prices over the last decade is putting on the middle class in the EU. There is a poverty trap looming because of this housing crisis for a lot of people who can no longer afford to find decent housing, and I would say housing close to their job, which, incidentally, creates other issues of transportation and CO2 emissions. Housing costs are higher in cities than in rural areas and represent a burden for more than one third of households living below the poverty threshold. In 2018, one person out of seven in the EU was living in a dwelling of poor quality. Thirty-Four million Europeans are struggling to keep their homes adequately warm in winter. And, more worryingly, homelessness trends have been on the rise over the last decade in most Member States. And I agree that we need better and more data to really understand what is happening here.  The COVID-19 crisis has worsened inequalities and people’s ability to cover housing-related expenses. The health crisis has underlined how essential a decent home is to health and well-being. It has demonstrated the vulnerability of persons, families, children, who experience homelessness and the pressing need to address this extreme form of social exclusion. As the honourable Members know, housing policies are obviously a national prerogative. But the EU has a key role to play in supporting its Member States, in helping Member States to exchange experiences – and indeed there are good and positive experiences all over Europe – on developing affordable housing, and also, in financially supporting the development of affordable housing. In the context of the COVID-19 recovery strategy, building renovation constitutes an opportunity to boost the green transition and, at the same time, employment. In particular, the renovation of social and affordable housing districts has the potential to reduce energy poverty, create local jobs and bring long—lasting benefits for communities. In this regard, local social economy enterprises can also play a key role by improving the accessibility and affordability of housing. The Commission encourages Member States to include building renovation in their recovery and resilience plans, with particular emphasis on social and affordable housing, and, in accordance with the principles introduced in the renovation wave, to establish long—term local public-private partnerships, supporting skills, digitalisation and smart technologies. Energy poverty is a strong focus of the renovation wave. The Commission has issued a recommendation to support national, regional and local efforts in tackling this issue. In addition, it will continue to support the EU Energy Poverty Observatory, which collects data, develops indicators and disseminates best practices for tackling energy poverty. The Commission will also support eradicating homelessness through Next Generation EU and the next long—term EU budget, namely under the European Social Fund Plus (ESF+) and the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF). In particular, the integrated housing——led approach will be supported by the ERDF in combination with ESF+. This approach follows the principles of Housing First, which combines immediate housing with enabling services to help previously homeless people pay their rent, promotes stable living conditions and prevents repeat homelessness. To tackle all these issues, and to help Member States – but also local authorities, municipalities and regions – address this problem of homelessness, together with the Portuguese Presidency we will organise a conference in June. It will be a broad conference bringing together all stakeholders – not only Member States, the Commission, Parliament and national parliaments, but also local authorities and NGOs – precisely to create a common platform to address the problem of housing and mainly the problem of homelessness.  There are good approaches in certain Member States and municipalities in our Union. We really have to help everybody to address this problem efficiently, with the aim of reducing drastically – if not absolutely – the question of homelessness. The future Invest-EU programme and its social and skills window will support investment in social housing and accompanying services for vulnerable groups. Homelessness and housing affordability and their social and macroeconomic implications are considered in the context of the European semester and included in the country—specific recommendations addressed to Member States. I’m looking ahead to the upcoming action plan implementing the European pillar of social rights, which will clearly emphasis this problem and we will discuss how to concretely translate principle 19 to the benefit of all those who suffer from bad housing or even the absence of housing.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 215, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Dennis RADTKE", "mepid": "188945", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all, iammy and thanks to the rapporteur and to the shadow rapporteurs for the work that has been presented here – an extremely important piece of work, but also, in some details, a somewhat difficult report.  So what we do not have to argue about with the PPE-DE is the fundamental question and also the fundamental passion and willingness to fight against homelessness and affordable housing, which is not something we need to argue about. But we need to talk about some details. That is why we have marked two key votes for us in this report. On the one hand, this is the question: a binding renovation rate. Yes, when it comes to energy-efficient building renovation, the greatest potential sit-downs when it comes to the issue of CO2 savings. But the objectives must also be realistic and also financially viable. The same is true of a ban on investment in real estate. Yes, there is a real conflict of objectives here too. But if you look at the structure of private pensions, you will find that real estate investments play a major role here. So that's why let's argue about these details, that has to be.

The housing crisis affects all Member States and affects all of us. People who have difficulty accessing decent housing are counted not by thousands, but by millions in the European Union. More and more people live in slums and informal settlements, in unsanitary living conditions.  The pandemic has only exacerbated this situation. Housing is a fundamental right and one of the basic pillars of the welfare state. It should be excluded from competition rules, just as social investment should be excluded from fiscal consolidation policies. We need to be brave and make important changes; bet once and for all on a universalist approach to housing.  The Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats has introduced in the report real ambitious proposals: the inclusion of housing in economic services of general interest, for the objective group to be expanded and that access to social housing also extends to the middle classes and not only to the most vulnerable; that the housing cost overload indicator reflects the reality of what families live and looks at no more than 25% of their disposable income; ensuring the provision of adequate and affordable housing for the three lower quintiles of society; and that 30% of new housing is affordable for middle- and low-income people.  Evictions and homelessness are a violation of human rights. The Housing First program must be strongly supported. Regulation of the rental market and the real estate sector is also necessary, addressing housing speculation, increasing taxes on largeholders of housing and the supply of rental housing, especially publicly owned, and regulating holiday platforms.  Finally, the wave of energy renewal has to start by rehabilitating the homes of the most disadvantaged groups, and it is up to regulators to ensure that electricity suppliers adopt protection schemes to ensure the supply of energy to the most...

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in fact, these three debates that you have organised today have one thing in common. What we have in common is how can we guarantee more social justice, how can we guarantee all European citizens, wherever they live, a number of fundamental rights without which we cannot organise our lives? This applies to the COVID crisis and its impact on employment, the same applies to those who have already been hit by this crisis, those who are in poverty and the same goes for those who are the victims of the housing crisis. There is a broad consensus on this right to housing. Housing is not just an economic sector, an object of speculation, it is a right. And since it is a right, then it must be implemented, it must be guaranteed to be implemented by everyone and I believe that this is what everywhere, in all Member States, we must make efforts. We do have to make sure that housing is accessible, affordable, that there is social housing.  It is also true that, in the context of renovation, which is central and can be a major asset, both social and economic, especially to get out of this crisis, there are also dangers, this has been noted in particular by some, and the danger is that you renovate and expel. In fact, you make these renovated dwellings unaffordable and that is what you should avoid because it is called gentrification. Neighbourhoods that offered housing to people at a certain level of rent suddenly become inaccessible once the housing is renovated. And there it is a danger, because it is increasing, it is exacerbating the housing crisis and it is also exacerbating social injustice.  When you look at the evolution of rents, particularly in many urban centres, and the evolution of wages, the range has completely opened. Therefore, we must act in a coordinated way, of course, every time in a national and local context on the issue of platforms that ultimately immobilize thousands, hundreds of thousands of dwellings.  The problem of unoccupied housing for reasons of land speculation must be brought under control, as investment in affordable housing must be controlled. Moreover, I have just seen the arrival of my colleague from the economy, housing is a social problem, but it is also an economic problem. A big economic problem. We know that sometimes the housing crisis takes a different form. It takes the form of bubbles with financial crises at the key, so I believe that there is a European dimension here that should not be ignored, that should not be ignored.

Digitalisation and digital tools have brought many new opportunities, both in our personal and also in our working lives. It has created benefits, it has created advantages for employees such as greater flexibility and less commuting times. But it has also its pitfalls, such as the constant pressure on workers to always be reachable, to always be available at all times. Digital tools used to work have created the phenomenon of always being connected: an always-on culture, creating digital obesity that can intensify work and extend working hours with a detrimental effect. A detrimental effect on workers’ fundamental rights. A detrimental effect on fair working conditions. A detrimental effect on fair remuneration, on working time and on work-life balance, on health and safety at work, on the equality between men and women. Digital tools make it particularly difficult to switch off in our free time. We all know the feeling of always being under constant pressure to check: to check for work-related emails, work-related messages, worried that our immediate attention is required. We all have been in situations where we receive work-related calls, emails, and we feel obligated to reply. More than ever, in the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, the increase of telework and working from home, we have been victims: victims of our phones, of our emails, of our computers. The COVID-19 pandemic has fundamentally changed the way we work, and we must therefore update our rules. During lockdown, one in three workers started working from home. This has saved countless lives, but many workers suffer and are suffering from harmful side-effects, such as isolation, fatigue, depression, burnout, muscular or eye illnesses. People who regularly work from home are twice as likely to work more than the maximum 48 hours. The boundaries between work and private life have become blurred. The human cost is high, from unpaid overtime to exhaustion, to burnout. It is fundamental that we protect workers from the invasion of their rest time and to ensure that their right to rest and leisure and a maximum limit of the workday are safeguarded. And for this, we need the right to disconnect to become a fundamental right, a fundamental right to each and every worker throughout our Union. Therefore colleagues, I strongly urge you to support this own-initiative report.   We are calling on the Commission to propose a European directive on the right to disconnect. The report is putting forward a fully-fledged, developed legislative proposal with the minimum requirements for using digital tools for professional purposes outside our working time. It provides for the right to disconnect for all workers in the EU, and it ensures that digital tools are used as an asset benefiting employers and workers while their adverse effects are mitigated. It provides workers with the right to disconnect, switch off and refrain from engaging in work-related tasks, activities or communication outside the working time. The report is also introducing safeguards to workers against any victimisation or negative repercussion if they use this right. Employers should enforce this right and not require workers to be directly or indirectly available or reachable outside their working time and provide them with sufficient information and methods to support the right to disconnect. The report also recognises the social partners’ pivotal role and tailors its implementation to the specific needs, depending on the different national and regional levels, sectors, and industries. Those are the main elements of the report, providing the right balance. The right balance equally positive for both workers and also employers, and I am counting on your support to show solidarity with European workers, especially during these difficult times of the pandemic. Please let us stay focused on the right to disconnect. The report will help millions of workers in these challenging situations. Nothing in it or in the amendment tabled by me intends to undermine the social partners, neither limit the Commission’s legislative power to propose legislation on the right to disconnect in early course. The report or the amendment in no way can change the Treaties or limit the Commission’s legislative power or veto the European legislation. Social partners in Europe are fully autonomous in what they negotiate. For me it is clear that we, as European Parliament, cannot interfere in this process, and the amendment should not be interpreted as making any legislative proposal contingent on the framework agreement, which, as stated in paragraph 13, addresses some arrangements for connecting and disconnecting and no other aspects of the right to disconnect. (Applause) I call therefore on the Commission, on the Commissioner for Jobs and Social Rights, Schmit, if the European report is adopted, to act immediately, through consultation with social partners, and put forward a proposal for legislation on the right to disconnect, because only through European legislation we can ensure the real impact on the very-much needed workers’ rights in the digital world. Colleagues, we have a fundamental choice to make tomorrow. We either provide workers with the right to disconnect or turn our backs on them. My choice is clear. I hope you can all support the right to disconnect for all European workers.

With the lockdowns due to the COVID-19 crisis, this gained much more prominence, and it will likely remain a permanent feature in the work organisation. Digitalisation has created, indeed, new businesses, new opportunities, new ways of working, living and consuming. It has led to productivity increases, to more flexibility for workers and businesses, and in the context of the pandemic, allowed many workers and many companies just to continue their activities. So if there is, on one hand, an important advance by the digitalisation of the European economy, we have also to have a very, very keen look at the upholding of working conditions and labour law. The new economy cannot develop outside the normal framework of labour law, including also working time. This is not just a social dimension; it’s also an economic one, so we have really to maintain a balance between the development of digitalisation on the one hand, with the extremely important tools we all have in our hands, and on the other hand, the rules, the framework, the laws which protect people, because we want a people-centred development of digitalisation. This report identifies some of the key challenges that new technologies pose, indeed, to the world of work. Addressing these challenges is all the more important in view of the effects of the COVID-19 crisis, because this has accelerated a lot of these processes. In Europe we can pride ourselves on a strong set of social and labour laws which already touch upon some of the challenges raised by this report. We have the Working Time Directive, the Occupational Safety and Health Framework Directive, the Work-life Balance Directive and the Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive, to mention the ones which are relevant for remote working and have a direct impact on the ability of the worker to disconnect from work obligations. These laws protect the well-being of European workers and put forward safeguards, amongst other things, against excessive working hours and unpredictable work schedules, including for the ICT-based work. We need to explore how best to seize the opportunities and address the challenges posed by digitalisation of the world of work, taking into account national industry and sectoral specificities, as the rapporteur has also mentioned. In this regard, the high-level conference on the future of work, remote work, challenges, risks and opportunities, planned by the Portuguese Presidency, comes very timely. Implementing a right to disconnect is often a matter of finding the right balance between the nature of the tasks, management style, personal choices and company-level rules. Certainly a one-size-fits-all approach is therefore not ideal, but this doesn’t diminish the importance of a right. Then you have to implement the right according to the different situations, and certainly this can be best done through social dialogue. As rightly set out in your report, social partners have a central role in dealing with issues linked to this right to disconnect. Social partners should take a leading role in this regard, and the Commission stands ready to assist, ready to encourage. But this means that we have to be all de bonne foi. In the last few years, some Member States have taken action by directly or indirectly mandating social partners to negotiate provisions on the right to disconnect. Italy, Spain, France, Belgium are among those countries. And in the past, social partners have already agreed on a cross-industry framework agreement on telework, in 2002 – so quite a long time ago, when telework was starting. Now telework is extending, and close to 30% and sometimes even more people are on telework. It would perhaps be important to have a look at this agreement and to adapt it to the present context and circumstances. Social partners have also come together to agree on a more recent agreement on digitalisation, concluded in 2020. This framework agreement specifically tackles telework and modalities of connecting and disconnecting from work, and it is currently being implemented at national, regional and local level. In this specific field it is equally important to duly take into account the concerns on proportionality, subsidiarity and better law-making principles. All proposals for Union action – and this is absolutely fundamental and applies also to the right to disconnect and eventually action in this field – must be subject, under Article 154 of the Treaty, to consultation with the EU’s social partners, who may decide to act by means of agreements, to act by negotiation between themselves. So anyway, this door is open – wide open. Before deciding on any action on the right to disconnect, the Commission certainly has to apply this Article and will also discuss with social partners on these aspects. As a certain number of Member States, as I recalled already, have already introduced a right to disconnect, many companies also establish this important right through agreements with their social partners, because they have understood what the rapporteur has described: people are not robots, people have limits. So, if you want to have better productivity, you cannot just occupy people 24 hours a day and seven days a week. So I think this is an important contribution, economic and social again, and this shows the importance of this right to disconnect for the good functioning of companies. And very often, by the way, it’s IT companies who have introduced this right to disconnect. It underlines also the crucial role of social partners in this field. Therefore, the Commission is inviting social partners to proactively work together in order to come to an adequate solution for the benefit of workers and companies. Certainly the Commission is ready to accompany and support them in this endeavour, and then the right of the Treaty – also of Article 225 – is absolutely there and can be used by the Commission if needed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I have listened to your speeches and I have not heard anyone who is against this right to disconnect. What for? Because it's just common sense.  As I have said and as some have also said, you cannot require a person, no matter how good, to be available at all times. We can demand it for a while but if we go beyond that time, well there will be a return. Return is occupational diseases, stress, burn-out. Diseases often of our time and diseases that have terrible impacts on people, but also have considerable financial consequences on all our social protection systems. Let me just make a brief reminder. 102 years ago, in a member country, not to mention France, an eight-hour law on working time was passed. It was a huge achievement, claimed all over Europe, and not just in Europe for that time. Some thought it was the end of the economy, the crisis, the end of productivity. Well technology already at the time taught that this was not the case. Moreover, the ILO's Convention Number 1, which was created at the same time in 1919, dealt exactly with 8 hours of daily work. I believe that today we are in a different situation, but we are also in a technological revolution, we are in an upheaval of the world of work. And so we must take the measure of this upheaval and its impact on humans, on human work.  This Parliament, together with the previous Commission, has adopted an important directive on work-life balance. One cannot advocate this balance on the one hand and on the other hand, absolutely open the door to all excesses. Moreover, which, logically, reasonably, could defend such excesses. Yes it is true, there can not be in this area a solution that applies to all types of companies. That is why social partners have a fundamental role to play.  But at the same time I say that, while I should be pleased that a number of Member States have already enshrined, as has been pointed out, in their legislation this right to disconnection, which must be declined according to companies by the social partners, well, as a European I have some difficulty in accepting that this right is accessible to certain nationals. , some workers in some countries but not all Europeans.

I am convinced that FISC will manage to build broad majorities inside and outside this House, because what I have seen from discussions with the different political groups is that we have at least one notion of fairness in common — that is that everyone has to pay taxes.  That is the rule, and there are no exceptions to the rule. Not for billionaires, not for big polluters and not for big corporates. This brings me to the blacklist of tax havens: the list of non—cooperative jurisdictions. It was long a deep wish of the European Parliament to have this list. Indeed, in 2017 we got our way when it was established for the first time. It was and is a good idea to name, to shame and, above all, to change. Change because being on the list should have, and must have, real consequences — both for the countries on the list and for the businesses that operate from those countries. But the Member States that ultimately decide on the list have forgotten just one thing: to include actual tax havens.  The Tax Justice Network has shown that the countries included on the list are responsible for only 2% of global tax avoidance. By comparison, the Netherlands alone — the country where I come from — is responsible for 8.5%, and the number one offender is the Cayman Islands, responsible for 16.5%. The list does not work yet.  And the nasty truth is that it’s not getting better; it’s getting worse. The Virgin Islands, Bermuda, Jersey. These are some of the world’s most renowned tax havens and they have been removed from the list.  Commissioner and Minister, imagine the shock I and others in the House felt when we learned that the Cayman Islands, the number one tax haven in the world, had been removed as well. With the Member States failing to live up to their duty, it is for the Parliament to step up and tell it like it is. This list is confusing and ineffective. You have got to fix this. Give the list teeth with strict criteria and make it bite with defensive measures. No countries without a corporate tax system or with low effective corporate tax rates should go free. Europe is suffering from Member States’ failure to live up to their duty. Our citizens are losing EUR 140 billion each year from corporate income tax losses. This is money that could have been spent on housing, on health, on care or, if you wish, on income taxes.  Our citizens want something different. They expect something different. 86% of them say that they want the EU to fight tax avoidance and tax evasion. Go fix it! There is a democratic deficit. The citizen expects, yet the politicians do not deliver. A democratic deficit is not just that, but also the lack of transparency, because the discussions on taxation take place in the back rooms, although scrutiny and accountability are part and parcel of our democracy. Taxation seems to be a debate for technocrats alone at this stage, and this should be changed. What you see in the resolution is that it calls for democratic standards to be obeyed. More specifically, it calls on the Council to disclose the participating members, the topics of discussion, the technical assessments, the summaries, the minutes and the conclusions of these meetings.  It also calls on the Chair of the Code of Conduct Group to visit the FISC committee regularly. It is part and parcel of our democratic process; scrutiny and accountability are part of that.  The resolution also calls for us to look in the mirror, because to fight tax avoidance through non-EU tax havens adds up to hypocrisy if we don’t look in the mirror. When we do, we will find that it’s not a pretty sight.

Thank you for bringing this question to the plenary, as it is an important issue. The EU and its Member States are committed to strengthening good tax governance, fair taxation, global tax transparency and the fight against tax fraud and evasion, both at EU level and globally. The Ecofin Council produced a set of conclusions on 27 November 2020 on fair and effective taxation. This provided political guidance on further work on a modern EU tax environment. These conclusions also express the Council’s views on the Commission tax action plan, issued in July 2020, on good tax governance in the EU and beyond. The Council reiterated the importance of supporting the principles of good tax governance through the continuation of the successful work undertaken so far in the context of the Code of Conduct Group, including the EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes, which should be further pursued and enhanced where necessary.  The Council therefore requested that the Code of Conduct Group continue its work. It also stressed the importance of fair treatment within the EU with respect to third countries and jurisdictions, while maintaining a continuous dialogue with third countries as well as with the OECD. The Code of Conduct Group will also pursue its discussions on ways and means to further improve the work on the code. This should take into account the successful lessons from other experience gained so far.  The EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes was revised most recently in October 2020 following an in-depth review of the implementation of the commitments made by third countries’ jurisdictions that are part of the process. The next revision of the EU list, which is scheduled for February at the Ecofin Council, is prepared by the Code of Conduct Group.  As regards defensive measures towards non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes, Member States and the Council adhere to a number of guiding principles. The defensive measures can have considerable consequences for the listed jurisdictions. The following aspects can be mentioned in this context. First, the key objective of the list is to ensure change, as Mr Tang said, and not punish the listed jurisdiction. Being listed entails reputational damage and we see that this aspect tangibly contributes to the efficiency of the EU list. More and more jurisdictions change their practice and adopt tax good governance; standards that are also applicable between the EU Member States.  So, on the second aspect, a number of EU-level defensive measures are being applied vis-à-vis the listed jurisdictions, and these can have financial consequences. The work in this area is also continuing with the assistance of the Commission.  And third, Member States are also free to apply national lists or defensive measures that go beyond what is agreed at the EU level or in the intergovernmental context of the Code of Conduct Group.  Finally, it is important to recall that the measures agreed in 2017 in the Council were reviewed in 2019 in the Code of Conduct Group, and Member States agreed to continue this work during this year. This reflects the fact that Member States have different legal systems, different laws and it takes time to design new measures. Work on defensive measures will not stop. Coordination will continue, and it’s likely to increase in the near future. Should the Commission choose to table a legislative proposal in this area, it will of course be examined by the Council in accordance with the treaty requirements and taking into account the limits of the EU’s competence in these matters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 261, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Paolo Gentiloni", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable members, first of all let me thank the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) and Subcommittee on Tax Matters (FISC), and the rapporteur, Mr Tang, for putting the fight against tax evasion and tax avoidance at the forefront of the agenda. The EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions will continue to play an important role in the years to come. And, I think, especially at this moment in time, in order to help overcome the economic and social crisis also caused by the pandemic, we have to strengthen these tools. The Commission announced a commitment to work to strengthen these tools in July 2020, and this commitment will continue. Of course, there is a need to improve tax good governance, not only globally, but also within the EU. Member States are subject to reviews under various tools, and these tools include the Code of Conduct for business taxation, whose reform is an absolute priority, and infringement procedures in the areas directly covered by EU law. I count on the European Parliament to continue pushing for an ambitious agenda. I am glad to hear the Council’s commitment in this direction.  The Commission actively engaged with Member States in the different Council groups to discuss the follow-up to the communication on tax good governance in Europe and beyond. As a result, the Council adopted conclusions, as it was reminded, which take note of the communication and reiterate the importance of the principles of tax good governance and the need to enhance the EU listing process. This is an important step as it recognises that more work is needed. I have in mind, in particular, the revision of the Code of Conduct for business taxation. Any change in this respect will have a major impact on the EU listing process. The progress on the discussions of minimally effective taxation in the context of Pillar Two of the OECD’s report are accordingly crucial for the code and, consequently, also for the EU listing process, and will have an effect on our fair taxation criterion, including zero-tax jurisdictions.  The EU listing also requires improved administrative cooperation, in particular through the exchange of tax information. This is why the Commission will continue to work on extending the EU list criteria to cover effective exchanges of information under the Common Reporting Standard, country-by-country reporting between tax authorities and beneficial ownership information. I believe that it is also necessary that we focus on the right jurisdictions, and consider whether any relevant jurisdiction is missing from our radar. This is the reason why the Commission is working on a revision of the scoreboard, and uses enhanced selection criteria for identifying jurisdictions and prioritising their screening under the EU listing process. The Commission is also looking forward to assessing the actions undertaken by Member States towards enacting domestic defensive measures vis-à-vis listed jurisdictions. I reiterate on this occasion that we are ready to take any necessary initiatives in case the results are not in line with our expectations, including by way of legislative proposal. Finally, I believe that the Council should report regularly to the Parliament regarding its work on non-cooperative jurisdictions. This would improve the mutual understanding of the process and would help to focus on improving the EU listing process.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 262, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Lídia PEREIRA", "mepid": "197738", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Mr President, in a time of crisis when we need all the resources that we have been able to mobilise, starting with the financial budgets, our national budgets cannot continue to lose 20% of the revenue stemming from corporation tax on transfers to tax havens every year.

This is only unacceptable and the European Union must do a much better job of combating tax havens. The lack of ambition, consistency and transparency of the blacklist of tax havens has to be overcome definitively. As our subcommittee chairman and rapporteur Paul Tang has already said, the Cayman Islands have recently been removed from the list of tax havens. Citizens see, but they don't believe.  It is estimated that this jurisdiction accounts for more than 16% of tax losses globally, a daunting figure higher than the GDP of many Member States. It's not admissible! We cannot continue like this and we welcome the determination revealed here by the Presidency of the Council.  With this resolution, we propose to revise the criteria of this list, with greater transparency and democratic scrutiny, with a criterion that includes in the list any country that does not simply cover taxes, as well as those with very low taxes, below a minimum rate set by the Union.

The territories listed represent less than 2% of the global tax revenue losses, which obviously raises questions about the effectiveness of this list.

A whole series of jurisdictions have been added to the list and taken down again. Most of them were small island states in the South Pacific, whose non-cooperation on tax issues was probably due to the fact that they do not have an efficient tax administration. It is time to think fundamentally about the meaning and nonsense of this list and also to see whether it really helps us to combat tax havens. I believe that we have three problems, which I shall also raise briefly. Firstly, with a few exceptions, the list does not meet the right states. The Council has always been courageous in putting small states on the list that are somewhere on small islands, but has always shied away from tackling large chunks. Why is the state of Delaware – after all, one of that state has been sworn in as president today – not on this list, to give just one example? Secondly, the so-called defence measures linked to the list are simply not enough. So here too we should think about what it really means to create sanctions.

The second big element is the absolute absence of transparency, accountability, control by this Parliament, so that if we take into account that the Council incorporates assessments or criteria that have nothing to do with the fight against tax havens and that, moreover, there is no democratic accountability, we have a list that is not credible.

Thank you for the floor and thank you to colleagues for also making a great deal of good comments. When it comes to the EU tax list, I hardly know where to start. For what is the EU's list of so-called non-cooperative jurisdictions? According to the European Council's website, it is a list of non-EU countries that encourage harmful tax practices that erode eu countries' tax revenues from companies. This may sound OK on paper, but the reality is that only two percent of the lost tax haven-billions are lost in countries on the EU list.  Honestly, what the hell is that list at all? In the fall, the favourite destination of the Cayman Islands fell off the list, and already the list includes only one of the world's 20 worst tax havens.

Mr Giegold mentioned EUR 360 billion. This enormous dimension also moves very fast and quickly, adapting to different situations, different countries, frequently with new methods.  It’s a challenge for us. What can we say, I think, first, we have a tool. I understand the limits, the difficulties, the criticism towards this tool; but indeed for a few years we have had this tool. I assure you from the short experience that I have here in the Commission, but also from previous experiences, that this blacklisting is in any case something effective for the countries involved. This tool should be strengthened. We have to work on criteria to avoid the risk of formal decisions being inconsistent with substantial reality in tax havens. Second, I think we have to control defensive measures taken in Member States against blacklisted countries. Because if these measures are not there, or not rightly there, I think the Commission should propose to intervene, as I said in my introduction, with a legislative proposal.  Then we have a different file from the one of the non-cooperative jurisdictions, which is the file of what happens within our club, and within our Member States. Is there a problem with aggressive tax planning, with a race to the bottom? Yes, there is a problem. We have repeated this in our semester surveillance process for years, and I want to seize this opportunity to stress the fact that we not only have the process going on with Pillar II in the OECD discussion, but we also have the recovery and resilience facility with the commitment to be consistent with country—specific recommendations, and in a few cases these country—specific recommendations give some importance to the issue of aggressive tax planning.

Ensuring that the EPPO starts functioning at the earliest opportunity is a priority for us. In this perspective it’s also equally important that the EPPO, with its important mandate of prosecuting the crimes which affect the financial interests of the Union, is a solid and credible office. This is in the interests of all stakeholders, including the EU institutions and the EU citizens. We all hope that the EPPO will start functioning as currently planned in March this year.  In achieving this objective, the Council has worked in close cooperation with this Parliament, which resulted in the appointment in October 2019 of the Chief European Prosecutor. The Council has actively worked on the establishment of the EPPO with a series of legislative texts, aiming at implementing the EPPO Regulation. In 2019-2020 substantive work was done with the objective of appointing European prosecutors. In July 2020 the decision appointing European prosecutors – one for each of the 22 participating Member States in this reinforced cooperation – was adopted by the Council, and this allowed the EPPO college to start functioning in September 2020. The work which led to the appointment of the European prosecutors was carried out in full transparency and in the full respect for the applicable rules. I want to underline here that the Council implementing decision on the operating rules of the selection panel states, and I quote, ‘the selection panel shall rank the candidates according to their qualifications and experience. The ranking shall indicate the selection panel’s order of preference and shall not be binding on the Council’. The Council thoroughly analysed the selection panel’s opinion on every candidate and followed the proposed ranking on 19 nominations. In the other three it decided otherwise, making use of its discretionary power. Moreover, in addition to the legislative acts published in the Official Journal, all documents pertaining to the process have been handed to the interested parties when requested and in accordance with the Council’s rules on access to documents.  I’m aware of the fact that some of the appointments have been contested and that there has been criticism regarding the designation of prosecutors of some Member States, including my own. I speak here on behalf of the Council and I do not want to go into detail at this stage. So I will listen to you carefully and I will be ready to answer your questions.  But ladies and gentlemen, let me state that the establishment of the EPPO has required much more time than expected, with huge delays linked particularly with the pandemic. It is now time to combine our efforts to allow the EPPO to become operational and start its activities on the protection of the Union’s financial interests against criminal offences.

It is completely irresponsible. There is an independent panel of experts who’ve made a selection and they’ve made a recommendation. There was absolutely no reason why the Council should deviate from that recommendation, because that’s what we have the panel for. Because if you want to choose the best person for EPPO, then all the Council had to do was follow the recommendation. What other objectives could you have in deviating from the recommendation other than, I don’t know, creating jobs for the boys? I don’t know.

I praise Ms Kövesi for the work done in the past year to set up the office as quickly and as diligently as possible. But to ensure independence from the politics here in Brussels or in the capitals, the EPPO needs a body of prosecutors appointed with utmost respect for the rules established and without any shred of doubt as to their individual independence from those appointing them. And that brings me to the heart of today’s debate. Prosecutors in the EPPO are meant to be appointed based on the results of an evaluation done by an independent panel of European-level experts. The problem is that the Council disregarded those evaluations – and not only once, and on the basis of false information. Which begs the question: why would a political body overwrite the results of an evaluation based on merit and competence? Being a prosecutor is not about being politically astute so as to justify a political judgment; it is about being competent, about holding anyone to account no matter how powerful, whether it is politically opportune or not. That is what the Council needs to understand and that is what we as Parliament need to uphold with full force.

I shall say, however, this: allegations of political interference in the appointment of the prosecutor of the Portuguese. I would like to stress that this appointment decision was based on the opinion of the Superior Council of the Public Prosecutor's Office, a judicial body, independent of the executive power, provided for in the Portuguese Constitution, composed of nineteen members, of whom the majority prosecutors, but also includes members appointed by the Assembly of the Republic. This Council attributed the highest rank to the prosecutor José Guerra. I would stress that the candidates were also heard in the Assembly of the Portuguese Republic in full transparency. This appointment was independent. In addition, it is important to remember what i said initially. According to the applicable rules, the classification indicating the order of preference of the Selection Committee is not binding on the Council, which enjoys full discretion in this matter. In the Portuguese, the order established by the Superior Council of the Public Prosecutor's Office was maintained, in which there was no political interference. Thirdly, some comments on the letter where Portugal expresses its preference to follow the opinion of this independent Council, sent on 29 November 2019. This letter was considered by the Council, together with the reasoned opinion of the Selection Committee on the Portuguese appointees.  Unfortunately, it contains two lapses and let me clarify what those two lapses were.  The letter refers to the prosecutor José Guerra, using the title courtesy of Deputy Attorney General, although it is, in fact, Attorney General of the Republic. This reference is a mere element of identification and in no way intended to value their qualifications or serve as a criterion of preference.  The Council assessed the experience of prosecutor José Guerra not on the basis of his professional category, but on the basis of his experience of more than three decades in the Public Prosecutor's Office, which includes 12 years in Eurojust in various roles.  The letter also states that this prosecutor was involved in the investigation and trial phases of the UGT case, although in fact he participated only in the trial phase. These elements were clarified by the Minister of Justice in a letter to the Council on 4 January 2021.  These lapses, although regrettable, did not influence the Council's assessment of the merits and professional qualifications of Portuguese candidates, a fact which is evident from the letters sent to unselected candidates. In addition, the curriculum vitae of the prosecutor José Guerra was sent to the Council at the beginning of this process, and is totally correct, not containing any of the aforementioned inaccuracies. I hope that these clarifications have dispelled any doubts about Portugal's commitment to the European Public Prosecutor's Office in a spirit of full transparency, but also with the commitment of the Presidency of the Council and the Council's commitment to this enhanced cooperation project, as important as this one to protect the Financial Interests of the Union.

This, while permitted, has raised issues that require clarity and maximum transparency about the decisions taken. The field must be cleared of any shadow of improper political interference. We cannot allow heated debates such as those that have arisen over the appointment of the European Public Prosecutor of Portugal to tilt confidence in the European Public Prosecutor's Office.

We are dealing with a Member State's attempt, even when it is holding the Presidency of the European Council, to seriously harm the rules and values of the rule of law. We mustn't shy away from words. The Portuguese Government lied to the European Council when it presented the professional file of the prosecutor to be part of the EPPO. Lying and lack of accountability are not acceptable behaviours in the functioning of the European institutions.  I, along with my colleagues in the EPP, call on the European Commission to investigate how the Government of Portugal has followed the procedure for appointing the prosecutor to be part of the EPPO.  This government's attempt to promote its favourite prosecutor questions the credibility of the EPPO, the institution that must defend the EU budget, i.e. every European citizen's money, from corruption.  The facts are simple and clear: when a Member State officially submits false information on the basis of which the European Council bases its decisions, there is a breach of the EU Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, on the obligation of good faith cooperation. The EPP does not accept such abuse and we call for the withdrawal of the prosecutor concerned and the initiation of an investigation by the European Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 297, "date": "2021-01-20.json", "name": "Ewa KOPACZ", "mepid": "197525", "text": "  The next item is the vote.
