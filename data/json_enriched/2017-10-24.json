[{"id": 0, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "The first item on the agenda is the discussion on the statements of the European Council and the Commission on the conclusions of the European Council meeting of 19 and 20 October 2017 and the presentation of the leaders' agenda \"Building our future together\" (2017 / 2745 (RSP)). After the proposals of the European Parliament, which you will find in your offices in a summary, we heard the speech by the President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker on the Commission proposals, and today we will listen to the President of the European Council in this hemicycle, who wants to continue to be the venue for the debate on the future of the European Union. That is why, at the last meeting of the European Council, I invited the heads of government to participate in a series of meetings in this Parliament with representatives of European citizens. However, when things occur in Europe that offend our sensitivity, I would like to remind everyone that we cannot talk about the future of our Union, the future of the Eurozone, the future of our institutions, the future of our citizens, if we do not have the strength and the will to defend the founding values ​​of our Union. We are together, we are part of a community if we share values, we must always remember this. And today I cannot but firmly condemn what happened in Rome, Italy, where a group of hooligans used the image of Anne Frank to offend fans of another sports club. Using the image of Anne Frank as an offense against others is a very serious matter. Everyone in our Union has the right to practice their religion. Jewish communities are part of our European Union; I am proud to have European fellow citizens of the Jewish religion and I believe that anti-Semitism should remain only a horrible experience of our past, a horrible experience of the century that has concluded.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 1, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "   President of the European Council. – Mr President, as you know, I am obsessed by unity. This obsession was with me during the last European Council, but in fact it has been with me since the first days of my work in Brussels. This is why I rejected the idea of removing Greece from the eurozone in 2015. And it is also why I pursued a common position of the EU vis-à-vis Russia during the conflict in Ukraine. For many months I was building agreement among the 27 in order to give Prime Minister Cameron arguments to stay in the EU, even though this meant that each of the 27 had to make a sacrifice. Unfortunately, this was not enough for the Brits. After Brexit, I worked towards creating unity of the 27 in the negotiations with the United Kingdom. We have shown also during the last European Council that no one can divide the 27 in these negotiations. Striving for unity is also the main reason for creating the Leaders’ Agenda. Last Friday, all the leaders agreed that the priority for them is unity among the 27. This was voiced in unison. On this most important issue to me, we reached full understanding right from the start. The Leaders’ Agenda invalidated a dangerous assumption that together we can only stand still, and that we can only move forward when we divide. It is about reconciling dynamism and unity. About being ambitious and staying together at the same time. This, of course, does not rule out enhanced cooperation as the last resort, open to all, and in accordance with the Treaties. My intention is to build on what connects, not on what divides. But it does not mean that we should not stand up with courage to the issues that are – or could be – divisive so that we can find common solutions to them. I will just mention migration, the EMU and Brexit. When it comes to the migration crisis, I appealed from the very beginning to build Europe’s response on what connects us: on the protection of our external borders. I did so being aware that there are also ideas that put Member States in a permanent conflict. One such question is relocation: precisely speaking, the mandatory quotas. On this issue, consensus is as unlikely today as it was many months ago. But I do see a real chance of full agreement by June on matters like protecting external borders; decisive support for front—line countries (Italy, Greece, Spain and Bulgaria); strategy vis-à-vis Africa and adequate support for international organisations helping refugees and migrants – UNHCR, IOM and the World Food Programme; European management over return and readmission policy; and most of the elements of the Dublin reform. If on these matters we are really effective, we will be close to a lasting solution to the migration crisis. As regards EMU reform, following the publication of the Five Presidents’ Report no one should have any doubts what we need to do: everything is crystal clear. The problem is Member States’ conflicting interests. One of the first effects of the Leaders’ Agenda is the agreement to find potential solutions in the nearest possible future, despite these differences. I will do everything in my power to take the first very concrete steps by June towards establishing the European Monetary Fund and strengthening the stability of the Banking Union.  I still believe that this is possible. In June it will become clear if I am an incurable optimist. But one thing I can promise you today: if we do not reach agreement by June, I will say precisely why it was not possible, and who is responsible. As for the Brexit negotiations, we have managed to build and maintain unity among the 27, but ahead of us is still the toughest stress test. If we fail it, the negotiations will end in our defeat. We must keep our unity, regardless of the direction of the talks. The EU will be able to rise to every scenario as long as we are not divided. It is in fact up to London how this will end: with a good deal, no deal or no Brexit. But in each of these scenarios we will protect our common interest only by being together. We continue to look for the best way towards a Europe that is united, solidary and sovereign. Our quest must be accompanied by a constant and profound reflection on the essence of our community. I would like to say a few words on three of its dimensions. First of all, we are a territorial community, which means that we have a common territory and common external borders. Our duty is to protect them. The migration crisis has made us aware, with full force, of the need to rebuild effective control of our external borders, while the aggressive behaviour of certain third countries, and the destabilisation around Europe, has made us aware of the need to defend our territory. For this reason, we want to launch Permanent Structured Cooperation on Defence, the so-called PESCO, by the end of this year. In order to protect our external borders, we must build a model of durable and efficient financing on a bigger scale than ever before. It should become a part of our discussions on the future MFF. Secondly, we are a cultural community, which does not mean that we are better or worse – we are simply different from the outside world. Our openness and tolerance cannot mean walking away from protecting our heritage. We have the right and obligation to care for what distinguishes us from other cultures – not in order to be against someone, but to be ourselves. Without a feeling of superiority, but with a feeling of justified pride. I remember a great hashtag by one of your leaders, which said: ‘I am European and I am proud’. This is why the first point on the Leaders’ Agenda for our meeting in Gothenburg in November is culture and education. Thirdly, we are a political community. It is high time we renewed our vows in the name of our political values enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on the European Union. Let me quote: ‘The EU is founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities.’ These values are common to the Member States in a society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail. I would like to remind all those in power, all the Member States, that by signing the Treaty you have also signed this article. So either you respect it, or you clearly say you reject it, with all the consequences of this fact. Finally, I would like to refer to an issue it would be hard to avoid, being here in Strasbourg: the future composition of the European Parliament. For this topic, I have planned a special European Council in February next year. As you know, we must deal with this matter because of Brexit and because of the changing demography. I take all the proposals that have surfaced in this debate seriously; they are all interesting and pro-European ideas. I, personally, believe that the most natural solution would be to adopt a simple rule: fewer countries, fewer mandates. It is not only pragmatic and logical, but also what is expected by public opinion. Of course, such a solution in no way invalidates the idea of transnational lists. I am aware that this will be our common decision, since Parliament will be proposing and co-deciding on this matter. This is why I would like you to take such a possibility into account. When I was here in March this year, you may remember that I recalled a proverb: ‘If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together’. Today I feel we have a real chance to go together, far and faster.

I would first like to recall, in a spirit of solidarity, the tragedy that Portugal and Spain have just experienced. These terrible fires shocked us all, challenged us. This was also the case for the torrential rains which hit the three Baltic countries a few months ago. Solidarity is a key virtue of our Union, and when one of us is confronted with difficulties, it is obvious, necessary, elementary, for the European Union to come to the aid of those who are suffering. This is the reason why I have asked Commissioner Stylianides to reflect within a month - in fact, before the end of the year - on the remodeling, the re-articulation of our civil protection mechanisms, which are not working. 100 %. It is not normal that, when a fire breaks out on a Sunday morning in Portugal, we have to wait until Wednesday evening to see the first European plane arrive for help. We have to speed up the process. Until then, we will trigger, and check if they are applicable, all the mechanisms of the European Solidarity Fund for Portugal, Spain and the three Baltic States. I will not develop in front of you the proposals that the Commission has made in the area of ​​migration policy and the digital internal market. All the proposals that the Commission has drawn up are on the table in Parliament and in the Council, and I would like to invite you to speed up the work, in particular as regards the common asylum system. We are wasting time and it is urgent that we agree on all of these proposals. I I would like to pay tribute to the LIBE committee of your Parliament, which took the right decisions a week ago and I congratulate you on it. We talked about Africa. We are always talking about Africa, and I regularly call on the members of the Council, that is, the Member States, to match their actions with their words. We have set up an Emergency Trust Fund for Africa, endowed with 1.8 billion euros, with the hope - I must say naively today - that the Member States will make exactly the same effort. They did not do so, which means that the Commission had to increase its contribution to 2.9 billion, to be financed from the European budget. Member States have so far made a considerable effort to make EUR 175 million available to this fund. It's scandalous. Talking about Africa with tears in your eyes, and not doing what you are committed to, is unacceptable. (Applause) As regards digital Europe, the Commission has proposed 43 initiatives, 24 of which are legislative in nature. To date, the Council and Parliament have adopted six directives. It’s not really impressive and so it will be necessary - since everyone is talking about digital - to get things done. The same goes for everything relating to broadband networks and fixed networks. As far as 5G is concerned, we would like to speed up the work that will allow us, by 2020, to make bands of the radio spectrum available to economic operators. These decisions must be made as quickly as possible. Obviously, we discussed trade policy among ourselves, at the initiative of some of us, including President Macron. I reminded the members of the European Council that the Commission continues to believe that it is necessary and urgent to conclude trade agreements with the Mercosur countries. It's a vast economic complex. It will be the most important trade agreement the European Union has concluded to date. But we insist on the need to put in place mechanisms of reciprocity, which will prove to Europeans and others who observe us that Europe is open, but that Europe is not offered, and , therefore, more emphasis needs to be placed on elements that reflect the will to establish reciprocal regimes. Herr President, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! In wenigen Wochen werden wir uns in Göteborg treffen, um unter anderem und vornehmlich über Sozialpolitik zu reden. Im November 2017 machen wir etwas, was wir uns im November 1997 vorgenommen hatten. Im November 1997 fand der erste Beschäftigungsgipfel der Europäischen Union statt. Ich bin wahrscheinlich der einzige, der sich daran erinnert, weil ich im Vorsitz war. In den Schlussfolgerungen steht, dass einmal pro Jahr ein Sondergipfel zu Fragen der Beschäftigungspolitik stattfinden soll. Er findet jetzt 2017 –20 Jahre später - statt. Ich kann mich über die Emsigkeit in Sachen Sozialpolitik nur wundern. Aber gut ist, dass dieser Gipfel stattfindet, und wir müssen dafür sorgen, dass die soziale Dimension Europas nicht ein frommer Spruch bleibt, Sondern dass wir die sozialen Absichten - die es gibt - auch mit Inhalt füllen. (Beifall) In dem Sinne bin ich froh, zufrieden, fast glücklich darüber, dass es uns gestern im Rat gelungen ist, uns auf die Entsenderichtlinie ist verständigen. Nicht alles ist bei dem gefundenen Kompromiss perfekt, aber dass es überhaupt möglich war - auch mit Hilfe des Europäischen Parlaments, auch auf Druck des Europäischen Parlaments -, in Sachen Entsenderichtlinie zu Fortschritten zu kommenimmung Lob. Dass die Sozialminister sich gestern auch inhaltlich, von der Sache her und von der Form her auf den europäischen Sozialpfeiler, den die Kommission vorgeschlagen hat, haben einigen können, ist auch eine gute Nachricht.In Sachen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion wird die Kommission am 6. Dezember ihre Endvorschläge vorlegen.Wir werden in Vorbereitung des Dezember-Gipfels hier im Hause über die Vorschläge der Kommission in Sachen Wirtschafts- und Währungsunion zu reden haben.Heute nimmt die Kommission ihr Arbeitsprogramm für nächstes Jahr an.Dieses Arbeitsprogramm soll dazu führen, dass Europa einiger, stärker und demokratischer wird.Herr VizePresident Timmermans wird Ihnen, wenn ich richtig informiert bin, heute Nachmittag im Plenum das Programm der Europäischen Kommission vorstellen.What should I say about Brexit?I would like to say that the Commission is not negotiating in a hostile mood.We want a deal.Those who don’t want a deal, the ‘no dealers’, have no friends in the Commission.We want a fair deal with Britain and we will have a fair deal with Britain.‘No deal’ is not our working assumption.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 3, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "Mr President of the European Commission, with regard to Portugal and Spain, Parliament shares your position and the position of the Commission.I wish to inform you that yesterday I announced in plenary that you, the President of the Council and I have decided to donate the money of the Princess of Asturias Prize to the Portuguese and the Spaniards victims of the tragedy which struckthese two countries a week ago.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, first of all, the European Council discussed the right priorities. First, about Brexit. We have unity, thanks to the commitment of all the leading figures and personalities. We underlined that there is not sufficient progress. We clarified that there is no cherry-picking possible. You are preparing a scenario for leaving without an agreement. I think that is a good step, and the business community - that is what we see from the London side - is getting more and more nervous, and the Brexiteers have no common plan for the future of their country, and especially the relationship towards the European Union. That is the outcome, and I look to what happens in the Council and we look to what happens in London. One thing is, additionally, clear for us as the European People's Party (EPP): if we are discussing about the treaty, the contents of which will, finally, be asked for in this House, then we are ready for a kind of a transitional period. But I have now to clarify that we cannot accept that a country outside the European Union will have the same conditions and the same status as a country inside the European Union, so there must be a difference. That is Brexit. The second thing is about innovation. I thank Donald Tusk for this priority: that is our future, it is needed. Combine resources, strengthen our budget: that is what we need, and we need clear projects. One of these projects is Defense Union - this was also a discussion. The EPP is strongly in favor. We have a momentum on the table to go forward with our Defense Union. One aspect is important for us. On the one hand, that we discuss about funds, about better financing of our defense structure, but I think towards the people we also need visibility about what we are doing there. I can give you one concrete example which we are discussing in the EPP Group. There is a new threat about cybersecurity which is on the table. We think that small / medium countries and even the bigger countries in the European Union cannot defend themselves alone anymore in this globalized cyberworld. That means for us: let's combine our forces, let's really establish a European cyber-defense brigade where we have this at European level, and let's make it visible with officials and soldiers who have on their uniforms the European flag, to make people aware that Europe together can defend our cyber infrastructure. Another point was the discussion about Turkey. As the EPP Group, we welcome the cut in accession aid. We must make it clear that we are concerned and concerned about developments in Turkey. We will do the same in the European Parliament with this week's budget: cut accession aid. In this respect we are going hand in hand in the same direction. And of course we have to talk about the targeted use of funds. Therefore: A commitment to the funds for the refugees is also necessary. But we also need more clarity in our relations with Turkey. And we have to be aware that we need a partnership, but full membership cannot be a further goal, as this plenary has repeatedly expressed. I was surprised that the Turkish President was recently in Warsaw and the Polish government, which is so profiled by opposing the influx of Muslims and strongly polemicized against Islam and the influx of Muslims, was of the opinion that the Turkey must become a full member of the European Union. The consequence of this is that 80 million Turkish citizens will then have freedom of movement in the European Union - that is, they can freely choose their place of residence anywhere in Europe. From my point of view, it is difficult to fit together. One can address that. Dear colleagues, we have the priorities on the table. But we all know that we are too slow to implement - that was discussed. I just want to pick one point. In addition to the Africa issue, which Jean-Claude Juncker thankfully addressed very clearly, I would like to single out a second point. We have had us count it: It has now been fixed in the twentieth resolution of the European Council - for the twentieth time! - that one wants to build closer and stronger European border protection. This has been decided for the twentieth time! And what did we achieve? 1,500 officials! I once had it converted: If you had such a distance on the border from Strasbourg in France to Brussels, there would be an officer every 33 kilometers. A border guard would be standing every 33 kilometers with what we have set up today. And because of that: There is talk, but unfortunately far too little is done. That is why we must use the next few months, as our Commission President rightly encourages us to deliver now, to give answers now. And, dear colleagues, we have a momentum on the table that people in Europe see - the survey figures also show that people see that - how valuable this community is. The Catalans and also the British show us that it is a risk to question this European Union. That is why we must now use this positive momentum to further develop Europe. And because today - I may put it this way - the German Bundestag is also in the process of being constituted, I would also like to appeal to Berlin that the new Federal Government in Berlin take up this positive courage, this positive momentum, that Europe has a bright future.

President Juncker said well: we are in favor of an agreement, but the stalemate is determined by the unpreparedness of the British government. However, the separation of the United Kingdom is not the only rift affecting the European Union. We have other fractures: from Catalonia to Northern Italy, there are forces at work that foment divisions within our Europe. There is a sort of selfishness of the rich, on the one hand, a reverse Robin Hood syndrome, which wants to take away from the poorest regions to give to the richest ones, and I am not surprised that the tax issue is involved. There is nothing wrong with wanting more autonomy - I am a federalist, I am for a federal Europe, so I want more autonomy - but not at the expense of solidarity. Redistributing resources from rich regions to poorer ones is not a charitable act, but it is the foundation of the citizenship pact. Europe then risks another form of secession, more silent and more dramatic: the secession of the least, the detachment of those who can't take it anymore. The forgotten of globalization are rebelling against the order established in the last twenty years. And the paradox - we must be careful about this - is that to ride the wave of this revolt of the last is precisely those who have taken advantage of the system of recent years: it is often the billionaires, the multi-billionaires, who give voice to the anger of the last. Many small Trump are also growing in Europe, as we saw in the recent elections in the Czech Republic. If we do not want a \"Trumpized\" Europe, divided and weakened, we must act immediately to heal this double fracture, territorial and social. President Tusk presented his proposal for a new agenda for the European Council: more meetings, more efficient and more effective work ... fine, but we need to focus not only on the method, but on the effectiveness of the results. Our Parliament has given good proof of itself: it has approved the revision of the Dublin rules on asylum applications - it is a big step forward for the European Parliament, taken together, a historic step - and it has approved the revision of the Directive on posted workers. , again a big step forward for the European Parliament. So we, as an institution democratically elected by the citizens, are answering specific questions that our citizens ask us on two fundamental issues, and we want these dossiers to proceed and finalize with an agreement with the Council. And we want to give substance to the social pillar, which President Juncker recalled. After twenty years a Council has been formed, now we are not making the social pillar a slogan, because citizens have their pockets and ears full of slogans, they need concrete measures. The posting of the worker is a concrete measure, but if we also give an answer to unemployed young people, if we give an answer to the marginalized, to those who have no home, to those who are thrown out of technological progress and must be protected from the effects of globalization, then let's fill that magic word - \"social pillar\" - with concrete contents. Finally, an affectionate recommendation to the Council: be zealous about these things and care less about how the European Parliament is to be composed. It would be very strange for the European Parliament to tell the Council how it is to be formed; we do not accept the Council telling us what the European Parliament should look like in 2019.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, Gianni, I admire your idealism when you speak, and it is important that we all tackle poverty but I prefer community-led solutions rather than top-down. Let me just correct you on one of the myths that you highlighted, which is about Robin Hood’s motivations. Let us remember that Robin Hood stole money from the tax collector to give the money back to taxpayers. Let us remember that when we are looking at the Robin Hood story. Last week’s Council meeting highlighted one simple fact: that the EU is sometimes in danger of allowing idealism to get the better of pragmatism. This is certainly true when looking at the European Council’s and Parliament’s positions on the migration package and negotiations with the UK. The European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR) welcomes much of the Council’s current strategy in tackling the migration crisis, closing trafficking routes across the Mediterranean, strengthening cooperation with international partners, returning unsuccessful applicants and strengthening the role of Frontex. Two years ago the ECR published these papers that called for exactly these kinds of sensible measures. Maybe if they had been introduced at the time, then maybe there would be more confidence in our migration and asylum system today. Instead, this Parliament appears to have a position on adopting a regulation that throws out the rulebook and long-established asylum laws to pursue a relocation system which has not exactly been a success, with proposals which mean that an asylum seeker would no longer have their application processed or even have a first admissibility check in the country that they arrive in and continuing to force quotas on countries which have already said that they do not support relocation. This approach gives asylum seekers false hope and EU citizens false solutions. These proposals will not increase solidarity but they may increase voters’ frustrations with politicians. Please let us rethink the unintended consequences of Parliament’s proposals in a pragmatic way. On the Brexit negotiations, let us be more pragmatic. As a British MEP, who leads one of the largest political groups in this House, who enjoys good relations with people on both sides of the negotiating table and who, like Jean-Claude, wants a mutually beneficial deal, I hope that we avoid becoming trapped by the sequencing of negotiations. For there to be real progress, we must take a step back and look at the process as a whole. Just as there needs to be an understanding from the UK as to where the EU 27 are coming from, there also needs to be an understanding from the EU 27 as to where the British people are coming from. The UK joined the EEC 40 years ago because more than anything it believed in open trade. That remains the UK’s main motivation for its current relationship with the EU, and it will be a major motivation in creating the UK’s future relationship with the EU and vice versa. So perhaps the more the EU talks about the issues that resonate with the UK, it may find that the UK is more willing to give concessions on the issues that the EU 27 care most about and prioritise. On both migration and UK negotiations, we may all find that while idealism may be a wonderful way to view the world and sequencing may appear to be perfectly logical, it will be pragmatism that delivers the solutions that we all want to see.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, first of all, I want to thank President Tusk for his intervention, and also for the publicity he has made for my hashtag campaign. Thank you. I am a proud European, so you are also an adept of it, Mr Tusk. And I have to tell you, after the State of the Union of our President of the Commission a few weeks ago, we got a speech at the Sorbonne by Emmanuel Macron, and we now have your agenda for the coming European Councils.  I have to confess that each time I have heard these proposals – this State of the Union, your agenda – I have felt an enormous excitement. The same eagerness that I felt when I was a young boy and was browsing through the colourful catalogues my mother received at the end of every year – the 3Suisses, was that in France? I think also in Luxembourg it exists. I think it is the Otto in Germany. The shiny things in these catalogues seemed always so far away, dreams on colourful paper, and to be very honest, that is rather what I am feeling today again – that we have great plans, that we have huge ambitions, but are we really ready now in this European Union to make the radical changes needed to make it happen? Because, Mr Tusk, there are a number of structural flaws in the European Union that we need to solve.  The first, as we know, is the unanimity rule that is still applied in the European Union, and especially in the Council, which has been blocking progress for decades now. The European Arrest Warrant has taken more than a decade to implement because of the unanimity rule; with the European Patents we had to wait more than 25 years because of the unanimity rule; the same is happening for the Energy Union – we do not have an Energy Union because of the unanimity rule; we do not have a fully-fledged Banking Union because of the unanimity rule. The Americans were capable in nine months to react to the financial crisis by cleaning up the banks, with an investment programme of USD 900 billion and with quantitative easing of USD 1.2 trillion, and we, after nine years, are still debating all this because of unanimity.  Maybe it is a good moment to recall that, because with the posting of workers the Council has taken a position for once. Why? Because they did not apply unanimity. For once, they have voted in the Council and have reached a position. So that is the first thing to do. Are we ready? There is a proposal by Jean—Claude Juncker to massively use ‘passerelles’ to solve the problem. Are we ready to finish this unanimity rule inside the Council and inside our institutions?  The second flaw is structural weakness: we know that there is a long, endless list of things, of doubts, of earmarks, of exceptions in our institutions. Are we ready to finish this Europe à la carte instead of continuing it as we still do?  Finally, the third disease we need to cure is what I call the ‘Potemkin syndrome’ of the European Union: that we always make beautiful plans, but without creating the necessary instruments, the necessary tools, or the necessary budget to make it happen. Schengen without the border and coastguard; the euro without the Treasury; foreign policy without a European defence community. So the moment of truth, Mr Tusk, is coming on the day – which is coming very soon – when we will decide on the new Multiannual Financial Framework. Are we really ready to implement these ambitious plans of Jean-Claude Juncker, of Emmanuel Macron, and of your agenda? Then it is necessary that we also be ready to open this financial framework and to give more than the former 1%, which is ridiculous if we want to fulfil all the ambitions that we have today. It is not really even 1% if you deduct from that the contributions that we received from the Member States and are going immediately back to the Member States; it is only 0.14% to protect our citizens against external threats, to protect our citizens and our borders internally, and at the same time to also organise the Currency Union. With 1%, sorry, that is not possible. To those populists and nationalists who are always saying ‘oh, this European superstate’, to have a budget of 1% and then talk about the European superstate is ridiculous and makes no sense at all. But that is the moment of truth. The moment of truth will not be the whole list of summits; the moment of truth will be when we discuss the money – when we discuss the budget, and when we discuss the new Multiannual Financial Framework.  That brings me, finally, Mr Tusk, to the remark you made on the composition of Parliament and the announcement that there will be an informal summit on it on 23 February. Fantastic! Maybe there are other things that I could organise to have an informal summit about, but you have to know that the legislative initiative for the composition of the Parliament is of this Parliament and not the European Council. I have to tell you that.  (Applause from the House) What I expect is for the European Council to back the proposal that will be made by a huge majority here in the House. That is what I expect! It will be a proposal based on the reduction of the number – that is a fair point. It will be a proposal that finally puts justice in the system with degressive proportionality, so that we do not take all five years to restart the work. And it will be – if everybody is of that opinion – a proposal in which we create a European democracy with transnationalists securing the Spitzenkandidaten. If I may give you one little piece of advice – do not open again the Spitzenkandidaten. We decided here in 2014 that it is an enormous achievement of European democracy. It is because of the Spitzenkandidaten that we have our President, Jean-Claude Juncker, here, and we will not accept any more changes to this system and this achievement of European democracy.

The last summit took place in an environment within the European Union that made it clear that the hasty assessments just a few weeks ago - we are out of the crisis - are not correct. Since then we have had the elections in Germany, we have had the elections in Austria, in the Czech Republic, we have the crisis in Spain - with a view to Catalonia. All of this shows that a lot is still in motion, that a lot is also boiling and that we have to face this together. You have now made it clear, Mr President, how you imagine that the Council will in future be better able to meet its responsibilities. You reminded the heads of government of their own political responsibility and - as I understood you - also made it clear that your concern is that responsibility cannot be pushed off forever, that important decisions that have to be made in the Council are not in the Nirvana will disappear, according to the motto: Lost in Translation, or will never appear again in the Bermuda Triangle of the Council. You promise that, on the basis of the decision notes you have submitted, it will be possible to determine within a very short time where agreement is reached, and wherever agreement cannot be reached from your point of view, you suggest that intensified cooperation can then begin . The following questions now arise for me: Does that mean that you have taken elements out of the proposals that the Commission made in the spring for the five scenarios and are already implementing them, without there really being a broad debate with the citizens and? Citizens in the European Union in the Member States? Mr Verhofstadt and others have also pointed out contradictions as regards the whole structure of democratic decision-making within the European Union. I would therefore I would also like to know whether the approval of the Leaders'Agenda means that there is a departure from the failed intergovernmental method that was once implemented by Chancellor Merkel and on the basis of which, for example, the fiscal compact was implemented - bypassing the European Parliament - but which obliges the Commission to enforce these intergovernmental agreements? Does the commitment to the political responsibility of the heads of state and government in the Council mean that the competences of bodies that are not democratically legitimized, such as the round of finance ministers of the Eurogroup, are reduced to the extent necessary and that in future it will no longer be possible this body, which does not feel obliged to Parliament at all, is able to impose large-scale conditions on member states and to significantly influence the lives of people there? Will the council clarify who will be the cook and who will be the waiter in the future? Or is it still possible for finance ministers to tell their heads of government what to do and what to think? What ideas did the Council members develop as to how the future cooperation with the European Parliament and also the national parliaments in this very shortened debate time, which they have called for and which they propose, will be concrete? How do we get involved? What are the consequences, possibly also for interinstitutional cooperation? It is no longer just the case that you can now say: We'll do it this way, that's it, and that's it. From my point of view, that won't work. The debate about the social pillar of which you spoke also showed that there is a need for clarification here. The Council received a proposal from us, the Commission made a proposal. But then it is first discussed for months how because parliament is then involved again at the end if it is supposed to co-sign. There is a need for clarification here, and that cannot simply be through postulating proposals. Only briefly about Brexit. My group is moving two things: We would like to have clarified that the Council defines in concrete terms what the criteria are between the Council meeting last week and the Council meeting in December, so that we can see that there is now sufficient progress. How do you measure that? Or is that more or less a political bargaining chip, and we'll see where it takes us? We are sticking to two points: We do not want the citizens of Great Britain or any other member state of the European Union to be punished for failing to conclude a treaty or for a no-deal. But we want a deal that ensures that citizens ‘rights and also the rights of the citizens in Northern Ireland are ultimately enforced, and that of course also includes sensible financial settlement. One more remark on the migration crisis. I have heard that by June you assume that you will be able to make progress on certain elements of the work on the migration crisis, to reach a certain agreement. But what I miss is a very clear announcement: an end to support for Libyan coastal protection as long as it does not comply with humanitarian obligations and blocks international sea rescue and maritime law, no criminalization of flight and no criminalization of international, private sea rescue operations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 9, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Mr President, dear President Tusk, it is always a pleasure to welcome you, and I am serious, because we are all convinced here that the consolidation and deepening of the European project will not be against the Member States but with them, and it is you who chair the Council. That is why, after what was arguably the best State of the Union address delivered here by President Juncker in September, I looked forward to hearing you discuss here your vision for the future of Europe. 'Europe. I must admit to you my disappointment, because in terms of the leaders' program, what you offer us is a schedule of meetings embellished with the subjects you want to deal with, a calendar ultimately like the one that our Parliament or the Commission has been publishing for years without anyone being moved by it. And so great news - heartily - the European Council is starting to organize its work. Who knows, maybe he will soon make his debates public? But beyond the joke, I want to point out the increasingly striking contrast between the institution you chair and the one to which I have the honor to belong. I would like to take as an example the asylum and migration policy, a key topic at last week's summit, during which you reaffirmed - and we obviously expected it - the option of fortress Europe, ready to pass the most infamous agreements with the regimes, even the most detestable warlords, so that they can assure us that none of these unfortunate people put a foot or a toe on the territory of the European Union. But, as no fortress, Mr Tusk, is impenetrable, it turns out that a number of our Member States continue to face the challenge of migration - I am of course thinking of Greece, Italy, Italy. 'Spain, Malta or Bulgaria - and they are left alone to face this challenge. It is of course the Dublin regulation I want to talk about. In June 2016, the European Commission, chaired by Mr Juncker, made a proposal to correct this unfair system. Last week, after an intense work masterfully carried out by Mrs Cecilia Wikström, here, Parliament improved the initial text so that from now on the Member States jointly assume the response to the challenge of migration and the reception of asylum seekers. 'asylum. Dear Mr. Tusk, I was in the Council press room last week and I went to listen to you at the press conference. I admit that I was flabbergasted to see you blandly assert that the Council would take up the problem in December, with the idea of ​​perhaps reaching a conclusion at the end of the first half of 2018, that is to say - say two years after the proposal made by the Commission and eight months after the agreement obtained here in the European Parliament. Quite frankly, when I hear of \"Leader's Agenda\", I think the terms \"follower's agenda\" would be much more appropriate. I would like to continue by talking about the fight against unbridled tax competition. Here again, while the Commission and Parliament want to move forward, the Council which you preside guarantees a standstill whose only beneficiaries are those who should be the biggest taxpayers - I am obviously thinking of the multinationals and the big fortunes. You will tell me that, on another thorny subject - the issue of posted workers, which has plagued the European debate for years - the Council was able to reach agreement last night. I am delighted, but it is on a text that is much less protective than the one adopted by Parliament under the leadership of Ms. Morin-Chartier and Ms. Jongerius. You can be sure that we will defend tooth and nail our text, which aims first and foremost not to protect the internal market, but to protect workers from exploitation. Mr. Tusk, I see you're interested ... I see you are interested, Mr Tusk, but anyway go ahead, there is no problem. Parliament brings together people from the same countries and from the same political families as the Council. So explain to me how it is possible, in this Parliament, to deal with subjects as complicated as those you are dealing with and to arrive at agreements that are both ambitious and supported by very large majorities, something which often proves difficult, or even impossible in the Council. And I find myself dreaming of heads of state and government determined to rise to the top. Their compass would be the conviction that there is, in the 21st century, only shared sovereignty and that their mission is to protect the well-being of all and not of a minority. Armed with their courage - because after all, it is they who are vested with supreme political authority in each of their countries - they would know, whenever necessary, how to give the necessary impetus to overcome national selfishness and political pettiness. Instead of embodying the force of stagnation, they would be the ones who would push the Commission to show even more speed and ambition to find innovative solutions to the challenges of this century. I am thinking, for example, of the digitization of the economy. How do we avoid creating a “cyberproletariat”? I am obviously thinking of the question of the ecological transition of our societies, which should be the Union's main strategy. It would be the Council that would challenge Parliament to go faster to find an agreement so that we are able to negotiate. So allow me to conclude by quoting a compatriot, Jacques Brel: \"To dream an impossible dream, [...] to attempt, without strength and without armor, to reach the inaccessible star, such is my quest\".

However, the underlying meaning of this progress is plain for all to see. The meaning is that the British Prime Minister is conceding ever more ground to the EU, rather than standing up for that which the people of the UK voted. The people of my nation voted not just to leave the EU 28, but to regain our sovereignty. What Mrs May is doing is quietly surrendering, so that we will end up neither leaving nor sovereign. We will remain subservient to the EU, both financially and legally, a nation condemned to serfdom by its own leaders. For this I do not blame the EU or its negotiators. You are only pursuing your perception of the interests of your project. For this, I condemn the UK Government. By its supine behaviour it has forfeited the trust of the British people, whether they originally voted either to leave or to remain. More than that, it has betrayed those who voted her into power at the last election, this Conservative Party that won the election with the slogan ‘Brexit means Brexit’. The fact this government is slowly backtracking on its commitment to the British people must stick in the craw of those who voted for it. Although the EU is, in the way it is conducting these negotiations, breaking the United Nations Declaration on Principles of International Law, which clearly states that no state may use or encourage the use of economic, political or any other type of measures to coerce another state in order to obtain from it the subordination of the exercise of its sovereign rights and to secure from it advantages of any kind. And indeed its own Treaty commitments to sincere cooperation and the progressive abolition of restrictions on international trade. The fault lies with Her Majesty’s Government for not having the courage of our convictions, and saying ‘enough is enough’. The other side is not seeking negotiation but capitulation, and walking away. Whatever the financial settlement Mrs May finally agrees to pay, whether it is GBP 100 or GBP 100 billion, it will simultaneously be too much and too little: too little for those in the EU who seek to punish us for having the temerity to seek our own path. For those ideologues no punishment is too great for those who seek self-determination. And too much for those of us who wish nothing more than to be good friends, neighbours, allies and partners of those we leave behind.

But it is up to you, Mr Juncker, to prevent free trade treaties from being negotiated on the sly against the vital interests of our peoples, as was the case with CETA. Today, just a few minutes ago, you told us that you wanted to do the same with Mexico or Mercosur, that is to say that you will once again place our agriculture, in particular, in a situation of unfair competition. faced with countries that do not respect any of the rules, neither health, nor social, nor environmental, thus causing the death of whole sections of our economy.

Key sectors, such as road transport, for example, are not even concerned, and you do not question the central aspect of the payment of social contributions in the country of origin, which obviously creates unfair competition, and that the posted worker costs 1.5 times or, sometimes, 2 times less than a local worker.

A decent Africa policy is security policy; A decent social policy - and therefore congratulations on the Posting of Workers Directive and the social pillars - is also security, a feeling of security for the citizen. This is particularly true of advances in security and defense policy. And what we're doing with PESCO is just a lame start, but we should go ahead here. And that's why we should finally not stop at 1% of the budget, but use the full 1.24%, which in principle has already been approved. And I think that we have to make that clearer. But let me make a few comments about Brexit. I would like to thank the Council, and especially the Commission and Michel Barnier, for maintaining the mandate and showing a clear line. If the Tories are having difficulty reaching an agreement that is negotiable, particularly on financial commitments, then this is no reason for us to abandon this clear negotiating mandate in the interests of the European citizens. I think we want to have constructive negotiations. We want to have a decent result, we want to have good relationships in the future in order to keep the damage of Brexit as low as possible. But that seems to be the case that the obligations one has, Mr Kamall, to use as a trade-off for better trade relations to be a somewhat strange entry point for me.We had agreed on the sequences.I think that is why we should move now so that we can come to the decision in December that the second phase should be initiated.And I'm not exactly sure, Mr. Kamall, who is playing Robin Hood on this issue.(The speaker agreed to answer a question on the blue card procedure under Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure.)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "David COBURN", "mepid": "124967", "text": "  blue-card question. – Surely, Mr Brok, it is not a matter of right that the European Union demands this money, it is a matter of necessity.

If we want to have a real reform of the eurozone in order to promote growth and convergence, we need to provide the eurozone with the fiscal capacity to help and support Member States in this direction. If we want to have a real European asylum system, the Council should adopt the recent reform of the Dublin system just adopted by the European Parliament. If we want Europe to promote a better world order, then yes, we need to use trade agreements, but we need to push the Sustainable Development Goals together with these agreements. These are very concrete measures to deliver on the road map with credibility, but the main test will be the next European budget, because all this ambition needs to be matched by a real overhaul of the Community budget in a way that enables us to meet these new priorities.

Nothing really happened that would amount to a breakthrough, Brexit being a case in point. On the other hand, this need not be a bad thing, considering that the hyperactivity of the European institutions usually creates more problems than it solves. On the positive side, immigration seems to be treated with conspicuously more sense than in the past. The President of the Council himself has admitted that mandatory relocation was not a good idea. It took him a lot of time to admit what many governments had said right at the outset. He should have listened to us, not those he usually listens to. There is also the problem of Nord Stream 2, this notorious and politically hostile Russian—German energy enterprise. As might have been expected, the Council failed to give a sufficiently strong signal to the Commission to dump it, the German Government being clearly supportive of Nord Stream. The Commission, which so eagerly roars like a lion when confronted with weaker partners, in cases like Nord Stream seems to behave more like a sheep; pardon the comparison. I conservatively predict that it will continue to do so. Let me now reply to Mr Weber. I want to thank him for pointing out the alleged – I would say – inconsistency in Polish politics and, by way of courtesy, I would like to reciprocate though he is not here. I wonder which is the real thing: what Mr Weber, representing the ruling party in Germany says here, criticising Nord Stream or the German Government policy that relentlessly carries out this impossible and politically dangerous project?

This was very timely, to say the least, not least since the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs adopted, on Thursday, with a very large majority, our position on the necessary reform of the Dublin Regulation. I have managed to gather behind me and to unite this House in a very bold proposal, creating a truly European Asylum System, and we have managed to do so through long negotiations and by listening to each other. Now I think it is high time that you, in Council, do exactly the same: listen to each other and start paying respect to each other, leaving national egoism behind. This belongs to history and not to the current situation in Europe. We can never create a functioning Common European Asylum System as long as every Member State is obsessed with their own national situation. We now need to create a fair system that works for all of Europe, with all its Member States. And such a system has to include automatic relocation of asylum-seekers and must be based on the principle of solidarity, as in Article 80 of our Treaties. The goal has to be to fix the asylum system, not merely to find some watered-down compromise that can reach unanimity in Council. It is high time that you take a qualified majority vote on this, because otherwise we will never change reality. I welcome that Council has signalled that it will continue working on this and set the goal of reaching a mandate before the spring. Negotiations in trilogues will be long and difficult, but I look forward to opening those trilogues sooner rather than later.

La Catalogna non è, come ha detto l'on. Pittella, a frattura, è un impegno di maggior democrazia. Two. The Commission applauds the measures of the Spanish Government to supplant democracy in Catalonia and direct it from Madrid as if Catalonia were a colony. Democracy is supplanted and they applaud, how is it possible? Three. As presidents of the Council, Commission and Parliament, all three have received the Princess of Asturias Award in Spain. After listening to their speeches of thanks, it is understood that they have been awarded the award, but it is not understood that they have given it to concord, what concord? Four. As an MEP, I feel unprotected by the President of my Parliament and I regret that he is not presiding. He, like the King of Spain, has abandoned his role as impartial mediator.

The most desirable public good in contemporary Europe is a sense of security. This is the greatest deficit of our time and the most important field of confrontation with left-wing and right-wing populism that lives by fueling human fears. It is also the best measure of the credibility of European institutions. Reading the conclusions of the last Council in this regard, one can be moderately optimistic, because the chaos of 2015 in 2017 is turning into migration management. Instead of treating symptoms under the pressure of time and events, there is prevention, reaching the root of the problem, guessing new threats, and not just automatic relocation, which in my opinion has no great future in the European Union. I am pleased that the European Parliament is involved in making a good contribution to the reform of asylum law. Now a few words about the Leaders' Agenda in the aspect that interests me most, namely the future of the EU budget. It is not hard to see that the Leaders' Agenda calendar does not exactly match the State of the Union address and the resolution that Parliament will adopt today, which expresses the desire to complete negotiations and reach an agreement for the post-2020 period ahead of the 2019 European elections. these conversations, sharing our doubts and remembering that it has taken us two and a half years recently.

Instead of doing too little or nothing, we could be working on a radical reform of the European asylum system. We adopted a good proposal in Parliament last week, according to which the burden will no longer be on the country of entry alone. We agreed on the need for a permanent and automatic mechanism for the transfer of people, in which all Member States will participate. We now also expect this agreement from European governments.

I think it is time that we also criticised the negotiation strategy of the Commission and the Council. It is illogical, it is dangerous, and I think it is unfair. It is illogical because the EU insists on a financial offer by the British Government before any agreement on trade. I just wonder, Mr Juncker, would you ever agree on a price for something when you do not know what you are buying.  It is dangerous because everybody here agrees that peace in Ireland must be preserved at all costs. Nowhere in the world is there a border arrangement without a trade or customs arrangement. How will you ever get such an agreement without negotiations on trade? Finally, it is grossly unfair. Mr Tusk, you have mentioned European values many times. Let me remind you of the fact that democracy, freedom of the press and human rights are not European values; they are universal values.

Strengthening the resources of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency is also fundamental in order to continue to better protect our borders.

Until recently, the logic of national sovereignty prevailed over the logic of integration in the defence field, but in the current circumstances the EU can no longer afford this. Now that all the necessary work has been done to prepare the framework for PESCO, it is time for the Member States to take the final step and notify their readiness to take part in permanent structured cooperation.

Thanks for your schedule, Mr. Tusk. Europe has been built from politics and ambition, and only with politics and ambition can we have a secure future. Sixty years after the signing of the Treaties of Rome, we Europeans are still different, but now we are the same. We have learned to live and coexist under the same laws, with the same rights and even with the same currency. We have learned to call ourselves citizens rather than enemies; we have learned to listen to each other rather than to accuse ourselves and we have learned to build bridges instead of building walls. Nothing happens because we recognize that we have done well. However, today - and this is politics as it was a hundred years ago - we have to face the specter of popular nationalism, which poisons everything, as is happening today in my country, Spain. Today, as a hundred years ago, there are foolish politicians capable of putting their citizens at risk for sovereignty and ethnic supremacy. Today, as a hundred years ago, we hear again about new frontiers, new cultural segregations and new linguistic divisions. Of new nations. That is why today, as in 56, we must remember that the prosperity and well-being of Europe depend on peace and security, but that there can be no peace or security without laws and the rule of law; that democracy is only true when all citizens can vote and that institutions, however legitimate they may be, are not an end in themselves: they are there to serve citizens. Democrats fight for the Europe of integration and the euro; of the Erasmus program; that of the Schengen area; that of the twenty-four languages ​​of this Parliament and the one that leads social spending in the world. Since the human being has existed, no one has had the quality of life that Europeans in the 21st century enjoy.

Anyone who now says that there must be no special provisions for the North of Ireland in any Brexit deal is not only ignoring the realities of the Good Friday Agreement, but is in fact trying to undermine it.

We must find a way to reach the results that will be visible and that will allow people to understand the benefits of the European Union. Lastly, let me also mention two words whose results are more difficult to grasp. These are pragmatism and unanimity, also used by the Chairs of our groups. Concerning pragmatism, let me say that sometimes it is a good thing, but I don’t think that it is good for the sake of so-called pragmatism to obey the rules, the principles and common sense.

It is fair that those countries that want more integration in a certain area should have this opportunity to do so, and those that do not want not to stop the countries that have the opportunity or want to move forward in a certain area. Europe at different speeds, only when they are voluntary, and any country that has met the relevant criteria can become part of the relevant integration step, be it Schengen, the Eurozone, the Prosecutor General's Office, be it the Defense Union, the Banking Union, just to name a few from them. Bulgaria and Romania must be admitted to the Schengen area, and this will increase our common security, not reduce it, as such rumors are heard somewhere. I called not only here, but also for the new government in the Netherlands to take the appropriate step, both by water and by air, in 2018 for Bulgaria and Romania to be part of this space.

This gives us a clue as to why progress is so minimal in the negotiations: the divisions within the governing Conservative Party. Theresa May spends more time negotiating with her party than negotiating with the European Union. And some of her party actually want Brexit without a deal. They present this as a negotiating tactic. If Britain threatens to leave without a deal the EU will give us what we want. Yet, as everybody knows, this will be hugely economically damaging to Britain. That tactic amounts to holding a gun to your own head and saying, give me what I want or I will shoot myself. It will not work. But they do not actually want it to work. Those people want a Brexit without a deal because they want to create maximum distance between Britain and its neighbouring countries.

And so we need to talk about how we can work together to strengthen the institutions so that we can live up to our democratic obligations. The question of the Africa Fund, the question of external border protection, the question of migration policy are also related to the fact that they are primarily national competence, but we have a common European problem.

I therefore look forward to discussing the topics you have announced: the euro area, migration and asylum change, which we have adopted here in our Parliament, a new asylum policy.

And, Mr Tusk, I think we need to see that these states, which are discriminated against, are at the top of the list of pro-European countries, and it is good to take that into account. We must respect pro-European citizens and fight Euroscepticism. That is why I believe, Mr Tusk, that it is important to have unity in the Council and not to tell us what we need to do. Don't give us advice. Regarding the number of mandates, of course, it was said here, it is the Parliament that will decide, but, this time, I agree. A state is leaving, we need to reduce the number of parliamentarians.

That is our mission. If we are to be successful in our mission we, the three institutions represented here today, need to act collectively. If we are successful in providing answers that work for our citizens, Europe will be rewarded for it. If we are not successful in providing these answers we will all share the blame. The blame-game here – saying ‘Parliament did the right thing’, ‘the Commission did the right thing’, or ‘the Commission failed’, ‘Parliament failed’ or ‘the Council failed’ – is useless because our citizens do not distinguish between our institutions. They will say that Europe has failed. So, in that sense, we are in this together. Two of the institutions now represented here today only have limited time left before the next elections and before the next Commission will come in. We need to make the best use possible of that limited time.

The leaders’ agenda is not an alternative version of the State of the Union address. It is a plan on how to organise the work of the European Council in the next two years. The leaders’ agenda is not about changing the Community method. It is an attempt to speed up decision-making processes under binding rules while respecting the competences of all institutions, and that includes the competences of the European Council.  According to the Treaty, when it comes to the composition of the European Parliament, we – this House and the European Council – must work out a common solution. It is not our pleasure or ambition, but our formal obligation. I am the last one to want to violate the Treaty and our rules. By the way, the composition of the European Parliament will not be the only topic for the extraordinary European Council in February. We will also deal with the MFF. I personally consider the MFF to be an even more important part of our meeting in February.  As for the Spitzenkandidaten, the European Council was not the weak link in 2014. Jean—Claude Juncker was elected by 26 to 2 votes in the European Council, whereas in Parliament he got 422 out of 729 votes.

(Applause) She was a brave woman, a great journalist. She interpreted the essence of this profession: to investigate to discover the truth about the facts, without being afraid of anyone, and she was not afraid to do her duty to the end, with consistency. In thirty years of career she has never lost heart, she has continued to shed light on her opacity, going straight, answering only to her readers, the only ones to whom she felt she had to be accountable for her. . In this spirit you have published more than twenty thousand articles, denouncing abuses of power, corruption and bad governance. Like any true journalist, she was the sentinel, the soldier on the front line in the defense of our values. It is only thanks to a free and independent press that we can have and defend democracy, the rule of law, freedom of expression and all the fundamental rights on which the European construction and our own civilization rests. Our Union is much more than a market, a currency or a bank. It is the reflection of these values, of our identity, with the dignity and freedom of the person at the center. To defend it every day, inside and outside the Union, we must affirm the independence of the press. I am proud of this Parliament, which has always taken a strong stand on this front. Daphne's murder must not go unpunished. With what credibility could we continue to defend the world's journalists if we fail to give them protection and justice in our own home? I expect the Maltese authorities to make every effort to shed light on this matter. Every lead must be followed, and I believe it is also necessary to involve Europol in the framework of an international investigation where all the police forces can make their contribution to having the guilty arrested and sentenced. (Applause) This is it international involvement that I solicited during the last meeting of the heads of state and government of the European Union. The example that Daphne has given us must not be forgotten. This is why the Bureau decided last night to name the press room of the European Parliament here in Strasbourg after Daphne Caruana Galizia. (Applause) We have her family here in the stands. I want to express our closeness to her husband, her three children and her daughter-in-law, together with that of thousands of Maltese who took to the streets on Sunday to ask for justice and remember her commitment. Alongside these Maltese there are half a billion European citizens. (Parliament, standing, applauds the family of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia) This applause, dear family of Daphne, represents a very clear message: the European Parliament will not stop dealing with the murder of his wife, your mother, his mother-in-law until the truth is found out. We will not remain silent until the instigators and murderers of this murder are discovered. I now ask all of you to stand up as a sign of respect for this woman and to gather us in a minute of silence in memory of Daphne Caruana Galizia.

The Youth Guarantee is one of the European Union's most important programs for creating job vacancies, a program which, however, often works better in theory than in practice. I voted in favor of this report because the implementation of the Youth Guarantee must be improved through strategic choices, aimed above all at the good use of funds. The data, in fact, show us that internships in companies, even if formative, almost never create real employment, because at the end of the fixed period the companies do not hire young people. Instead, programs on self-employment are effective, just to give an example, on start-ups.

Another solution that I think would lead to a decrease in youth unemployment is admission to vocational schools or colleges - so specialization - based on criteria of merit, ability, dedication, talent, because we are different and we can not do all the same things. Some are good at medicine, others are good at being engineers, others have talent at being teachers and dedication at being teachers, and that way when you finish college, you definitely get a job because you go to an interview. where it shows that you are talented and want that job.

The minimum income is a tool to fight against poverty and build more just and egalitarian societies, but also a tool that benefits society as a whole. For the economy to work, people have to be able to consume: it's that simple. The wheel has to turn or it will stop for everyone.

The Work Programme is the Commission’s commitment to you, and to Europeans, about what we will do in the coming year. It is a crucial period because together we have just over 18 months to show results before our citizens go to the ballot box to re-elect this House. There are no surprises in what we announce today. The Work Programme reflects fully the ambition, content and tone of Jean-Claude Juncker’s State of the Union speech and the letter of intent we sent you in parallel. At the same time, our Work Programme has certainly been enriched by, and builds on, the fruitful exchanges we have had in this Chamber with the Conference of Committee Chairs and the Conference of Presidents, as well as on our exchanges with the Member States in line with the Interinstitutional Agreement on Better Law—Making. We have also discussed with the Council and have had contributions from the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions. I would like to thank you for the excellent cooperation we have had and continue to enjoy. We need to build on this in the decisive months to come. I think we have now established, after three years, quite a routine in doing this and it is working well. The Work Programme sets out an agenda for a more united, stronger and more democratic Europe. It has a twofold focus. First, we set out a limited number of new proposals, which we will deliver by May 2018 so that the legislative work here and in the Council can be finished before the elections. The Commission has already tabled more than 80% of the proposals needed under the 10 priorities set out by President Juncker in 2014. Now we will focus on getting the remaining proposals on the table and working with you and the Council to see them adopted. Our focus is on the limited number of proposals needed to complete the strategies we have set out. To boost jobs, growth and investment, we will pursue work to deliver on the circular economy action plan and to complete the digital single market, the energy union, the capital markets union and the banking union. We will propose the creation of a dedicated euro area budget line within the EU budget, along with other measures to complete the economic and monetary union, including transforming the European Stability Mechanism into a European Monetary Fund.  To create a deeper and fairer internal market with a strengthened industrial base, we will present an initiative on fair taxation in the digital economy and a proposal to improve the EU food supply chain. We are – like you – looking forward to the proclamation of the European pillar of social rights next month.  We will follow up with a social fairness package that creates a European labour authority to help address labour mobility and social security challenges. We will improve the rules requiring employees to be properly informed about their contracts and will present an initiative on access to social protection so that everyone who works, whether in traditional or new jobs in the gig economy, can contribute and have access to social protection.  We will also table targeted new measures to complete the security union, in particular as concerns the fight against terrorism and ensuring the interoperability of stronger and smarter databases for our border migration and security needs. We will strengthen the Union’s Civil Protection Mechanism so that we are better prepared to help in situations such as the tragic and devastating forest fires we have seen recently in Portugal and Spain. We will continue to work on our comprehensive approach to migration with an emphasis on returns, protecting our external borders, solidarity with Africa, opening legal pathways and, above all, agreeing on Dublin reform and the Blue Card proposal. We will set out our ideas about how to modernise our visa policy. We will keep up the focus on migration management in our relations with third countries and we will deliver on the global strategy, whilst also pursuing a balanced and progressive trade policy to harness globalisation. The second focus of our Work Programme is more forward-looking and aims to shape the Union until 2025. This vision is based on three principles which must always anchor our Union: freedom, equality and the rule of law. A more united Union will require opening the Schengen Area fully to Romania and Bulgaria, as well as a credible enlargement perspective for front-runner candidates in the Western Balkans. By the way, the Schengen area should also be opened to Croatia if it can fulfil the requirements. To build a stronger Union, we will table a proposal for the future multiannual financial framework, including own resources. We need a budget that helps us to meet citizens’ expectations of an EU that delivers on the things that matter most and that contributes to the long-term sustainability of the Union. We will also propose more efficient decision—making for the single market and certain foreign policy decisions. We will adopt a reflection paper on a sustainable European future and a communication on the future of EU energy and climate policy and propose an extension of the tasks of the European Public Prosecutor’s Office to also tackle terrorism.  For a more democratic Union, we will make proposals for the creation of a permanent and accountable European Minister of Economy and Finance and an initiative on further enhancing subsidiarity, proportionality and better regulation in the daily work of the European Union. We will also propose an initiative on strengthening the enforcement of the rule of law.  Furthermore, since what matters is results on the ground, the Work Programme sets out the Commission’s commitment to step up its work on the enforcement of EU law, working closely with national authorities and the various European networks. In parallel with our Work Programme, we are also presenting today a communication on completing the Better Regulation Agenda. Our work here is grounded on strong stakeholder involvement, including the input of the REFIT Platform. Given the forthcoming European Parliament elections, we are now firmly in a period where we need to deliver. Priority legislative files need to be adopted and, where possible, implemented before the end of Parliament’s mandate. The Joint Declaration on EU legislative priorities, signed by the Presidents of the three institutions last December, has proved valuable in helping us to find shared priorities and stick to them. The Commission looks forward to an agreement later this year on the new Joint Declaration shaping our common work for 2018 and we can then also take stock of what we did on the basis of the Declaration of 2017.  We need to use the current momentum to ensure real progress in order to finish what we have started and to deliver on our positive agenda because, when you rise for elections in a year and a half’s time, the success of the EU will not be judged on the number of proposals that the Commission has launched. We will be judged collectively on the answers we have delivered and how we have responded to the big challenges like climate change, globalisation, the security of our citizens, migration, jobs and growth, on which Europeans expect effective European solutions.

I am saying this because I am sure that some of our other colleagues will tell you that we do not do anything about this, except what you have said, but I think it is much worse if you know it from secondary and later sources, and we will definitely be able to learn about the details later on. However, on the general lines, I think it is very important in this last point to make some of the points of procedure clear.  This year, Parliament failed to adopt a joint declaration on the Commission Work Programme, so you had to do it without Parliament’s help, in a way. Next year – because it is close to the election year – and the year after there is no need, according to the interinstitutional agreement, to have such a resolution. I think it is a very difficult and tiresome exercise, but we should use these two or three years to rethink what is the best way. Would it be best to influence Commission decisions and to have a general resolution on the whole thing every year with tiresome negotiations and with no consequences? It depends on us (I am saying this to the colleagues here), but we can also maybe find other, more flexible ways to influence this. The EPP welcomed the Commission’s proposal that less and better regulation is better for the legislation than in previous years, and I appreciate the discipline which the Commission brought to this process by really restraining itself. Having this figure which you mentioned – 80% – is really remarkable. Never before has the Commission, with such a high level of complacency, already reached the level of the programme which they were putting forward at the beginning of the term. That also goes to show that there is a clear attempt – albeit not always successful – to concentrate on the most important things. On behalf of the EPP, we agree on the content in most cases, especially in the area of jobs: that we still have to deliver to enable companies to compete in domestic and global markets. In the area of migration, we are still in the midst of negotiations and resolutions here in Parliament. But to concentrate on fighting the root causes of migration and to use the private sector in the financing of this kind of migration crisis is key in achieving development objectives, as is much closer cooperation with the neighbourhood. In the area of longer-term goals, the debate on the future of the European Union has started. It was launched by the Commission, and I would like to thank them for that.

We all know that this is the last shot for this European Commission, and let me be precise on what our demands are: to have real, fair and credible solutions. Yes, we do need a European Social Pillar, but let me be precise: the pillar needs to be translated in outstanding measures, notably making sure that everybody in employment – in whatever kind of job – can count on a decent labour contract and on full access to social protection.  When it comes to the reform of the eurozone, we need a eurozone not only with stability, but with roles and conversions – this means having a European semester working in this direction, a fiscal capacity supporting investment and supporting upward conversions, and a Minister of Economy and Finance who should be accountable to this European Parliament.  On migration, the long—term crisis in front of us and behind us can only be responded to via the proper reform of the European asylum system, legal corridors for legal migration, and a much stronger partnership with Africa. We also know that when it comes to the role of Europe in supporting the multilateral system and an open world order, a lot depends on the kind of trade agreements we are able to do. The kind of trade agreements that we are pushing for are those which should be inspired by sustainable development goals, and all these must be translated into to the European budget.

On migration, we finally expect action from Commissioner Mogherini in connection with the conclusion of the readmission agreements, which have been talked about for a long time. When it comes to security, we need more European cooperation. I am thinking of tackling cybercrime. After all, half of crimes today are cyber crimes and this is a major concern for many Europeans. In addition, we need to cooperate more closely on defense. The industrial development program for European defense is a good example of this. In terms of jobs, there are still many opportunities in the further development of the digital internal market. Here we await, among other things, the proposals from the Commission on the business-to-business platform and for further cooperation from the Commission in the completion of the dossiers on geo-blocking and online sales. I also hope that the Commission will make more money available for European research in the proposals for the new multiannual financial framework.

I have only just received the text, so I have not been able to read all the details yet, but I am going to say something which may shock you. Indeed, I intend to praise you for what you have just said – yes, I know you are going to need months of therapy to get over it. Nevertheless, we do seem to be past the stage of thinking that delivering results lies in scrapping red tape. What you have just told us here sounds like a vision for the future, and, unlike some other people, I do not believe that you need to see an eye doctor if you have vision. On migration, the Commission has done what it needs to do. Parliament has done its homework. It is actually those who are absent who have not done their homework. As we said this morning, migration is more than Fortress Europe, for the question is not only how we keep people out, but also how we are going to process people, the rapid inflows of migrants. I am very, very pleased to hear that you are going to work on a mechanism for the enforcement of the rule of law: that is, of course, most welcome, but in the short term there are also things that we need to do. For example, I would be really, really pleased if the Commission were to reinstate the corruption reports: we have just seen last week in Malta what corruption and in particular those who are investigating corruption can do. We urgently need a strong tool for investigating corruption and also the rule of law – in Poland, for example. What does it mean if the Commission has more or less concluded that the judiciary in Poland is no longer independent? What does that mean for cooperation? What about the European arrest warrant, ECRIS, the Schengen Information System – are we going to use Polish material? What are we going to do?

A few others we might not like so much, but that’s life! I still want to point out some of the areas where we think that we absolutely need more progress and some of them have already been mentioned by colleagues.  Number one: the rule of law. We have a dramatic situation in a couple of Member States. I think we all agree that we need to stand firm and that we need to be coherent in what we are doing if we want to achieve a good result and we should never let go, we should never give up on such a fundamental thing as making sure that the safeguards against arbitrary leadership, and even despotism, are not endangered in Europe, and this goes to the very heart of the European project.  In Parliament we are currently working towards asking for Article 7.1 to be triggered against Hungary and I think that the Commission must do the same now also with regard to Poland. So you will come to the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – we are looking forward to your report – but we need to get active on that as well. As has been mentioned, I am glad that you are also taking that up, to look too into other measures, measures that have been proposed by Parliament in the past and which are more sophisticated, more varied as well, and I think we need to go ahead with that to make sure that we are firm and strong on our European core principles and values.  I also would like to mention the whole issue of sexual harassment because no woman should ever have to put up with such treatment – not on the street, not at work and not in this House or in any European institution. I really would like to applaud all of the women who in the past weeks have taken the courageous step – because it is an incredibly courageous step – to go out and say ‘this is what happened to me’. We must make sure that it is not just a matter of individual courage but that we actually also do something against sexual harassment.  I would also say generally about sexism because sexism is what enables sexual harassment in the end, and there we really need to do more. We need to do more, we can do more as the European Union. I would like to see this play a part in the Work Programme too, that there will be initiatives, because I think we should not just have a debate and then say ‘okay, well, next time we will have another debate’, but we should really get serious about this and say we do not accept it any longer.  Next on social justice, and colleagues have also mentioned that. I think social justice is absolutely key if we want to take the European Union further and I think most of us here want that. We want to protect European citizens but that also means social protection. To have a proclamation on the European Pillar on Social Rights, as is envisaged, is absolutely great and fantastic but proclamations alone are simply not enough.  I think, for example, that the Commission should propose a framework directive on an adequate minimum income for all Europeans or different minimum incomes. We Greens have also proposed an EU sustainability and prosperity pact for the European Monetary Union (EMU) and the EMU must go hand in hand with a binding roadmap for social, economic and environmental convergence. I think the issue of tax justice also forms part of the whole social justice package; the income part, so to say. All companies must contribute their fair share to welfare in the European Union and therefore we also need to look at minimum tax for companies and common tax instruments because tax fraud and evasion must be fought with all consequence.  Lastly, on climate change, we do need much more effort. If we want to reach our targets then we have to get serious. We have to adjust our targets upwards and that is, I think, what we need to do because, as you rightly said, this is the last year before the European elections. We want people to vote and we want them to know why we make a difference.

What is our experience? In the past period, we have seen that they arrived too late to actually start at the beginning of 2014, 2015 and 2016. For example, in a number of areas, such as cohesion policy and the second pillar of agriculture, this has meant that expenditure has only started very late. That should be better now. That must now be faster. This can also be done if the regulations are presented in one go, mid-2018. If we don't, then we get a repeat of what we have seen, which is that expenses are made very late in the period, in the 5 or 7 years. We saw last time there was a great pile of unpaid bills. We can already see that EUR 8 billion will be returned to the Member States in 2016. This will also partly happen this year and we will have a tremendous avalanche of bills, later in 2019 and 2020. And then not talking about Brexit. So indeed, better regulation and also timely regulation to be able to show in 2019 that Parliament is really taking that direction. It cannot be the case that in mid-2019 we will get together in a situation of debates that have not been concluded and that 2020 and 2021 will be bad years.

I therefore welcome the initiative on taxation of the digital sector, but I think we have to do much more. I have spent the last few years working as a co-rapporteur for the Parliament’s inquiry committee into the Panama Papers. Our investigations show how unregulated intermediaries in Europe and in offshore tax havens help the super-rich hide their wealth in tax havens. We have to stop this shadowy industry of tax dodging, and also stop the corrupt global elite that are doing this. That is why we, the Socialists and Democrats, want to break new ground to put an effective end to tax fraud, money laundering and tax havens by introducing a common EU licence for wealth managers, tax advisers and other intermediaries, so that licences can be instantly revoked throughout the EU in the event of illegal actions. Only a common system with EU licences will make sure that we can put an effective stop to the industry of tax fraud in Europe.

But also, among other things, the \"mobility and climate change\" package was proposed, which is necessary but also raises a lot of controversy, as future emissions regulations should be correlated with a long-term vision of transforming the car sector towards zero emissions. Here, we need a certain roadmap to electromobility, which is important, necessary and future-proof. However, it must also take into account the development of the domestic European car industry - in my country there are over two hundred thousand jobs and they would like to know what this transformation project should look like. And perhaps a small matter: it is a question of the 2001 Parliament and Council directive on summer time. In my country, for example, there is a discussion, and there is great approval for approaching the abandonment of this annual double clock shift. It is not only a matter for my country but also, for example, of many other European countries that are raising legitimacy.

First of all, I sense that we share a sense of urgency – that we understand that the challenges Europe faces are daunting – and I also see that the vast majority of this Parliament wants to act, and wants us to try and help our citizens regain control over their destinies with measures at a European level that can no longer be taken only at the national level. There is a part of this Parliament that believes in fleeing in a form of nostalgic nationalism, talking people down all the time as though we are on the brink of extinction; as though everything is going wrong, etc. Yes, the challenges are daunting. Yes, we are coming out of a deep economic crisis that has increased disparities in Europe, and that has not led to the convergence we want. But we do have a new sense of shared destiny, which was expressed also in the European Council.  But one thing that perhaps did not get enough attention in that European Council is that if you want that sense of purpose to be translated into concrete measures, you need the co-legislators. You need someone to make a proposal, and you need Council and Parliament jointly to take a decision so that you can implement it. And that is why the Commission Work Programme is not just a bureaucratic exercise; it is a concrete translation of the ambitions that are formulated in this House, in the European Council, and in the Commission. I believe speeches will not solve problems; even the most brilliant speech does not solve a problem. Concrete steps forward on social policy, on the digital single market, on completing the internal market and the banking union, on making sure that the very fundamental issue of the rule of law is something we strengthen in Europe and do not weaken in Europe, and on the fact that we need to deliver concrete results – and we do not have much time left until the next election – that is what we have reflected in the Commission Work Programme.  Yes, there are disagreements amongst us, but this is the Commission’s proposal, and we will look for a majority in this Parliament in a debate. That is how democracy works. I even heard somebody say that the only legitimate democracies are at the national level. What nonsense: every single Member of this House has been elected directly by European citizens and therefore has a mandate to decide with the Council on legislation that affects every single European citizen, and I think we need to understand this responsibility we have. We need to be able to face our voters in 2019 with something we have accomplished and with a plan for the future, and for those of you who have raised the issue of governance in the economic and monetary union, saying that this cannot be a bureaucratic process: that is exactly why the Commission has made this proposal. This should be discussed and mandated in this Parliament if we take these major decisions.  So that is the gist of our proposal for next year, and let me end on one thing: I believe it is also a matter of honour that we acknowledge that some of the problems we face are very, very complicated to solve, but we will not let them go. I refer to what the honourable Member Mr Marias has said: the situation on the Greek islands is still unacceptable, completely unacceptable, and this Commission will never let go of its responsibility to make sure that we solve it. And I do agree with those of you who have said that this requires pan-European solidarity by all Member States. I believe we are in our full right to demand this responsibility in Member States. And responsibility also means that we adhere to the truth, that we do not tell fairy tales about a secret plan to ‘Brusselise’ – or whatever they call it – European populations, or about a secret plan to force people to take migrants. This is not the case.  The only plan we have is to provide European citizens with the tools so that they can shape their futures and their destinies on the basis of their values, and we need to do this collectively. Globalisation will not go away if we take refuge in nation states only. Globalisation can only be harnessed if we as Europeans, act together with a common sense of purpose.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 176, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "The debate is closed.Written statements (Rule 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 177, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Vilija BLINKEVIČIŪTĖ", "mepid": "96681", "text": "in writing. - Vice-President of the European Commission, presenting the 2018 The Commission's work program noted that the Commission intends to present next year a social justice package, which will include a proposal to set up a European labor force to address labor mobility and social protection issues.

In this part, I assess the program as not ambitious enough. In the European Parliament, I am pleased with the trend that more and more MEPs are realizing that demographic change and the rights of older people in Europe are an area that will be one of the biggest challenges for the Member States and the European Union. Unfortunately, this trend is not seen in the European Commission's 2018 program. The rights of the elderly are about dignity and basic human rights, which are universal or, if you will, European. Therefore, the principle of subsidiarity cannot be a reason for not doing what EU citizens expect in this area at European Union level.

The position of the European Parliament on the 2018 budget of the European Union which we are going to vote on tomorrow proposes to you a realistic and honest budget of the European Union. We propose a budget which is innovative, which is future oriented and which enables the European Union to provide the prospect of prosperity and safety for its citizens.  The priorities of the budget for next year in the eyes of Parliament should be firstly growth and jobs, and secondly, the safety, the security of citizens. We want to achieve this by investing in research and innovation, infrastructure, small and medium-sized enterprises, the Erasmus programme; we want to strengthen measures on combating youth unemployment, we want to stand by the side of young farmers. In order to provide for more security, we want to strengthen the agencies of the Union which have responsibility for justice and home affairs, these being: the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL), Eurojust, the European Asylum Support Office (EASO), Frontex, Europol.  We want to do more in terms of defence at European level because it makes much more sense to spend money once at European level for defence and then share the benefits of our work, of our cooperation, amongst 28 Member States, many of us being also in NATO and NATO saying it is good that the European Union does more on defence together, that Member States of the Union are also cooperating together. This is a new task for the Union. It is a future-oriented task.  Commissioner, I believe that the draft budget which you presented at the end of May is a very good starting point for the upcoming negotiations between Council and Parliament that will start tomorrow with our vote and which will go on for 21 days. The draft budget is a very good starting point because the Commission is the institution best placed to evaluate the implementation of projects and the real needs on the ground. Beyond this draft budget, in order to achieve the priorities of Parliament which I have just outlined, the European Parliament proposes to increase financing by EUR 22.5 million for COSME. This is the programme which is financing small and medium-sized enterprises. It is there that the job creation process is taking place.  We propose to finance the European Research Council by EUR 15 million more; the SME instrument by EUR 10 million more because there is a very high demand, it has a very good implementation rate; the Marie Curie Excellency Research Programme, because there are many good research projects applying, by EUR 10 million; and EUR 32 million for Erasmus. As we know, 80% of research and innovation programmes under Horizon 2020 would not take place unless they were financed at European level, so there is a clear added value there. In terms of strengthening the agencies of the Union we want EUR 10 million for Europol, EUR 26 million for EASO and EUR 3 million each for Eurojust and CEPOL.  In terms of external relations, because it is in the fundamental interest of the Union to be surrounded by safe countries, we believe we have to allocate our resources primarily to the immediate neighbourhood. It is there that the big risk for the Union is coming from. So we propose to use the resources existing in the budget to finance the southern Mediterranean appropriately and to increase funding there by EUR 120 million. We propose EUR 27 million more for the Eastern Neighbourhood and EUR 35 million more for the Western Balkans.  When it comes to our relations with our partner Turkey, with which we have jointly managed to overcome the migration and refugee crisis, I want to say the following very briefly: as long as Turkey is drifting apart from European standards, we should make sure that particularly the pre-accession funds targeted at supporting political reforms in Turkey should be reduced because, in terms of political reforms, Turkey is moving for the time being into a direction which is completely opposite to European standards.  I am looking forward to the debate, and to the upcoming negotiation with the Council and the Commission in the coming three weeks.

I also want to record my thanks to the shadow rapporteurs for their continued support throughout the process. Members will recall that, in April this year, this House agreed to increase the European Parliament budget for next year by 2.3%. Bearing in mind the effect of inflation and the cyclical cost of preparations for the 2019 elections, I thought 2.3% was reasonable and responsible. It has therefore been my intention that an increase of 2.3% be taken as the benchmark against which all other institutions would be measured, and the level be the target for the overall budget increase. I was particularly pleased to note that the Council followed our lead when they too set their budget at an increase of just below 2.3%.  However, it has not been possible or indeed desirable to peg all individual institution budgets at that level. I have had to take into account a number of exceptional cost demands for 2018. First, the Court of Justice and the Court of Auditors. Both have significantly increased workloads, as well as a number of significant security issues which will have to be addressed. Second, the Data Protection Supervisor. He has been tasked with a new role for which we will have to make provision. Thirdly, the question of strategic communications. I am aware that many in this House consider this to be a key priority, and I know that this view is shared by a number of the Member States. So, to meet that expectation, we shall have to oppose the cuts which are currently proposed by Council when it comes to the coming negotiations. Finally, the EU Special Representative. Both Parliament and the EEAS have been pressing for some time to transfer the cost of special representatives over to the EEAS budget. Clearly, this would be budget-neutral, and so in our proposals Parliament has indicated that it is willing to make provision to cover this transfer in the 2018 budget.  I recommend to Parliament that these cost increases are both reasonable and justifiable, but I would, however, wish to remind Members of the importance of exercising fiscal discipline in order to keep public expenditure under control. To that end, I have identified a number of areas where cost savings could be made. Specifically, I would give the example that I propose a freeze on the budgets of the Committee of Regions and the Economic and Social Committee, and while I am grateful to those groups who have supported this initiative, I am disappointed that the larger groups were not prepared to do so.  Colleagues, in voting on this budget and resolution, this House will set the mandate for the forthcoming negotiation with the Council. I look forward to that negotiation and I look forward to reporting a favourable outcome in November.

I wish to reiterate the same main points I made at the time: that the Council will continue to prioritise the highest European added value points in its 2018 budget proposal, as it has already been doing. And we intend to do that during those three weeks that, Mr Mureşan has already highlighted, stand ahead of us. We stand to stimulate jobs and growth, bolster security and work with migration. At the same time, as you have noticed, the Council has expressed a clear determination to see sufficient margins in the 2018 budget, as this is only prudent. In its deliberations, the Council has scrutinised the implementation capacity extremely carefully to ensure the realistic and efficient use of EU citizens’ funds. Consequently, after the Council adjustments none of the priority areas will see a drop in funding relative to the 2017 budget. I will take, and I have taken, due note of various amendments to Council positions that Parliament has discussed and will discuss. Allow me to make a few very brief remarks in this connection. We are extremely pleased to see that the financial gap between the Council position and Parliament’s position is lower than in many previous years. The Council is, however, extremely concerned about significant increases to certain appropriations proposed by the European Parliament that go beyond the ceiling fixed in the Multiannual Financial Framework. Second, the alarmingly high rate of under-implementation of the Union’s budget, as confirmed by the last amending budget of 2017, and the payments forecast for the next year, as recently published by the Commission, argue for taking a very frugal approach in order to preserve the credibility of both the budget process and the participating institutions. That said, our course of action over the coming weeks has been set out in order to reach a balanced and satisfactory agreement on the 2018 budget. The Council is set to keep to the schedule agreed between our institutions on budget negotiations and to reach an agreement within the deadlines laid down in the Treaty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 189, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Richard ASHWORTH", "mepid": "28132", "text": "Member of the Commission. - Mr President, dear Minister Kivine, dear rapporteurs Mureşan and Ashworth, honorable Members, ladies and gentlemen! I would like to express my appreciation to the two rapporteurs for the quality of their preparatory work. You have achieved a broad position in Parliament to an impressive extent. Thank you also for the changes you are proposing, because your changes could avoid cuts in the Commission's draft, and in some areas they even go beyond the budget proposed by the Commission. I believe we have all set ourselves two priorities with this 2018 budget, which will perhaps be the last normal budget that has not yet been touched in any way by Brexit: growth and employment - we should do everything we can to ensure that the delicate ones Plant growth in most European regions and more jobs in many regions - and, secondly, to successfully tackle the issue of migration and external and internal security at European level. If you take the differences between Council, Parliament and the approach of the Commission, an agreement on a 2018 budget in the Conciliation Committee should actually be possible within the next three weeks, given the goodwill of all parties involved. In some programs, Parliament and the Council have different ideas about the financial needs. On the one hand on the subject of competitiveness and research, on the other hand on the employment initiative for young people and on the third on the subject of European external aid. The higher approaches of the parliament are understandable for us. Nevertheless, we want to mention here that there are agreements between the Council and Parliament, especially with the mid-term review, which should not be abandoned in the 2018 budget either. The top-ups: first, competitiveness. Parliament presents an increase of EUR 1.4 billion in heading 1A for the competitiveness programs. We strongly support this because we can demonstrate in the budget implementation of the last few years that, for example, Horizon 2020 or the Connecting Europe Facility are highly efficient investment programs with which we can demonstrate added value at European level in the interests of the Member States, our economy and our people. That is why I am expressly interested in this increase. You want to secure and increase the necessary funds for growth and employment programs. This is also to be welcomed. We should still think of previous agreements here and stick to them. The measures to support young people: For all of us, the further reduction of the excessive youth unemployment that has started in most regions remains a key objective. That is why we decided in the mid-term review to extend the employment initiative and to increase the funds in 2017–2020 by a total of EUR 1.2 billion. We should examine further means in the next few days, based on the existing unemployment rate and the absorption capacity in the member states to use and implement the money sensibly. In the case of the European Solidarity Corps, Parliament is proposing not to enter any funds at the moment. We respect this, as the legislative process is not there yet and so we have to wait and see. In any case, we should do everything we can to ensure that there is no interruption in the start-up phase of our European Solidarity Corps, and so that young volunteers who have registered and who want to take part can redeem and realize their willingness to volunteer without interruption. External Aid of the European Union, Heading IV - Europe in the World, Global Europe: Here we go into the causes of flight and migration at. Here, too, the increases are understandable. At the same time, you propose certain moderate cuts in the pre-accession program and pre-accession aid for Turkey. I can understand that politically. It is very important to me that we remain able to act on the subject of the Turkey-EU agreement. You will have read that six Member States - Austria, Denmark, Finland, France, Sweden and Germany - have now asked us to allow the EU-Turkey refugee agreement to continue. I can tell you that the three billion that have been made available to us through reallocation in the European budget and through fresh funds from the Member States are now largely exhausted in the form of commitments; the payments follow step by step. But if we want to remain credible, if we want to co-finance human dignity for the refugees from Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan who currently reside and live in Turkey, then we have to talk about the next three billion now. This will certainly be a focus of our discussions in the mediation process in the next few days. All in all: I don't see any fundamental contradictions, but rather a good will to come to an agreement. I should also like to mention that our letter of amendment number 1 of October 16 relates to agricultural expenditure and that we have planned certain reallocations here for reasons of updating, including an increase in the amounts for young farmers. I am looking forward to a debate today and then to good deliberations, Minister and honorable rapporteur, under your leadership over the next few weeks, with the aim of having a stable budget for next year in a few weeks.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 190, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Barbara MATERA", "mepid": "96813", "text": "draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I speak as draftsman of the opinion of the FEMM committee.

I think it is important for all of us that the European Parliament's budget also set priorities. We start with: As requested by the Council, we will of course also comply with the 1% reduction in posts per year; there will be internal shifts. But I believe that this target is of course not only a target for the European level, but it would also be very gratifying if the finance ministers at home in their own countries were to implement the 1% post reduction to show that they are doing it this statement is really serious. Of course, we are also focusing on preparing for the next European Parliament elections in 2019. Above all, we want to protect democracy in Europe. We do not want forces that are against democracy and only invest in the military to weaken Europe's soft power here. We also want to make our administration much more efficient, which means that we have pushed the Konrad Adenauer project in Luxembourg accordingly. We want to consistently implement the digitization of processes and the continuation of the introduction of the Irish language and also review the studies on Brexit and the funding of green transport accordingly. There is also a lot to do in the parliamentary budget for MEPs. In recent years there has been a lot of bureaucracy in the house, with a lot of reviews and audits. This requires additional massive activities from the MPs. The officials in Parliament are also burdened accordingly. We are therefore in favor of returning to the flat rate systems, that flat rates are paid. It's efficient, it's cost-effective and the best option for taxpayers.

I thank him for his availability and for having understood and interpreted the requests coming from citizens and also for having presented the budget today. I say this very sincerely, so there is no misunderstanding: I think we all agree in this House, at least we parliamentarians, that this is not yet the budget we want, because we cannot think that a budget equal to '1% of Europe's GDP is something satisfactory and that it gives answers to the challenges we have. And these are no small challenges: work, growth, help to our small and medium-sized enterprises, an economy that responds to the environmental challenges we have, responses to growth, issues related to migration flows, transport, common defense, as you ask us. With this budget we try to give some answers, we try to give those answers that, in our opinion, from our point of view, citizens ask us: the 600 million euros more we put on the initiative for young people, the increases to restore the correct figures that the Commission had put on Horizon 2020, on the CEF, all this means giving opportunities to our companies, our universities, our research bodies, municipalities and regions, that means. In the same way, on the issue of migration, we finally try to make a reasoning that comes out of the logic of the crisis, because we can no longer talk about the migration crisis, we can instead give answers that are lasting over time, both as regards aid. humanitarian, both as regards the reception in our countries and therefore have resources also for solidarity - even if solidarity, honestly, cannot be bought and does not have a figure, that must be given to us. You see, Minister Kivine, I have heard your words: You are concerned, you have said that you are concerned about the increases proposed by Parliament. I'm honestly worried about the rise and unemployment numbers, just to give you an example. And I believe that the conciliation that we are going to open in a few weeks is a phase in which we must seek answers to those concerns and not to the concerns of budgetary rules. I also see that we are all also worried about how populisms, anti-European parties, etc. are becoming increasingly popular. I try to give you a solution, I try to tell you what the answer can be: go back to politics. Go back to politics and give answers to the concrete and true problems of citizens. I think, Minister, that there are these opportunities in the conciliation phase that is opening up. It's up to you. I do not want to be disrespectful, but I am a bit tired - I think we all are - of hearing the heads of state and government tell us that this Europe does not work, and then when there is an opportunity to put in standing something, to give answers and to have a Europe that works, then there is no political will to give these answers. There is an agreement, there is a possibility of an agreement - we are getting there, we can do it.

When we talk about the 2018 budget, we experience the same game as every year: the Commission makes a proposal, the Council cuts this proposal, and the European Parliament increases it again, regularly even above the level of the Commission. You don't have to be a prophet to say: in the end, after all the negotiations, we will be very close to the Commission's proposal again. We have a crucial flaw here in our entire process, which is based on the fact that, especially here in the European Parliament, we believe that we can always call for more money. We should finally realize: this is European taxpayers' money; We cannot dispose of that indefinitely; we should use the money in the way it is made available to us, and that is usually somewhere close to the Commission proposal or the proposal of the Council. The decisive factor for me is not the call for more money, but that we use our money appropriately, purposefully and in a focused manner. In particular, this means that we have sufficient funds for the migration crisis, but also for security, research and ultimately to strengthen competition. Competition is not strengthened by permanent subsidies, on the contrary, it is even weakened. That is why we advocate abolishing permanent subsidies, with the exception of small areas such as environmental protection. Instead, we have to make subsidies degressive. That would strengthen competition, that would be real subsidiarity in practice, that we would go back to the freedom and personal responsibility of the Member States. Therefore we will not be able to support this draft. Nevertheless, I would like to thank both the Commissioner for his draft and the rapporteurs for their excellent work.

We are hesitant to make additions, but we have not excelled in the search for savings, that is what we have to say. In many Member States, however, the reality is different. There is great caution about increasing the EU budget. It is obvious that savings must be made after Britain leaves or will leave. I hope that, with a view to the next annual budgets, and in particular the next financial framework, we will also come together to think about areas where we can save or use existing money more efficiently.

Of course, one can argue that the budget is still not green enough, and I hope that next year the Commission will come up with a better proposal, but in that context, I would like to underline the great help and understanding given by the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE) Group and in particular by Mr Deprez and Ms Jäätteenmäki to improve their understanding in the budget to address the climate change policies.

In fact, I could probably save myself a couple of minutes and simply play a recording of last year’s speech, because the issues are pretty much the same this year as they are every year.  We know the drill: I could very easily say that these are our taxes, that we voted for Brexit, or that the EU is not spending its money efficiently or effectively, but I will not repeat and rehearse all the old arguments. I would note, though, that when politicians focus on the EU budget as a share of gross national income (GNI), that does not tell the whole story to the general public because the percentage of government spending is, of course, much higher than the percentage of GNI, and of course other government spending may well entail compliance costs with EU legislation.  When I spoke on this subject in committee, and indeed it has been the same in this debate today, I pointed out that the language that we use in these debates seems to be always the language of ‘cuts’ – it is all about how much a proposed cut here or a cut there is supposed to be. But, actually, what we are talking about here is still an increase, and the discussion is whether it is an above—inflation increase or a below—inflation increase.  What I want to see are genuine cuts, and for two reasons. One is that, with Brexit coming, there will, at one time or another – depending on how negotiations go – eventually be a shortfall. Two, I believe that on many projects it is just better and more efficient to cut out the middleman and for nation states to do things directly themselves. For saying that in committee, I was accused of populism, so I thought I would take a look at the word ‘populism’. I looked it up in the dictionary, and it tells me that populism is support for the concerns of ordinary people and the quality of appealing to – or being aimed at – ordinary people.

It is also repeated the fact that the Council, once again, makes cuts, and cuts without any rationality. The Council even cuts back on its own priorities - cuts against its proclamations and cuts against its own commitments. It is not acceptable, for example, to cut Horizon 2020, which has an excellent execution, which is the largest research program in the world and which is essential for innovation and the competitiveness of our economy. I challenge you to explain why you cut 491 million euros in commitments and 111 million euros in payments in this program. The Youth Employment initiative must be improved, but it must continue. Support for the backbone of our economy, which is SMEs, must also be increased. Cohesion policy is essential. External solidarity is also important. And then, Commissioner and Council, it is essential that we increase the implementation of cohesion policy. It is also essential that we have sufficient payments for the purpose of these programs, which are in the hands and management of the Member States.

In our votes today, we adopted a resolution on the next medium-term financial framework, and this resolution reiterates that the European Union's budget is currently underfunded. Against this background, it is particularly important for me to underline that new tasks that the Member States are entrusting to the European Union can only be financed with additional money. I am thinking particularly of the call for additional efforts in the area of ​​the common security and defense policy. Our colleague Kölmel from the Conservatives just said in his contribution: We should get by with the money that has been made available to us. That is a noble request. When I imagine: We have a pot of soup and the eaters are sitting around it and they are just getting full. And then there is an additional eater, which is security and defense policy in this case, but the soup is no longer. Then not everyone will be full anymore, and to that extent you cannot always get by with the money that is made available to you. This becomes particularly clear when we also think of the European Fund for Strategic Investments. We all want this fund to succeed. But we all want there to be investments in innovation and research - even the Council wants that. Mr Fernandes was right in pointing this out. I therefore cannot understand, Minister, why you are concerned here about the European Parliament's proposals for increasing additional efforts of EUR 416 million in research policy and over EUR 800 million for better transport routes and transnational power lines in Europe. These are investments in the future and in jobs in the European Union, and we should agree on that.(The speaker agreed to answer a question on the blue card procedure under Rule 162 (8) of the Rules of Procedure.)", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 217, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Bernd KÖLMEL", "mepid": "124824", "text": "Ask about the “blue card” procedure.- Mr Geier, just a quick question.You rightly ask: yes, where should one cut?Would you agree with me that the area of strengthening competitiveness should be critically examined if there are areas that have been promoted for decades and that obviously competitiveness has not yet been increased?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 218, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Jens GEIER", "mepid": "96833", "text": "Answer to a question about the “blue card” procedure.- I have no exact idea what area you are thinking of.When we hold such a discussion in Germany under such auspices, one generally thinks of agricultural policy.I am not saying that it is not possible to save in this budget.But I say that if the Member States take a position and say that we no longer want to pay into the budget, but we want the budget to do more and more, then tensions are inevitable at certain points.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 219, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Zbigniew KUŹMIUK", "mepid": "28389", "text": "- Mr Chairman!

I support the two major axes that our general rapporteur wanted to give to this budget, growth and employment, in particular vocational training for young people, on the one hand, and security and migratory flows, on the other. I would mainly like to stress the additional endowments needed in particularly successful programs, such as Horizon 2020 and Erasmus +, as well as in agencies which are growing in the fields of asylum, external border control and police cooperation. Erasmus +, the thirtieth anniversary of which has been brilliantly celebrated, generates frustration as more than one in two applications is rejected for lack of funds. The parameters of the upcoming negotiation are fairly simple: no revision of the financial framework, no arrears of payments. But nothing is over and, if we want to lead the conciliation in November and conclude it, I urge the Presidency to free itself from the eternal internal contradictions in the Council, between the short-sighted rigor of net contributors and vested interests. beneficiary countries, between the deep cuts in future programs and the under-use of cohesion funds - may I stress that we are going to return 10 billion euros at the end of 2017 due to the under- consumption? -, between the major declarations of the European Council and the weaknesses of European solidarity on the ground. Let’s not forget that this budget, due to Brexit, will perhaps be the last funded by 28 member states over twelve months.

The Parliament, in fact, wants to restore most of the cuts made by the Council for many items on which concrete and substantial savings could have been foreseen, especially on administrative expenses. The same Parliament has foreseen an increase in its costs, increasing its budget by 2.3% compared to 2017. We are talking about almost two billion, again this year, on the shoulders of taxpayers. Unfortunately, the costs of politics increase every year, the double headquarters in Brussels and Strasbourg continue to cost hundreds of millions a year and, even if there is a majority in this Parliament and among the Member States, they do not want to eliminate it. European funding for parties and foundations continued to increase, going from less than 17 million in 2009 to a proposal of almost 52 million for 2018. This budget line, which the 5 Star Movement rightly does not use, should be fully canceled. Among other things, the gap between the privileges of those involved in politics and the enormous sacrifices required of citizens is still too strong. Just think of the privilege of the members of this Parliament: a pension is provided without paying a euro of contributions, all borne by the citizens on whose shoulders, on the other hand, pension reforms are made, as in Italy the Fornero reform. In addition to administrative waste, in our opinion, useless and harmful projects must be cut, such as the Turin-Lyon railway section, which does not bring any added value for the dome, even criminal at times, of public contracts and subcontracts, which, in infrastructural in Italy, we have seen how you work very well.

You saw that the works were very successful and that there were a lot of participants in the tenders and I would just like to draw attention to one very simple thing: I don't understand why you can't find very small amounts of money, under ten million euros, in order to complete the coverage of the EGNOS system, a system that is vital for air transport.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 228, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Isabelle THOMAS", "mepid": "114279", "text": "- Mr President, I in turn would like to congratulate our rapporteurs, Siegfried Mureşan and Richard Ashworth, who have done a remarkable job and who have worked in harmony with the majority of Parliament. Before turning to the budget, I take advantage of the presence of the Council representatives to ask you, Ladies and Gentlemen, to change the leaders' program. Indeed, it was validated while ignoring and in contempt of respect for Parliament and the Commission, proposing to conclude the future multiannual financial framework at the end of 2019, that is to say when there will be, at the same time , constitution of Parliament and of the future Commission. Thank you for hearing this request. Regarding the budget, I would like to emphasize two points. The first is a simple principle: consistency. We share with the Commission and the Council most of the priorities for 2018: investment, jobs, sustainable growth, management of migration challenges. Proof of this is that we are planning to increase these budget lines. Therefore, in order to maintain this consistency, we will not be able to accept any reduction in these amounts during the negotiations. The second point is our determination in the fight against youth unemployment, a scourge which affects the very future of the European Union. Commissioner, I would not want there to be any misinterpretation of what we are proposing. In no case are we proposing an advance, a frontloading in 2018 of the appropriations provided for by the revision of the multiannual financial framework in order to relaunch the initiative for young people. What the majority of this Parliament wants is for the European Union to invest half a billion euros in the youth guarantee for 2018. Billions are being announced to support strategic industries, billions to boost investment, very good! So for 2018, we need half a billion against this social catastrophe of unemployment among young people, half a billion for solidarity and to prepare for the future.You can be sure that this will be a point on which Parliament will be uncompromising in the negotiations to come.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 229, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "James NICHOLSON", "mepid": "1318", "text": "   – Mr President, I would also like to congratulate both rapporteurs.

I want to welcome the strengthening of the appropriations allocated to defense research. It is a pressing need in the current state of destabilization of our eastern and southern flanks and we must move forward towards a European Defense Union. I welcome the reduction or reallocation of pre-accession aid which Turkey is currently receiving. It is time to show Erdogan that his authoritarian drift is not bearable and that he must stop insulting European leaders. I welcome the strengthening, requested by the citizens of all our countries, of the resources devoted to the fight against terrorism. Europol, in particular, needs more staff and more operational funds to improve coordination between the police and security forces of our Member States. Lastly, I welcome the fact that the resolution proposed to us expressly calls, on my proposal, for the creation of a financial assistance mechanism for victims of terrorist attacks.

As usual we are witnessing this negotiation, this debate where the Commission asks for more resources - every year it asks to increase the budget - and the Council and the Member States want to cut and refuse to give more resources, indeed they would like some back . I believe this is truly proof that this project cannot go on. We must ask ourselves why the Member States do not want to invest additional resources in the budget but want to keep them on their national territory to invest them in other ways, without sending them in a complex way to Brussels. There will be a reason why they prefer not to invest in an instrument that today does not give the expected results in terms of growth, in terms of new development, in terms of job creation. The reality is that the EU budget today is burning billions of euros in failed projects, which have failed to achieve those promised goals - I am talking about the Juncker plan, I am talking about the billions burned for the Youth Guarantee, I am talking about, for example, new projects on common defense or the support of funds for Africa. My question is: if we already struggle to achieve results within our borders, let alone what the results may be by going to operate in other countries. And of course there is a continuous increase in administrative expenses. What is the European Union doing?

However, I believe that it is extremely important to be anchored in the realities on the ground when discussing the long-term efficiency of spending. It is not enough to tick an expenditure related to an area without assessing, in a concrete way, the impact of these expenses and, in particular, the benefits and sustainability of the investments. In the field of agriculture, we must take into account the major challenges of this sector, ranging from the phenomenon of aggressive aging, from the lack of labor, to the search for new markets. That is why I believe that the program for the installation of young farmers must be further supported, as a guarantee of preventing the depopulation of rural areas. At the same time, we must ensure the sustainability of these farms in the medium and long term, by identifying new markets as we continue to face the Russian embargo. However, I believe that we need to be extremely careful with the trade agreements that are concluded at the level of the European Union, referring in particular to the one with the Mercosur countries. Such an agreement is likely to create major difficulties for us, given that farmers in these countries are not required to comply with any limits on cadmium, glyphosate or antibiotics, which allows them to obtain a unit cost per unit. produced far below that obtained by a European farmer, and this affects the long-term sustainability of European investment in agriculture.

Restoring the budget allocated to the European Solidarity Corps is not an opposition to the initiative, but adopting and reaffirming the right order of things. In the same way, the formalized proposal to increase the funding foreseen in particular for the Erasmus youth sector is more appropriate than ever, a unanimous position of the CULT commission, which is part of the strategy aimed at reaching more and more children and young people outside the country with Erasmus funding. from traditional training courses. Hence the indication is to multiply the Erasmus + budget in the next financial framework and make it a program for all Europeans. On a more general level, then, if we want a Europe more up to its ambitions, the 2018 budget begins with a path towards a significant increase in the allocations of the next financial framework, to be obtained to a greater extent with own resources.

The key issues for me are strengthening the economy, competitiveness, employment, in particular for young people, and security. However, education and culture directly related to strengthening a competitive knowledge-based economy should not be forgotten. As a member of the CULT committee and the long-term budget rapporteur for this committee, I would therefore like to emphasize in particular the role of adequate support for programs in the field of culture and education and call for the allocation of sufficient commitment and payment appropriations to these programs to ensure that they are properly implemented in line with their objectives. and to tackle their low success rates due to under-funding. These programs have clearly demonstrated their European added value and enjoy unflagging popularity among the beneficiaries.

To grant discharge, ladies and gentlemen, that is not an abstract thing. That is the end result of a thorough exercise, an exercise in supervision and control by Parliament of how the money from the European budget, and thus the European citizen and taxpayer, has been spent over the past year. Were the correct procedures followed? Can it be substantiated how much money was used where? Moreover, did the resources used ensure that citizens got value for money? The basic premise of any proper and proper discharge should be that everyone who spends money from the European budget must be monitored in a transparent manner as to how it was done and also whether it was done responsibly. The European Parliament is responsible for this exercise in accordance with the Treaties of the European Union. The Council makes a recommendation to the European Parliament on this matter. Unfortunately, since 2011, the European Parliament has refused to grant discharge to the Council, based on the fact that there is an ongoing power struggle between Parliament and the Council, and also on the basis that Parliament has a habit of to put questions to institutions to which it must grant discharge, both in writing and orally. The Council takes a purely legalistic position and believes that the European Parliament should really only grant discharge to the Commission. That is not in line with practice. Parliament puts questions to the Commission, puts questions to the Secretary-General of the European Parliament, puts questions to the Economic and Social Committee, the Committee of the Regions, all agencies. The Council, on the other hand, refuses to answer our questions. The Council therefore refuses dialogue. It must be said - I admit it: there is progress. The Council is presenting more and more information on its website, so that little by little we find out what is happening with the budget of the Council, the Council of Ministers and the European Council. Nevertheless, relations between Parliament and the Council of Ministers remained particularly tense until last year. Let's face it: only dialogue ultimately leads to a solution. At the start of my mandate as rapporteur, I therefore met the Secretary-General of the Council. Ms Gräßle, Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, did the same. We wanted to find out what the outlines are for arriving at a modus vivendi, to improve relations between Parliament and the Council when it comes to granting discharge. After long and extensive discussions with my shadow rapporteurs, in close consultation with the chairman of the Committee on Budgetary Control and in close consultation with the coordinators of all political groups in the Committee on Budgetary Control, we have reached an agreement. That agreement was presented to the Conference of Presidents last Thursday and since then we, as Committee on Budgetary Control, have a mandate to enter into negotiations with the Council of Ministers, myself as rapporteur, Ms Gräßle as chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control and in the presence of Klaus Welle, Secretary-General of the European Parliament. What are those contours? What is that mandate? 1. The Council and the European Parliament play different roles in the discharge. The European Parliament grants discharge. The Council gives an opinion and a recommendation to the European Parliament on the discharge. 2.

However, I will try to be as to-the-point as I can and, taking it from where the honourable rapporteur ended, from the Council’s position we also see a faint glimmering, a sparkle of hope, in moving things towards improvement.  Going through my formal statement, it is my duty as President of the Council to identify the two aspects of this reiterative annual process: both going through the same procedure as every year, but also now seeing some potential for movement.  The Council’s position, however, stands. It says that the Council has always scrupulously respected Article 319 of the Treaty according to which the European Parliament, acting on a recommendation from the Council, gives a single discharge to the Commission. As you know, over recent years the Council has considerably improved access to relevant information about the activities, the governance and the financial management of the institution. This is, by the way, recognised in the text of the resolution you will be voting on.  As in previous years, the European Court of Auditors did not detect any serious weaknesses in respect of the issues examined for the Council.  In 2011, the Council transmitted to Parliament the draft memorandum of understanding in order to organise better the cooperation between our two institutions during the discharge procedure. The Council has always been open to discuss concrete issues and concrete drafting. I understand today that the Conference of Presidents has recently agreed on a mandate in this regard and we think this could be a new momentum. I hope that our institutions will have the opportunity to discuss this soon.

The EU Treaties may say that the Parliament only grants discharge to the Commission, but I think there is a moral obligation to comply with what is essentially a transparency process.

Well, Mr President, perhaps we in Britain could have our share of that; I think it works out at about 500 bottles by our budget contribution to celebrate Brexit. We would even settle for 148 bottles, if we divided equally between the countries. That would be enough to celebrate Brexit! But seriously, when half of Europe is in some form of crisis and with austerity biting, you are ordering four thousand bottles of champagne.

First of all, I wish to express my sincere condolences to her family, friends and colleagues. The circumstances of the death of Ms Caruana Galizia have rendered us speechless, but this debate shows that we shall not remain silent. We strongly condemn this barbaric crime. The perpetrators must be brought to justice. The mission of journalists requires personal devotion and courage, and those who have these qualities deserve our deepest respect and protection.  Media freedom is an indispensable pillar of our democratic societies. Journalists are the guardians of properly functioning democracies. Where there is no freedom of speech and people have to fear for their life every time they criticise something, there is no democracy. For this reason freedom of expression, media freedom and pluralism are guaranteed in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. They are among the core basic democratic values on which the European Union is founded. These freedoms are an obligation for our governments. It is an absolute priority for all democracies to protect journalists also from financial or political pressure. The importance of media pluralism as a prerequisite of the rule of law and democracy was underlined by the Council in its annual rule of law dialogue last week.  Let me be clear: attacks on media representatives to silence their voices are unacceptable everywhere in the world. If they occur, we have to act immediately: condemn the crime, find and punish the perpetrators and re-establish the confidence of our citizens in the functioning of our democratic institutions. I am convinced that we are all aware of the responsibility of our governments for the protection of journalists and the defence of media freedom.  We commend and trust in the Maltese authorities in ensuring that justice is delivered. As the Presidency, we would like to join other Member States, which offered help to the Maltese authorities in the investigation of this appalling crime. We owe this to the memory of Ms Caruana Galizia and to all journalists serving our societies.

A wife, a mother, a mother-in-law, a friend, a neighbour, a colleague. Daphne Caruana Galizia appears to have been killed because someone wanted to stop her from reporting. And it happened right here, in the European Union!  Let me first express my deepest condolences to her family and loved ones. Your loss, I cannot imagine. I did not have the privilege to know Daphne personally but a few things stand out – her courage and doggedness in the pursuit of the truth, her readiness to ask the questions that really matter about politicians of all colours.  The very heart of democracy is that those who the people choose to lead them are also accountable to them. Journalists such as Daphne represent us all when they ask the difficult questions and when they keep digging even if it becomes uncomfortable and dangerous to find the truth.  When I attended the spontaneous vigil last Wednesday in Brussels, when I stood here in silence with you earlier today in the presence of Daphne’s family, to whom I have had the chance to express my condolences in person this morning, my deep concerns about what this tragic event represents in terms of our democratic values were dwarfed by the immediate human tragedy: the three sons and a daughter-in-law suddenly and violently losing a mother, and a husband prematurely and painfully losing his beloved wife.  At the European Council last week and again this morning, President Tajani made a strong call for a detailed in-depth international investigation. On behalf of President Juncker and all my colleagues in the College, I can say that the Commission very much agrees that ensuring an independent and thorough investigation of the facts and bringing those responsible to justice must be the top priority for now.  Prime Minister Muscat gave such an assurance to his fellow leaders on Thursday and the eyes of Europe and the world are now on Malta to ensure this is the case. I welcome the fact that the Maltese authorities have engaged with their counterparts in Europe and beyond, including forensics experts from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States, and wherever useful, Europol and Eurojust are there to help.  We know that good journalism can be a dangerous job. Last year 72 journalists were killed worldwide and more than 50 others have died so far this year. But the targeted and brutal manner of Daphne’s killing and the fact that it happened here on the soil of one of our Member States profoundly shocks. Even here in Europe, too many journalists are threatened every day. The campaign ‘Mapping Media Freedom’ has already reported more than 300 alerts of threats to journalistic freedom in the EU since the beginning of the year and more than 3 000 since the beginning of the project.  I pay tribute to all those who have stood up and asked the tough questions. Since – and I say this as a politician and democrat among politicians and democrats – since professional journalism is a necessary job because it ensures that all of us who are entrusted with certain responsibilities are also scrutinised for how we exercise them, that perhaps matters now more than ever, as we find ourselves in an era where anyone can publish their views online, where facts and fiction are sometimes mixed, where false information is repeated ever louder.  I have said before in this House that everyone is entitled to her or his own opinions, but no one is entitled to their own facts. That is what journalists do. They are the human face of stubborn facts. That is their job, their mission. A free media is the watchdog in our democracies.  Healthy democracy requires a free and pluralistic media, free from state intervention and from undue political or commercial pressures. Ed Murrow put it well when he said that every healthy democracy needs a good dose of itching pills, and as President Juncker said last week, the right of a journalist to investigate, to ask uncomfortable questions and report effectively is at the heart of our values and needs to be guaranteed at all times.  Under the Treaties, the Commission has limited powers in this area. We can, however, encourage and guide, which is why last year we chose to devote our annual colloquium on fundamental rights to the theme of media pluralism and democracy. Three quarters of respondents to the public consultation covering all our Member States in preparation for the colloquium said that they were aware of or have experienced limitations on journalistic activities by state measures, and more than two thirds of respondents said they have experienced or are aware of censorship and self-censorship. Such findings are very worrying. If journalists have to fear for their lives just for doing their job, they cannot operate with a level of freedom and independence that is essential for the media in any democracy, in any rule-of-law based society.  Media freedom and pluralism are fundamental rights enshrined in Article 11 of the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights and constitute essential foundations of our democratic societies. It is the duty of the Maltese state to investigate and prosecute this case in accordance with its constitution, its legal order and international human rights obligations. The Maltese authorities and institutions must deliver on their commitment to do everything in their power to ensure that the perpetrators will be brought to justice.  Malta needs to show to Europe and the world that its rules and regulations are healthy and robust. This is why it is important that the Maltese Government has indicated that the investigation and prosecution should be allowed to run their full course, that if problems of a more general or systemic nature are brought to light, they should also be addressed, regardless of the consequences.  Today’s debate proves once more that the eyes of Europe stay firmly fixed on Malta, because the murder of a brave journalist such as Daphne is a direct concern for us all. We will, it is our duty, continue to stand up for our shared values. Why? Well, for the sake of Daphne, her loved ones and everything she stood for, for the sake of the European Union and everything it stands for.

This morning I met with the widower and the children of Daphne Caruana and then I cried. Hopefully all the groups had a chance to listen to you. Daphne Caruana dedicated her entire life to journalism; she raised her voice where others don't dare; she faced governments, politicians, companies and mafias, no matter how many or how powerful. As one of her children said, she stood between the rule of law and those who wanted to violate it, and that is why they murdered her. She died with more than 42 open court cases and without even having access to her bank accounts. Harassed. Before murdering her, they made life impossible for her and her family; somehow, they started killing her when she was still alive. They have not killed rulers, they have not killed judges, they have not killed policemen. They have killed a journalist. And when in a state the rulers, the judges and the police live happily while journalists are killed, it means that democracy is failing. The disappearance of Daphne Caruana is much more than the tragic murder of an uncomfortable journalist. It is a message. It is a call to silence. She is a direct threat to all those who, like her, exercise journalism with freedom and independence. It is an attack on freedom of expression. There can be no true democracy without a free press. We fail Daphne. She failed the European Union, of which she did not serve as a citizen on European soil. Nothing and no one protected her sufficiently, especially the authorities and the Government of Malta, who should have guaranteed her safety and that of her family. They did not. Sadly, Caruana's murder is not an isolated case, as are not the letters that some media outlets in Malta are receiving threatening millionaire litigation for damages. That is also a compulsion. Murders in Mexico, murders in India, mass arrests of journalists in Turkey; even in the The United States president allows himself to question the patriotism of some journalists. Our problem is that Malta is at the heart of the European Union and it shows us that we, we, are not free from this global threat against journalism. The murder of Daphne Caruana is a shadow that falls on our conscience as proud Europeans. The European Union can therefore no longer be silent about what is happening in Malta. Our silence is the victory of Daphne's assassins and the defeat of democratic institutions. That is why my group has asked the European Commission to ensure a fully independent judicial investigation. We want to know who did it. We want to know why she did it. And we want to know who protects him from her and that they all go to jail. And I invite the Commission to urgently investigate the situation of the rule of law in Malta. As Daphne reminded us in her last words, the situation is desperate. All of us, the Commission as well, must ask ourselves whether we did enough. Ladies and gentlemen, just yesterday another journalist was stabbed at a radio station in Russia. Russian journalists tell the world: nobody defends us. Well, we did not defend Daphne, and for that reason to her children and with my heart in hand in this room, I apologize and say: I wish I could assure you that it will never happen again, that your mother will be the last! But I can not. We have to fight for freedom of expression every minute, every hour, every day and in every country in the world, knowing that the fight will be to the death and that it will never end. Without good journalism or good journalists, no democracy is complete. That is why European democracy will always lack Daphne.

Frans Timmermans said well: killing a journalist for her work means attacking freedom of information and thought, which is a fundamental value of the European Union. Whoever ordered and carried out this attack is an enemy of Europe. We need to catch those responsible as soon as possible: Europe and the Member States make the best investigators available to Maltese investigators, the Prime Minister and the Maltese Government have asked. But in addition to judicial truths, there is a political response that challenges us all. When, a week ago, I saw the scenes of the attack I immediately thought of my country, of Italy, of the mafia bombs that killed judges Falcone and Borsellino. Those bombs marked a turning point in the fight against the Sicilian mafia and the Italian state won its battle because it proved ruthless and united. Today we need to be united among us. All those who love freedom of thought and democracy join in this struggle. And it is not true that the European Parliament has been silent on these issues. The European Parliament set up a committee of inquiry on Panama leaks a year ago, which met Daphne in the course of its work. Last week the first conclusions of the investigation were approved: battle against the international mafia, fight against money laundering to track down illegal flows (we are united on this!), Black list of tax havens and sanctions for those who are complicit in these. These are the things that the special commission has asked for and that Europe must do now. We must better defend the freedom of those who provide information, I share this imperative and this concern. Journalism, especially investigative journalism, will always be uncomfortable, it must be uncomfortable, because it is counterpower and without that counterpower democracy and the rule of law are weaker.We need powers and counterpowers, this is democracy.The conditions must therefore be created for journalists to work throughout Europe and in the world - and in the world!Russian journalists, too, everywhere - in safe conditions, so that their sources are protected.Just this morning we voted on a resolution in which we ask the European Commission to present a proposal on whistleblowers, on the protection of whistleblowers, who are an important source for finding the culprits.Let's go ahead on this path, and I too want to greet and give the thoughts of my political group, and also my personal one, to Daphne's family members and reiterate that it is a moral duty, rather than a political one, to make sure that this so painful lossand so brutal in its development is not in vain.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 285, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Monica MACOVEI", "mepid": "96824", "text": "on behalf of the ECR Group. - A WikiLeaks in one woman: Daphne Caruana Galicia.

Her name has been mentioned several times here today and I would also like to give my condolences to her family. I met her sons this afternoon and I was really impressed by their wisdom and their strength, but if you read about her life, that’s not surprising. She was an exceptionally courageous and strong woman, and I think that we have to show the same courage, because I think we are all united today in shock, in grief and in our wish to uphold freedom of the media, freedom of expression. But we also have to act. The first one to act, obviously, is the Maltese Government: they will have to investigate her murder and make sure that the murderers do not get away with impunity. But also those who actually wanted her gone should not get away with impunity, because this was not just a murder tackling an individual person – she was exposing corruption and crime. We should investigate that as well, because this is not a mere Maltese problem: this is a European problem. We are talking about international networks of corruption and crime, money—laundering, hiding criminal money, and so on. So I think there is a task here for the European Union, and I think the European People’s Party just suggested that we investigate the rule of law in Malta – that was a kind of general statement, but I do think it is very important that we get clarifications from the Maltese Government about the allegations of corruptions which she was investigating. We have to continue that investigation, and I would suggest that first of all – in the very short term, within the next couple of weeks – that we organise an ECON-LIBE hearing and invite experts on the Maltese situation; on the investigations into corruption and crime. But I think we should also look into ways of continuing that and deepening that investigation and make sure that we eradicate corruption and crime and money laundering from the European Union, and Malta is part of the European Union. Finally, Commissioner, you said that the European Commission doesn’t have the competences to actually intervene, and I don’t think (as Mr González Pons said) that it is for the European Commission to conduct a police investigation into a murder. But you can investigate allegations of corruption, and you can indeed investigate allegations that, for example, the judiciary or the police is not independent, because if one Member State – whether it is Malta, Poland, Hungary, France or indeed the Netherlands or Romania – does not uphold the European standards when it comes to the rule of law, that means that there is no rule of law in the European Union. We have an area of freedom, security and justice, so if one Member State doesn’t function in this respect, then the whole system fails. So it is in everybody’s interests that we investigate. Is that painful? Yes it is. But this is a political union: we all have to make sure that these problems are eradicated, and I think we owe it to Daphne. We cannot just make statements here; we have to be courageous and go against those who actually do not wish us to investigate.  This has to be done, and I hope that we are going to find agreement amongst all the political groups for the exact instruments – the appropriate instruments – in honour of Daphne.

Ladies and gentlemen, we must remember that tax havens within the European Union are a black thread that links tax fraud with networks of crime, corruption and persecution of journalists and leakers. The case of Daphne Caruana is a dramatic example of the complicity between the interests of criminal networks and oligarchies. It should be remembered that commissions of inquiry, such as the one on the Panama papers, are possible thanks to the work of journalists like Daphne, who revealed the Panama accounts of several Maltese ministers. Her investigation threatened many interests that are often even defended from this chamber, such as fiscal opacity, bank secrecy or the free movement of capital. We understand that it is essential to put the rights of whistleblowers above the private interest of companies. Today we have approved a report demanding legislation that protects and covers all the activities of whistleblowers and journalists. Also, in the report to be presented by the PANA Commission, we have requested that an agency and specific communication channels be established to protect those who risk their lives to bring to light information that benefits society as a whole. Let us hope that all groups in this House will vote in favor of these measures.

First of all, our sincere condolences go to the family of Daphne, whom I got to know as one of the most courageous people in the fight for justice and the rule of law in Europe. The way in which Daphne was killed tells us a lot about the unjust and criminal system which she was fighting. Daphne was killed in the open, there was no hiding. Her murderers did not even try to make the attack appear to be an accident. On the contrary, this was a brutal demonstration of power by those who consider themselves above the law. It is very clear why the murderers did not place a bomb under the car of the police chief or the attorney general. It was Daphne who shed light on a system of money-laundering and corruption in Malta, and not these authorities. Let me just name a small selection of illegal, or at least illegitimate, activities that Daphne has made public: letterbox companies owned by members of the government; the sale of passports to so-called investors; tax avoidance for multinational companies; online gambling based on weak supervision and hyper-low taxation. All these cases have one thing in common. Malta has sold its sovereignty to dirty money. Malta has replaced the rule of law with a culture of impunity for the powerful, and fiddling between political and financial elites. This is Europe, not Russia. Europe must act when fundamental rights are at stake. It is now up to us to finish Daphne’s fight, and therefore we would like to suggest five concrete steps. First, an international investigator has to be appointed who will be fully involved in the ongoing investigations on money-laundering and corruption in Malta. Second, Malta should take that opportunity finally to join the European Prosecutor. Third, we demand a serious investigation by the European Commission on the rule of law in Malta and systematic Treaty infringement procedures to enforce anti-money laundering law everywhere in Europe. Fourth, we also support Daphne’s family in their demand for the Muscat government to step down because of its failure in enforcing the rule of law in Malta. And lastly, we are proposing the introduction of a European Galizia prize here in this House for investigative journalists, modelled on the Sakharov Prize. The murderous attack on Daphne was an attack on European values, our fundamental principles. Let us not forget that people who suffer from corruption in their countries put their hopes in Europe. Let us not disappoint these citizens. Let us not disappoint Daphne and her family.

Nowadays, the attempt to abolish press freedom includes other methods, such as arrests and convictions of journalists and publishers, closure of newspapers, and banning the use of social media, as President Erdogan is doing in Turkey. Even in Greece, only a few brave journalists step in to the MPs, MEPs and executives of our party, Golden Dawn, the country's third political force, because they are afraid that their employers will fire them. All states must realize that journalists have a function and must protect them in order to carry out their work unhindered, thus guaranteeing freedom of the press, which is a basic principle of democracy.

Today, for the Commission, is about honouring the memory of Daphne, it is about sharing our grief in this Parliament. But I fully recognise that the only way we can really honour her memory is by following up on the issues that underlie the assassination.  This starts, of course, with a full investigation of what has happened and bringing to justice those who are responsible. As I said in my contribution, if in this investigation, and in the course of this analysis, things are brought to light that are of a more structural nature or that warrant other actions, the Commission will certainly not hesitate to assume its responsibility, where we have a responsibility. Let me also add that in our Work Programme for next year we have insisted on the need, jointly with the European Parliament, to come up with a better protection of whistle-blowers. This is also an important step we need to take.  My colleague Věra Jourová promised to the Special Committee of Inquiry on Money Laundering, Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion (PANA) in July that we would also step up our efforts to implement the decisions we have taken on fighting money laundering. I can, for instance, give as an example that we have now – let me just check the numbers – we have opened infringement cases that concern 14 Member States which have not notified laws transposing the 4th Directive and two Member States whose laws clearly show that these were not sufficient to transpose the Directive. We will continue this work in close contact also with this Parliament. We are always prepared to engage directly with the Maltese authorities at a political level to make sure that they implement the rules that we agreed at European level.  Let me end on the following. The effect of such a public display of barbarism – which this assassination was – the intended effect, of course, is to intimidate, to make sure that no investigation is carried out any more, that nothing is pursued, that others will be self-censoring their own investigation. I think this is the biggest challenge we face: that we are not intimidated by what was done; that we as Europeans collectively accept the responsibility in the EU to make sure that we are not intimidated; that institutions can function independently; that perpetrators are brought to justice; that if this is linked to organised crime or to corruption, that this is pursued. And this Commission will leave no stone unturned in that area to make sure that this atrocious, barbarous assassination does not lead to the conclusion which is clearly wanted by those who perpetrated it, namely that we don’t dare ask questions or we don’t dare investigate. This will not happen. This is a promise I make on behalf of the Commission, and this is how we will pursue the issue in close cooperation also with the Maltese authorities and other bodies that could be implicated in the investigation.

The gruesome murder of the investigative journalist and blogger Daphne Caruana Galizia in Malta, who was involved in the processing of the Panama Papers, made it clear to us last week that freedom of expression can also be fatal. This sad event shows once again that journalists, bloggers and all those who have the courage to uncover hidden machinations in the public interest deserve special protection through appropriate laws. As a former journalist, it is particularly important to me to point this out. In the European Parliament, we Social Democrats voted for greater protection for whistleblowers. Whistleblowers help to expose corruption and shady business. It must not happen that they are often prosecuted for the fact that their job, their freedom and sometimes even their life are at stake.

Tomorrow we will vote in favor of much stronger health and safety legislation in the EU. It is not just any legislation, but one that is about protecting workers, millions of workers in Europe, from carcinogens and mutagens. We have been waiting ten years for this. The previous Commission did not get much done, unfortunately. Fortunately, the current Commission has acted differently. We in Parliament have therefore welcomed the Commission's proposal, and in our committee work we have done everything we can to make the proposal even stronger. The facts are as follows: More than half of all work-related deaths are linked to cancer. Cancer is the single heaviest and most extensive cause of work-related death. So we can not have it. Not in a modern society that values ​​human dignity. We must not accept competing with poor conditions, with dangerous work environments; it can never be a means of competition for the EU. We must compete with being absolutely skilled and best at what we do, not with people dying from their jobs. In addition to the enormous personal cost, the estimated cost to Member States is € 334 billion annually. So that's what the cancer costs. It is a senseless loss, not only in human life but also in social costs. Tomorrow, we will vote on thirteen new limit values ​​for carcinogens and mutagenic substances that exist in the workplace. Eleven new subjects and two are being revised. These are substances that are found in a wide range of industries and in a wide range of workplaces, including the construction industry, the wood industry, the paper industry, in the production of everything from solvents, paper, furniture, toys, cars, aircraft. Hexavalent chromium, quartz dust and hard wood dust are some of the most important substances that are now regulated, given how many workers are exposed to precisely these limit values. Compared to the Commission's original proposal, which was already a big one improvement, Parliament succeeded in calling for further improvements in the negotiations. That, Mr President, we can be proud of. Throughout the process, we have emphasized the importance of starting from the precautionary principle. We must put the health and safety of workers first. The Commission proposed thirteen new limit values, which in themselves will save more than 100,000 people over the age of 50. This is a figure that does not even take into account the improved health checks or the limit values ​​that we have achieved in the negotiations. The health checks in the directive have now caught up with the asbestos directive. Thanks to Parliament, workers will be entitled to health checks even after leaving the workplace to which they have been exposed. The agreement with the council also includes stricter limit values ​​for hexavalent chromium and hard wood dust in the proposal. These are substances that cause such serious cancers as lymphosarcoma and lung cancer. We have also agreed that in future the Commission will have to review the legislation to evaluate whether the directive should be broadened to include substances that interfere with reproduction, ie substances that can harm the fertility of both men and women and unborn children. It is my and the committee's view that these substances are so serious that they should be covered by the most stringent wording of the directive. The Commission will return to this, hopefully before the end of its term. I would like to emphasize the good cooperation that has been the basis for us now being able to adopt the revision of this directive.

There is the principle of equal pay for equal work at the same place, which has yesterday been embraced by a large majority from East and West in the Council, but this Commission has also reinvigorated the promotion of workers’ health and safety. The protection of workers’ health and safety at work has therefore also been included as one of the principles of the European Pillar of Social Rights which was also embraced yesterday by the Council, to be proclaimed in November by the three institutions The fight against occupational cancer is also a matter of priority for me personally. Cancer kills more workers than any other work-related disease and causes many families enormous suffering. I am pleased that the Council and the European Parliament have reached a timely compromise on our first proposal to update the Directive on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens and mutagens at work. This agreement between the co-legislators confirms the strong political commitment by all the European institutions to fight against work-related cancer. It should also pave the way for the second and third batches with a view to continue enhancing the protection of workers.  I would like to thank once again the rapporteur Ms Ulvskog for her commitment during the interinstitutional negotiations. This indeed enabled us to reach agreement on this file at first reading. It is only fair to say that the negotiations were not easy. For Parliament, one of the key points in the discussions was to include reprotoxic substances in the scope of this directive. In the end, a fair compromise was reached with the Council. The deal was a review clause which says that ‘not later than the first quarter of 2019 the Commission shall assess the opportunity of amending the scope of this directive to include reprotoxic substances’.  I can assure you that the Commission will deliver on this clause. This, however, as you all know requires comprehensive analytical work. Another difficult element in the negotiation was the exposure limit values to Chromium VI, respirable crystalline [silica] and hardwood and softwood dusts. In the end, an agreement was reached in line with the results of the scientific research and the discussions we had with the social partners. Thank you for all your work; I think we can be happy about the results and we will continue to cooperate further.

We cannot accept that workers destroy their health or lose their life trying to gain it. First of all, allow me to warmly thank the Commission, and in particular the Commissioner, Marianne Thyssen. While new substances have emerged, we had to wait ten years before this directive was subject to review. With its proposal, the Commission puts an end to this inaction. The institutional agreement which will be put to the vote tomorrow combines both ambition and pragmatism. Ambition, because it sets strict standards for occupational exposure. Pragmatism, because it provides for transitional periods allowing companies to adapt and to comply with the new rules. I would indeed have liked reprotoxic substances to be directly covered by this directive. This was not possible, but I am nevertheless pleased that the Commission and the Council have taken note of this call from Parliament and are taking action on it in the coming months.

Secondly, because the Commission has also undertaken to undertake, by the end of the first quarter of 2019, a study on the inclusion of reprotoxic products in a future revision of the Directive. This review is justified because it is feared that reprotoxins may pose risks for reproductive health, namely for the development of the fetus, as well as during the breastfeeding period.

Commissioner! Safe working conditions, especially health security, are one of the key conditions for decent work and fair employment. We have it enshrined in the Treaty's Charter of Fundamental Rights, so it can also be considered a human right. And in this context, the fact of this report, which I congratulate the rapporteur very much, and I consider this revision of the directive very important, because scientific developments allow us, in principle, to conduct reviews quite frequently, which will allow us to verify the list of harmful substances, carcenogens or mutagens, and and they can allow us to verify these acceptable levels that we use. And these things are very important. I consider it particularly important in this report - and in line with previous calls from the European Parliament - this proposal to extend the scope of the directive to agents that are harmful to reproduction. Infertility, diseases of the reproductive system, lactation disorders or faulty fetal development are among the potential effects of harmful substances, and they are also one of the greatest concerns of workers in the context of exposure to harmful substances in the workplace. Both the legal protection and the related prophylaxis regarding the period of pregnancy do not cover the period before pregnancy or at a very early stage, when it is not yet formally established and reported.

Therefore, from the very beginning, the Polish delegation in the PPE group supported the European Commission's project on the protection of workers against the risk of exposure to carcinogens or mutagens. The limits proposed by the European Commission were based on reliable analyzes and an agreement developed between social partners. Unfortunately, during the work on this directive, there were attempts in Parliament to drastically tighten the limits contained in the initial draft, not necessarily resulting from the need to protect health. The consequences of such a restrictive approach could be very dangerous. There are too many cases when, when it is impossible to meet excessive requirements, some companies begin to violate the law, and this has a very negative effect on the health of employees. In most cases, we have found reasonable solutions, but I cannot agree with the solutions proposed primarily for hardwood dust. The compromise limit is too restrictive. In my country, sawmills and producers of wood products are mainly small and medium-sized entrepreneurs and the unjustified reduction of wood dust to two milligrams per cubic meter is impossible for them. The same is the case with chromium. I am convinced that, as Parliament, we should base our decisions on sound scientific research and, above all, encourage industry and scientists to seek alternative materials and methods of production, and give entrepreneurs, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, time to adapt.

As always, we take note of your questions and remarks and, as I said, our work will not stop here. This legislative proposal is a first step in a series of forthcoming initiatives in this area.  I am pleased that in June this year the Council reached a general approach on our second proposal to amend the Directive. This confirms the political commitment of both the Commission and the Member States to fight occupational cancer. I count on the European Parliament to adopt its position on this second batch so that the interinstitutional negotiations should start as soon as possible.  Dear Members of Parliament, some of you mentioned diesel engine exhausts and that this is one of the 25 chemical agents evaluated that are of a major concern for causing occupational cancer. Why have we not yet proposed an occupational exposure limit (OEL)? Diesel engine exhaust is a complex issue, in particular in terms of defining exposure and identifying adequate measurement methods. It contains different components depending on the type of engine used. Identifying the engines that produce carcinogenic exhaust requires further analysis. The Commission is continuing its efforts to find the most appropriate action, and has the intention to include diesel engine emissions (DEE) in its forthcoming second phase consultation of the social partners with a view to considering to address DEE in the fourth batch. Work—related cancer is a real tragedy for workers and their families, and is at the same time a heavy burden for the whole of society. We now have a chance to make a real difference in people’s lives. The Commission counts on your support on these legislative files that aim to further fight occupational cancer.

I was born condemned. I have been a human rights activist for 40 years. So in 2014, when I got elected to represent the Swedish Feministiskt initiative, I took on the mission of safeguarding the principles of democracy, of spreading and defending fundamental human rights, gender equality and the respect of the basic values of our EU Treaties. One of my goals with this report is to place the situation of the Roma on the political agenda and to make real, tangible change at last. The EU is at a very critical point at the moment, and the destiny of 12 million people is not a priority. This clearly goes against the values of the EU. But this neglect is not a new phenomenon. It has been going on for 800 years. And the result is that now, in 2017, the situation of the Roma people is not better than in third countries. And, as I said, following my mission, I want to fight against injustice and inequality. This is not an easy task. The last time we had a debate on Roma issues in this Chamber in April, three MEPs took the opportunity to spread hate speech. And, although we have strengthened the Rules of Procedure of the European Parliament, the President of the European Parliament failed to react, failed to condemn and sanction hate speech. I was not very surprised. Roma people have been neglected, discriminated against, stigmatised, excluded and dehumanised for 800 years. We have never been good enough for European societies to accept us as equal citizens with guaranteed equal access to our fundamental human rights. The result is clear to see in all the shocking reports of the EU Agency for Fundamental Rights and NGOs. Anti-Gypsyism, the specific form of racism directed against the Roma, was first recognised in the European Parliament in 2015 through our resolution. Anti-Gypsyism, however unconscious it might be, can be revealed in the EU acquis as well, which often fails to take into consideration the realities and challenges of Roma, who are unable to enjoy the same rights and opportunities and the same level of protection as other EU citizens. Until we manage to remedy anti-Gypsyism, the root cause of the unacceptable situation that Roma are still facing in Europe in 2017, we will not see any improvement, even if the European Commission initiates good programmes. Is there a need to improve this situation? Yes. Is there a way to improve this situation? Yes. Is there a way out of mistrust from both sides? Yes, of course there is. My report, which has been the first European Parliament report addressing anti-Gypsyism on a wide scale, lists 12 pages of demands and recommendations, of which I will only mention a few. We demand the setting up of truth and reconciliation commissions at Member State and EU-level to acknowledge the persecution, exclusion and disownment of Roma throughout the centuries: to document these in an official white paper and to make the history of Roma part of the curricula in schools, which is crucial for creating trust. We deplore the violation of the right of Roma to free movement. We also call on the Member States of origin to take their responsibility to combat poverty and exclusion of all their citizens, and on the Member States of arrival to increase cooperation across borders to combat discrimination and exploitation and prevent exclusion continuing in the country of arrival. We demand active, meaningful participation for Roma at all levels. We call on the Court of Auditors to check the performance of EU programmes, as they seem to fail to reach out to the most disadvantaged. We call for compensation for Roma women having been subject to forced sterilisation. We call for the continuation of an improved EU framework for national Roma integration strategies after 2020. We call on the Commission for the introduction of anti-discrimination indicators in the field of education, employment, housing and health, as anti-Gypsyism undermines the successful implementation of the national Roma strategies. And we call on the Commission to treat anti-Gypsyism as a horizontal issue and develop an inventory of practical steps to combat anti-Gypsyism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 346, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Cecilia MALMSTRÖM", "mepid": "4273", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur and Parliament for the continued support to the Roma integration process. The 2011 resolution of the European Parliament played a key role in the launching of the EU framework for national Roma integration strategies up to 2020. Today, I particularly want to thank Soraya Post for her relentless and tireless work in this field – not only in this report, but for the work you do in general.  This report, as the rapporteur says, rightly highlights anti-Gypsyism, which is being felt in our society through anti-Roma hate speech, growing terms of segregation and forced evictions. Anti-Gypsyism and socioeconomic exclusion go hand in hand, so we must tackle these together. Many parts of the report confirm the conclusions we also made in the mid-term review – improvements in education, this is key of course. Fewer Roma leave school early and more Roma children participate today in early childhood education. However, segregation in education has persisted, and the situation has deteriorated. In several Member States, the majority of Roma children attend classes where most – or almost all – classmates are Roma. Educating Roma children in segregated settings prevent them from equal chances to participate in later higher quality education and from gaining access to the labour market, and this is why the Commission launched infringements: to ensure effective, equal access for Roma to a quality, inclusive, mainstream education.  I am also grateful that the report recognises existing efforts and calls for continued action from the Commission’s side in several areas. For instance, it explicitly calls for the extension of the Joint Programme on Access to Justice for Roma and Traveller Women, piloted since last year in five Member States by the Commission and the Council of Europe. The aim is to empower Roma women, improve their access to justice and fight the multi—faceted discrimination that they encounter. These are all priority areas highlighted by the report.  The report’s call for setting up a truth and reconciliation commission is welcome. These bodies, focusing on national histories and engaging directly with societies, are of course best placed at national level. This process should be Roma-led, with the involvement of other stakeholders as well. Thus, and given its mandate, the newly set—up European Roma Institute of Arts and Culture could be well positioned, rather than the Commission playing a leading role in this process, and we are of course ready to support this.  There are many very valuable proposals in this report. We would like to thank again the rapporteur and the Committee for the work that you have done, and we look forward to the discussion.

In the Gender Equality Committee, we want to see targeted efforts to strengthen the rights and situation of Roma women, and that is an important part of the political response to fighting anti-Gypsyism. We want to see investments in good health care, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights, good abortion care, good contraception, good maternity care. It should be a matter of course, but it is not today. Children should have the right to schooling, also when they travel around and when they work in Sweden, for example.

The essence of this report is to try to introduce a new approach to Roma policies so far. For years and decades, the issue of Roma integration has been on the agenda of almost every Member State. Different approaches, insights, ideas, strategies have come to light, but unfortunately no breakthrough has occurred in the issue. We must say that raising the issue to a European level has not brought the hope that has been placed in it so far, although it must be admitted that progress has been made and without it the situation would be even worse. The essence of the current report is that it focuses on anti-Gypsyism as a phenomenon. As long as we fight this phenomenon and take measures that will be positive in the areas of housing, employment and health, as well as education, there is a chance that we will be able to get out of the current situation. This is because when anti-Roma sentiment is deeply ingrained in the strata of society, it is very difficult to move forward in other areas as well.

We are having a very important debate today. Roma and Sinti are the largest ethnic minority in Europe - 20 million live in all Member States. So you are the only pan-European minority. Many Member States have fewer inhabitants. Roma have been discriminated against for many generations. During the Nazi era you were exposed to a cruel Holocaust about which far too little is talked about. Not least because of this, Europe has a political obligation towards this ethnic group. The Charter of Fundamental Rights in particular obliges us to stand up against all forms of discrimination and degradation. The Soraya Post report is a very important contribution because it takes a holistic approach and places the task of integrating the Roma under the primacy of fundamental rights. Yes, it is about much more than just social policy measures, for which sufficient funds must be made available in an efficient manner. It is about an inclusive approach that treats the Roma as an important and equal part of the population - without discrimination. It is therefore also reprehensible to play Roma against the so-called indigenous poor. Anyone who needs help is in need of help, be it access to the labor market, education or looking for a place to live. The same principles apply to everyone.

But I understand this also because I met this community of people in Slovakia and I was able to work actively with it. And I also saw various interesting things. I must emphasize at this point that we are all equal before God in our human dignity, and therefore the position of the Roma in Europe, as well as their involvement in society, we must pay due attention and we must do much to make them work well in society. every single country, especially in our Member States.

I would also like to begin by thanking the Soraya Post for an extremely good report and also the shadow rapporteurs for their good cooperation. We have a lot to be ashamed of in Europe when it comes to how we have handled and in many cases still handle the Roma in our countries. That is why it is important that we draw attention not only to the Member States and the Commission, but also to ourselves, for the prejudices that we have learned many times since childhood. We need to understand where they come from in order to change. We must also realize that the long discrimination the Roma have been and are being subjected to has a price. The prize is primarily about us actually acknowledging what we have done and doing and apologizing for it. Restoration is essential to achieve reconciliation and to build trust. An important step would be to designate August 2 as a day of remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust and also to make amends to the survivors. There is still a lot to do in Europe and in the world. Today's debate does not solve the problems of the Roma, but it is a step towards a more inclusive and accepting Europe, where the Roma are not allowed to be treated differently and where the governments of the Member States fulfill their obligations to give all citizens equal treatment.

He is instrumentalizing, for example, the Roma to carry out a new attack on the freedom of expression of nationalist MEPs. Above all, he condemns the approach of trying to assimilate the Roma, whom he describes as \"paternalistic\".

It is important to recall the centuries of segregation and prejudice that have repeatedly led to violence, from pogroms to the systematic murder of Roma in extermination camps. Only through knowledge of this aspect of the past can younger generations in particular understand the responsibility of the majority to which they belong for the current state of mutual coexistence. Its most visible manifestation is the existence of excluded communities in several Member States. It is precisely the images of living in extreme poverty that feed the prejudices about the Roma, distrust and feelings of superiority among the majority. The situation is improving, but it is still not good. Poverty is hereditary. A child born in conditions of real poverty has statistically little chance of obtaining a quality education and a well-paid job. The fight against extreme poverty is therefore a basic condition for integration. This struggle is not just about the Roma, but about all those who live on the margins of society and cannot stand on their own two feet. The historical questioning of the majority's conscience in relation to the Roma should therefore be independent of practical steps to tackle poverty and social exclusion.

I'm not saying all parents because I know many families where the situation is changing. But if more than 50% of Roma children do not prepare for primary school, then they will also fail in it and drop out early. To prevent this, we have introduced compulsory pre-school education from the age of 5 this school year, and we have introduced support measures to help overcome these obstacles to the integration of disadvantaged children. We changed the legislation, increased the budget to help these children get a better start in life than their parents had. This year, the Czech government decided to renovate the place of worship of the Roma Holocaust, to buy a pigsty in Lety.

I fully support Soraya Post’s position and agree that the problems related to Roma discrimination must be addressed through a rights-based approach. We are talking about the respect of the human rights of Roma people who have been living in Europe for centuries. The EU has a responsibility to go beyond the social inclusion aspect. We need a global strategy and a transversal approach if we really want to make a difference.

Therefore, measures need to be taken to support the Roma, to combat discrimination, to address stereotypes and to integrate. And this can be done mainly through education and the creation of conditions of trust. At the same time, I believe that the Roma community must also assume its own responsibilities, it must not be exploited, especially by various political parties that use them only for elections, in order to get votes.

However, the Commission is intervening in these matters in a number of ways. Among other things, by allocating and disbursing European funds for this purpose. However, the money that - the European money that the Member States use for the sake of Roma integration, for the catching up of the Roma - very often fails.

The Commission supports the creation and development of national Roma platforms to ensure the inclusive involvement of stakeholders in both implementation and in monitoring. As you know, this year we launched the Roma civil monitor project and it is supposed to promote civil society capacity building. Today, over 90 NGOs are involved. Roma participation here is, of course, a key element. We also support the efforts of the European Parliament and the proposal in the report to commemorate the Roma Holocaust, and we have called upon Member States to commemorate this on 2 August. As you know, the Commission has participated in several events on 2 August, but also 27 January, which is Holocaust Memorial Day, in order to commemorate the victims of the Roma Holocaust, and I think that would be a good thing. Lately, efforts have been made to try to improve the effectiveness of the different funds with increased Roma participation, as well as increased efforts to make sure that they reach the intended recipients and to fight fraud in this regard. As you know, we have a variety of legal tools to fight discrimination and hate speech, and we will continue to do so. These are good, they are very good. We will continue to open infringement proceedings against those countries which discriminate, for instance, against Roma children in education. We had a few other cases as well that we are looking at and we will continue to do so. That is the role of the Commission and we will take that role very seriously. So, we have tools of many kinds, but as Ms Post correctly says, legal tools, laws, all that is important, but what is most important is people’s attitudes. So we need to keep on fighting hate speech and pure discrimination of course, that goes without saying. But what is also very important is awareness-raising, information, education, inclusion and measures to prevent daily prejudices and the stereotypes that also lead to hate speech and hate crime. In this fight there are a lot of things to do, but I think the report is a very important tool, and I want to thank Ms Post for the work that she has done.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 369, "date": "2017-10-24.json", "name": "Soraya POST", "mepid": "124997", "text": "   rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to thank all colleagues for their comments and for all their dedicated work.

In the Czech Republic, just over 5,000 citizens registered as Roma in 2010, while approximately 500 Roma children studied in special education. Paragraph 20 of the report calls on Member States to address migration bias against Roma refugees and asylum seekers from the Western Balkans, many of whom are Roma, which may be related to specific factors affecting the local Roma community. Point 21 expresses deep concern at the number of stateless Roma in Europe. The author completely ignores the existence of tens of thousands of non-citizens in Latvia and Estonia. Paragraph 29 calls on Member States to set up hate crime units within the police force.
