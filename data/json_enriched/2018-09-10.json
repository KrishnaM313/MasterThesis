I would like to mention first of all the violent fires in Greece in July, which killed more than ninety people and injured more than two hundred. The fire has also destroyed over a thousand homes and caused enormous environmental and economic damage. Sweden, too, has been the victim of an unprecedented number of devastating fires over the same period, due, among other things, to the high temperatures recorded. Yet another proof of the extent of climate change and the damage caused by global warming. I would like to stress, however, that, thanks to the European civil protection mechanism, it has been possible to support the efforts of the national authorities with firefighters, aircraft and helicopters made available by many countries of the Union. It is an example of concrete solidarity which illustrates the added value of the European Union. Italy, my country, also experienced a dramatic Month of August, with the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa on 14 August, which left 43 people dead and hundreds of families deprived of their homes. I hope that, on the one hand, the administrative and political responsibilities of this serious disaster will be accepted and, on the other hand, that we will be able to proceed quickly with the reconstruction of this structure, which is a fundamental point of passage for the city of Genoa, its port, Italy and the whole of Europe. Genoa is in fact a hub of the European TEN-T networks. That is why the European Union is making available resources for infrastructure of European importance which, together with the Union's regional funds and the European Investment Fund, can be used to improve the city's infrastructure. Unfortunately, a few days after the tragedy of Genoa, also in Italy, a flood of the Raganello stream overwhelmed and killed ten people in the Calabrian province of Cosenza. This sudden flood has also injured many. I hope that the resources that the European Union makes available to the regions can be used to secure tourist sites exposed to natural risks. I would like to express the European Parliament's condolences and our closeness to the families of all the victims of the events that have taken place in Europe in recent months. I would therefore ask you to observe a minute's silence and recollection in order to remember the innocent victims.

A tweet in which I expressed my position on the signing by President Juncker of the JEFTA (EU-Japan Economic Partnership Agreement) without the European Parliament having been consulted beforehand.

It is certain that we have all seen these images and descriptions and, due to respect for the memory of the victims, I will not repeat them. But the circumstances and causes of this tragedy, apart from many questions, also create feelings of indignation and despair. For these reasons, and as a small sign of healthy reflexes of solidarity and expression of support on the part of the European Parliament, to all those who are experiencing the tragedy of their lost people and their damaged property, I asked the day after the fires for a debate and a resolution to be included on the plenary agenda. Since Mr Marias, as the representative of a larger group, has preceded him, I support his proposal and call on colleagues to vote in favour of the request. Ladies and gentlemen, your positive response will be the best memorial service in memory of the victims.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 16, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, what several colleagues have said is very true: we had a terrible fire in Greece which cost the lives of so many people.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has We are now talking about the European Solidarity Corps. It was a very good proposal from the Commission to give young people in the European Union and beyond more opportunities to volunteer, to show solidarity and, overall, to increase solidarity in the European Union. I was very pleased that I was rapporteur, because this is really a new flagship programme, and that is a very positive approach. Not all European Union programmes are considered to be that way. We in Parliament – and this is particularly important to me, as it is also part of our cooperation – have improved this proposal. After all, we have clearly defined what volunteering, volunteering and volunteering really mean. They exist in the social field, in working with refugees, in cultural work, when you support the elderly, or if you are committed to the climate crisis and many more. So it is a great opportunity for young people between the ages of 18 and 30 to do something for themselves by being in other countries, learning languages, getting to know the local conditions, being there in the local communities – that is, being able to develop themselves, in other words, a humanistic approach to education – and at the same time doing something for the community and for the associations. , for the institutions in which they are, by helping other people, because they are convinced that solidarity activities are really good. And then we really made a second point clear: we do not want other companies to kill their jobs afterwards to use this tool. So there should be no abuse. There has also been a very clear clarification. But there should be a small proportion of the new budget, including job opportunities, but definitely not abuse. No young person should suffer from the fact that there is public or European money here and that companies benefit from it.  Then we put a clear focus on disadvantaged young people and, above all, on rural areas. We also know here, among our interns, that the young people who arrive here are usually those who already have a big horizon, who can speak several languages, who have a great education, who are travelling internationally. But not all young people in the European Union are doing this. That is why we must give young people in rural areas or in rural areas, in smaller towns, the opportunity to benefit from these great European offers.  Then, in a fierce dispute with the Council, we managed to get so-called fresh money. This is money that the Member States would otherwise have received back from the European budget, and they have now released it in the order of EUR 75 million, that there is additional money. These are not huge sums, of course, but it is an entry into a new programme that will inspire young people. Even now, a great many people have shown interest. There are new digital application options. But it is also important to me: disadvantaged young people in particular need personal contacts. It's not just digital. You need relationships with people who care about these young people. That is why we have laid this out in our proposal for this European Solidarity Corps. I find it interesting now, politically, that criticism is being voiced from the far left and from the far right. For some it is too European, for others it is somehow not social enough. But the pro-European forces here in this House were very united in favour of this new programme. I would also like to thank all those who have worked with me, especially colleagues, on this programme. It was a great cooperation. Thank you very much! I hope it really will be a great program for young people.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has been an honour to contribute personally to the creation of the European Solidarity Corps, together with Mrs Trüpel and all my colleagues. It has certainly been months of intensive negotiations with the Council and with colleagues from all the political groups. However, I am proud of the result achieved, because it demonstrates Europe's ability to propose concrete and innovative solutions to the challenges of the present. The European Solidarity Corps will enable thousands of girls and boys to put themselves at the service of the people they need most and for the common good. A platform, therefore, for voluntary actions, internships, jobs. I am sure it will be a success, because it is with the energy and enthusiasm of young people that we can succeed in building a better, fairer, more supportive Europe. We will not be poisoned by the hatred and intolerance that imbue the words and actions of xenophobic and nationalist forces. We will not fall into the trap of those who want to dismantle more than half a century of exchanges between our countries, exchanges first of all cultural, human, values – the opposite of a programme – and ideas based on hatred between people and the fight against an idea of a Europe of solidarity, the idea of politicians whom we unfortunately also know in my country, such as Minister Salvini. It is precisely on opposing human and cultural values that the European Solidarity Corps is based, which now requires the involvement of all European, national, social and institutional actors in order to maximise its impact. From the earliest stages of the debate, I have fought for the programme to remain as inclusive as possible, enabling all young Europeans to be able to take part, regardless of their country of origin, their personal needs, their family economic status, with particular attention to young people with disabilities. It was essential to guarantee the principles of equal opportunities, compliance with criteria on the quality of the offers given, the possibility of combining a voluntary path – central to the programme – with a series of measures for work, with adequate remuneration and guaranteed contractual conditions. This so-called employment strand of the programme will make it possible to create partnerships with various socio-economic actors, such as small and medium-sized enterprises, chambers of commerce, social enterprises and cooperatives, while broadening the range of possible actions within it. It was necessary to separate voluntary actions from work better than the Commission's initial proposal, and I believe that work should always be regarded as such, and therefore paid for as such. The text that we will be adopting tomorrow provides important guarantees in this respect. I am pleased to see my proposals becoming part of the new programme. I would therefore like the European Solidarity Corps to prove capable of becoming a powerful means of social cohesion, including intergenerational cohesion, an instrument which, together with Erasmus and the Social Fund, will be able to help the many organisations that are fighting to do good where it is most needed, especially many youth organisations. An instrument, for example, which, in tragic situations, such as the collapse of the Morandi bridge in Genoa, which we mentioned just today, will make it possible to activate girls and boys from all over Europe who want to roll up their sleeves to help, as was already done in the experimental phase also in Norcia. In short, a tangible example of a Europe of solidarity.

I want to express my thanks for the great dedication with which Parliament has handled this file. My particular thanks go to the rapporteur, Ms Trüpel, and her shadow rapporteurs. For the Commission, the proposal to create a European Solidarity Corps is a major component of our commitment to invest in young people. Together with Erasmus+ the Solidarity Corps will be instrumental in creating new opportunities for young people – opportunities to learn, to engage for causes important to them, to support others and to help us build a resilient cohesive Europe for the future. Most importantly, the European Solidarity Corps can offer young people the chance to experience what it feels like to be European. At a time of rising discord and widening cultural gaps between countries and even within communities, this is more important than ever. The Solidarity Corps also shows how Europe can act and take responsibility. Together with Parliament and Council we have moved swiftly to make it a reality. Now we have the duty not to disappoint the many young people who have come forward to join the Corps. More than 75 000 young people have already registered in the European Solidarity Corps portal and over 8 000 have started their activities on the ground, and the numbers keep rising. With the new regulation, and the budget which goes with it, we will be able to offer solidarity opportunities to 100 000 young people by 2020. But the new regulation you will be voting on tomorrow only covers the years up to 2020. Sending a strong signal to Europe’s young people, the Commission has proposed to strengthen and further expand the European Solidarity Corps in the next long-term EU budget from 2021 to 2027. We want to consolidate and build on what we already have during this period, with one important novelty: we propose to also support volunteering for humanitarian aid operations. This can be the start of creating a truly global volunteering community. The European Solidarity Corps is a flagship project for Europe’s youth. It therefore needs ambitious funding. That is why we have proposed to raise the budget to EUR 1.26 billion over the seven years. This will enable us to offer 350 000 solidarity opportunities by 2027. I count on the support of this House, and especially of the rapporteur, Ms Šojdrová. Let us work together to make sure we find a swift agreement on how to develop the Corps for the future. Young people have a crucial role in building the future. With next year’s European Parliament elections coming closer, further strengthening the European Solidarity Corps will send an important signal that we are putting that future in their hands.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Since the creation of the European Voluntary Service 22 years ago, one hundred thousand Europeans have participated in this programme. The European Voluntary Service is now to become even more attractive, and we have the ambitious objective of adding another hundred thousand participants, and I think that is a good ambition that we have.  For us as the S&amp;D Group, it was important that we defend the non-profit principle of this program in order to ensure the charitable nature of the activities. It was also important to make a clear distinction between voluntary commitment and professional work in order to prevent the use of voluntary service in order to displace jobs. As the S&amp;D Group, it was particularly important to us that the money for this programme is indeed fresh money, and it is good that we have managed to get at least twenty per cent fresh money, that there is transparency in the reallocation of funds and that there is no negative impact on other programmes and funds, such as the Erasmus+ programme.  With regard to funding and as a member of the Committee on Budgets, however, I must also make it quite clear at this point that, unfortunately, it has become apparent that the Member States are not prepared to actually provide fresh, new money for new projects. In my view, the Council and the Commission have also acted somewhat irresponsibly in this project, which is so important for young Europeans. It is simply not acceptable for the Council to publicly announce that there is a new programme and then not to provide the money for it! The Commission, too, has not been completely tarnished with glory. It has developed the new programme, but has not ensured that the funding of this programme does not jeopardise other existing programmes.

It is, in part, a response to the outpouring of compassion shown by many young people in response to numerous natural disasters, such as devastating floods in my region, and to the refugee crisis. The initiative is a unique chance to strengthen the European dimension of volunteering, hopefully enabling exchange of best practices among Member States and encouraging wider promotion of active participation and volunteering at national level.  However, I must take this opportunity to reaffirm the key role of citizenship, education and active participation of young – and less young – people more generally, and the importance of properly supporting all relevant initiatives in this field through the next EU budget. Citizenship, education and active participation facilitate intercultural dialogue, and promote personal and collective development and wellbeing and empowerment of individuals and communities. We must prepare a generation of young people with the motivation, commitments and skills, including critical and creative thinking, so that they can be audacious problem solvers and responsible citizens in a more fair and inclusive world. Following the Charlie Hebdo and Danish attacks in 2015, the 28 EU Education Ministers signed the Paris Declaration calling for the use of education and active participation to promote fundamental values. I was proud to be given the responsibility of writing a report for Parliament’s Committee on Culture and Education on this topic, making many concrete recommendations. We now have a historic opportunity to implement these recommendations and provide citizenship initiatives with proper funding.

In his State of the Union speech two years ago, Mr Juncker admitted the EU was at a low ebb and sprayed around half-baked ideas for new programmes in the manner of an out-of-control machine gun. Two years on, one would have hoped that cooler heads would have prevailed, because this is a knee-jerk idea that will not achieve the purpose for which it was devised, which is boosting levels of European consciousness in member nations. But it certainly will risk unfairly crowding out the many excellent youth volunteer schemes that already exist within those nations, and at a cost to European taxpayers running into hundreds of millions of euros. In my own country, the National Citizen Service and the world-renowned Duke of Edinburgh Award Scheme stand to suffer unfair EU-subsidised competition. Perhaps one could coin the phrase ‘solidarity dumping’ to describe the phenomenon. I would also like to sound a note of caution about one of the main activities that was envisaged for this scheme, namely to have young, idealistic Europeans working to assist newly-arrived asylum seekers, who are overwhelmingly young men from societies riddled with violence and in which core European values such as gender equality are not well observed. The risks entailed in having untrained European teenagers working in proximity with often traumatised new arrivals should be obvious. Another weakness of the Corps is that it threatens entirely to smother two pre-existing smaller schemes, namely the European Voluntary Service, and EU Aid Volunteers. In the autumn of 2016, a Commission that felt humiliated by the Brexit vote and alarmed by a public backlash against its approach on immigration and asylum, decided to make up programmes on the hoof. It would actually send out a message that Mr Juncker has calmed himself and is no longer in such a blind panic were he now to pull the plug on this folly. After all, polling evidence indicates that it’s not starry-eyed school-leavers who have lost faith in the EU, but rather their more experienced and worldly-wise parents after many years of suffering Commission power grabs that undermine their quality of life, particularly in the fields of monetary policy and migration.

Finally, there is also a need for further training in character. This is the case when you have to fight your way through difficult situations. Another aspect: career promotion. Here, too, a differentiated approach must be taken. EU-subsidised wages must not lead to volunteers being used as a free substitute for regular workers.

Dear Mrs Rapportőr, dear Fellow Members, We are not anti-European, we are opposed to the United States of Europe plan. We love Europe very much, we love European values, but we believe in a Europe of nations, and we love and value European values so much that we defend them.

That is what the European Solidarity Corps is all about. I do not know why there should be such concern that it is contrary to young people’s interests, or something like that.

In fact, it is the other way round. As we heard, there is 20% fresh money, so it’s about additional possibilities for young people and, as I said before, especially disadvantaged youngsters. I think this programme represents a very good combination: giving more possibilities to young people in Europe and beyond, with more money and more opportunities for self-development, and at the same time more opportunities to serve their communities in very different fields. This will be another flagship programme, I hope, alongside Erasmus+. So it is not a matter of contradiction or of competition; no, it’s the other way round. It’s really a win-win situation. It is very interesting for me, from a political perspective, to hear the arguments against. To the Brexiteers and Ms Morvai I would say that I know, to some extent, you cannot think in terms of supranational democracy. You think that democracy works only in a nation state but, you know, the European Union, for decades has now, has proved that there is a very good combination of local, regional, national and supranational democracy, and that is what I will defend because that is the future. Believe me, we have had such a bad history with nationalism all over Europe and we should not go back to this bad sort of nationalism. Yet when I listen to you, you are so filled with hate and resentment. When young people work with refugees, it is a very good contribution to solidarity. This is not about mass immigration and so on: it’s about solidarity and being responsible for people who are poor, who are in need. The fact that young people are ready to do that, and that we enable them to do it and to develop their capacities, reflects a good European attitude.

But in this time of universal technological progress, in which the whole world, including its most underdeveloped parts, is richer than ever, in Europe we should have been much easier to overcome the initial inequalities. Unfortunately, this did not happen or happen slowly. Because less developed members did not possess precious know-how at the beginning of their European path, and some of them did not understand the importance of structural reforms. Today, as Members of the Union, they use various mechanisms to gather the knowledge needed for reforms, but the reform processes themselves often have nowhere to finance. Any real reform saves money in the long run because it makes processes faster, employees more efficient and educated, and services to citizens better, but its implementation costs money. This is why this structural reform support programme is extremely important.  Increasing the financial envelope from €142.8 to a total of as much as €300 million is a guarantee that the programme will be able to support the reform efforts of each Requesting Member State. This is particularly important in the context of the new recession that our economies will face in the near future. There is no better preparation for the crisis than structural reforms, and that is why we must support members in their efforts to implement them, and where awareness does not exist we need to make additional efforts. When it comes to the new recession, which is a normal part of any business cycle, it is important to note that we have also amended Article 4 by including support to prepare for access to the euro area among the objectives of the Programme. This will ensure that all members wishing to join the euro meet all the criteria and are more resilient to the crisis in order to avoid some of the difficult scenarios we witnessed in the last recession. My personal priority when working on this report was to ensure that the increase in the financial envelope was not done to the detriment of cohesion policy, which is already under great fire. Cohesion Policy is a key mechanism for strengthening the capacity of less developed countries and reducing disparities between member states and we must preserve it in its current form. I am satisfied with the solution reached that an increase of up to €222.8 million is achieved through the use of flexibility instruments, while a further 77.2 million can be achieved through the transfer of funds from the budget for technical assistance at the request of member states. Another aspect of this proposal that I must highlight is the involvement of the local community in the implementation of reforms. In accordance with the constitutional and administrative organisation of a Member State, local and regional authorities should be involved in the reform process. I think this is very important so that reforms are tailor-made for people, not bureaucracy, and that funding them would be as transparent as possible. Since October this year is the deadline for submitting projects that should be financed from the Programme in 2019, I have personally engaged to inform stakeholders from Croatia. I encourage, of course, everyone else to conduct a comprehensive outreach campaign for all stakeholders as soon as possible so that the funds are fully used. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all my colleagues who have contributed through their work on the committees to this report and all those who will support it in the vote.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 59, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, structural reforms are crucial to modernise our economies, strengthen their performance and resilience and foster real convergence within and across Member States. The crisis has shown that given the high level of integration of EU economies, reform efforts are a matter of common concern. Your vote tomorrow will be a signal that we stand by Member States in these efforts, and it will be an important step in finalising the package of proposals for deepening economic and monetary union. Structural reforms not only create an environment that is conducive to investment growth and job creation, they can also help EU economies withstand shocks and contribute to economic and social cohesion. This is why structural reforms are important building blocks for a more resilient economic and monetary union. Since May 2017 we have been supporting the design and implementation of structural reforms in Member States through the structural reforms support programme (SRSP). This has proven its usefulness, judging from the number of requests from Member States which significantly exceeded the current budget possibilities. This year 24 Member States applied for an amount that was five times the available budget. To respond to the growing demand from Member States we need to increase the funding. At the same time, to strengthen the euro it will be beneficial to provide targeted support to those Member States wishing to adopt the euro, in order to help them to prepare better and facilitate their smooth participation in economic and monetary union. This is why on 6 December 2017 we proposed to increase the budget of SRSP by EUR 80 million. Throughout the legislative process both the Parliament and the Council have shown a clear commitment to EU support for structural reforms in the Member States. The compromise that we found is a good one. Half of the increase of EUR 80 million will be funded by the global margin for commitments, the other half will be funded through redeployment available from Heading 2, not affecting the rural and development programmes, nor technical assistance. This means that we are fully respecting the commitment from the original SRSP regulation not to provide further financing for the programme at the expense of cohesion policy. I want to thank the European Parliament, the rapporteur Ms Tomašić, the shadow rapporteurs, and the committee chair, Ms Mihaylova, for the hard work and constructive efforts during the trilogue negotiations.

Just one and a half years ago in May 2017, we adopted the Structural Reform Support Programme for 2017 to 2020. Back then, one of the main points of critique of this House was the financing of the programme from the Cohesion Policy envelope. Structural reforms are a very wide subject. In the past, they have been used for many different things and many different things have been called structural reforms. The aim of cohesion policy however, and the aim of cohesion money thus, is actually pretty well defined. It means to strengthen economic and social cohesion by reducing disparities in the level of development between regions. Now, nearly one and a half years later, we need to amend the SRSP. But again, no fresh money is being mobilised from the EU budget to fill the financing gap. Instead, again, redeployment shall fix this. This time, up to EUR 40 million from heading two – so money foreseen for agriculture and natural resources – shall be redeployed. This is not acceptable for my group. Additionally, the outcome of the negotiation leaves one important question unanswered: if money is short, which requests should get support of the programme? We proposed some pretty clear criteria to make the process more transparent, but the compromise in the outcome is rather meaningless and actually leaves a lot of discretion to the Commission to arbitrarily make a choice among the requests for support from the Member States.

But there are also Interreg, and the PEACE Programme and these can – and should – remain, whatever happens post—2020. Prior to drafting my report, we took a REGI delegation to Northern Ireland. It was a good and interesting delegation. We saw Interreg cross-border projects in Derry—Londonderry, for example health projects where people cross the border to receive health care. We also met and talked to businesses who benefited from cross—border operations. So it brings social and economic benefits. In Belfast we met the Survivor and Victim Support Project and we heard about the excellent work they were doing, and we saw and heard from two community projects funded by the PEACE Programme. Let me remind colleagues that the PEACE Programme in the current round received EUR 270 million. We saw two centres where people – mainly young people – from both communities came together to learn, to dance, to sing, to enjoy themselves, to play sport and to socialise together. I believe that projects like these are vital if we are to continue to break down mistrust, particularly amongst future generations. I think one of the reasons why this type of project has been so successful is because it has used a bottom-up approach, where people from communities have come together and done things together to benefit them as individuals and to benefit their communities. Another thing we learned on our delegation was that EU funds are seen as neutral. That kept coming up time after time. So EU funds are accepted because they don’t come from the UK, they don’t come from the Irish Government, they come from the European Union. As I said, this means all communities have accepted EU funding and have put that funding to good use. That is why one of the key findings of this report is that the PEACE Programme and Interreg must continue post—2020, whatever happens. Another key recommendation in our report is that the PEACE Programme can be used as a model and used elsewhere where there has been conflict and where there has been mistrust. So we are looking to the future here to say that cohesion policy should continue and this would be another good use for it. I believe that this is a good report. There have been lots of discussions in the REGI Committee and it has had good support in the REGI Committee. So please, colleagues, let’s send a message to the European Union, to the Irish Government and, in particular, to the UK Government, that Interreg and, in particular, the PEACE Programme are so important. We must continue to fund them post—2020, whatever happens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 79, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first and foremost, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Mr Vaughan on his report. I believe it brings an accurate and some much—needed light to the decisive impact that cohesion policy has had in Northern Ireland. I had the pleasure back in November of attending an exhibition hosted by the European Parliament on peace and Interreg (European Territorial Co—operation) projects and I have also had the opportunity over the last four years to meet several beneficiaries, and what I witnessed through their stories was a vivid and concrete expression of what cohesion policy can help us to achieve. As you said, EU investments have helped bring people close together and increased the prosperity of Northern Ireland and its citizens, but most importantly, they have contributed to the economic transformation of a region that was facing many complex challenges. I think it is quite obvious that over the past 20 years, EU funding for Northern Ireland has been both substantial in size and successful in its implementation. This includes bespoke actions and investments from all European structural and investment funds. The ERDF – European Regional Development Fund – alone has provided over EUR 1 billion through regional growth programmes for Northern Ireland. In addition, Northern Ireland and the border region of Ireland benefited from over EUR 2 billion through peace and Interreg funding. Honourable Members, I am particularly pleased to hear from you that the Regional Development Committee’s fact—finding mission to Northern Ireland was enriching and confirmed that the programmes were delivering efficiently on the ground. Whether we are talking about funding the science park in Derry/Londonderry, thus helping small-and medium-sized enterprises and micro businesses to innovate, or about supporting gross community dialogue in Belfast through urban regeneration projects, I think cohesion policy has brought a holistic approach in Northern Ireland which has been instrumental in addressing the multifaceted challenges of the region. As rightly underlined in your report, the peace and Interreg cross-border programmes have been of particular importance, and they are making a vital contribution to long-term partnership, peace and prosperity. I took good note of the report’s call for a continuation of funding for the peace and Interreg programmes after 2020 and my message to you is clear: we are on the same wavelength. You all know and we know that the Commission included in its draft cohesion policy package for the next programming period a proposal for a new peace programme – we call it the ‘peace+ programme’, combining the current peace and Ireland-Northern Ireland cross-border programme. I think this a very tangible sign of the Commission’s continuous commitment and of our firm belief that cross—border funding remains paramount for north—south cooperation in Ireland. Thank you for your attention and I am looking forward to our debate.

Almost two million citizens in Northern Ireland benefited from EUR seven billion in EU funding from 2007 to 2017. And behind these numbers, behind the statistics, there are people’s lives. People’s lives that have been changed because of EU cohesion policy. I believe this is one of the textbook examples of how EU cohesion policy is changing the environment. Moreover, this contribution has been done with cross-financing and coordination with the Peace Programme so, yet again, the European Union has shown that it knows how to work to bring back peace – and peace is priceless.

I congratulate my friend, the rapporteur, on an excellent and concise report. It is important to remember that the essence of the Good Friday Agreement is that it provides the framework that enables the different traditions in Northern Ireland to coexist peacefully. The important work reviewed in this report aims to maintain the climate in which peace can continue to evolve. Let us not forget that the Good Friday Agreement was approved of overwhelmingly by people on both sides of the Irish border. Sadly, there are some Brexiteers, like Mr Rees Mogg in the UK Parliament, who want to pick and choose which bits of democracy they respect, and they dismiss the importance of maintaining this agreement after Brexit. To dismiss the agreement is to take peace for granted, and when you take peace for granted, you are on a very slippery slope. So it is vital that the work described in this report continues, even if cohesion policy cannot be the vehicle.

And there is no doubt that European support has played an important role in terms of economic development and social cohesion. In recent years, funding from the European Regional Development Fund has supported a vast range of projects, including investment in the development of tourism as well as infrastructure projects. Many projects have benefited from the European Social Fund, helping individuals and families across Northern Ireland, supporting initiatives which have helped to increase skills and reduce economic inactivity. The Peace Programme has supported several big-ticket projects as well but, in my view, the greatest impact is the role it has played on the ground and in communities. So I welcome the fact that the report recognises the important contribution these funds have made to Northern Ireland and I very much agree with the rapporteur and his comments on the bottom-up approach. Can I also say that, since the referendum result, my party has been very clear: we do not want support of this kind to be disrupted or diminished as a result of Brexit. However, I have to say I am more than disappointed by the report’s suggestion that without these funds the peace process would be put at risk. To me, this is overly simplistic at best, and at worst it risks giving a potential excuse to those who seek to justify terrorism. I have to ask a question here, maybe to the rapporteur and maybe to the Commissioner. If we decide, or if it is decided, to give funds to Northern Ireland after 2020, and the United Kingdom is no longer part of the European Union and there will be no MEPs from Northern Ireland within the Chamber, who is actually going to represent Northern Ireland? The UK will not be at the Council table, there will be no Commissioner from the United Kingdom, and there will be no MEPs in this House, so that is a very difficult road to go down. It is an interesting road that needs to be addressed, and it is one I have certainly given some thought to, so it will be very interesting to see how the Commission and the Council actually deal with that problem.

I don’t want to go back to how things were before. I cannot do that.

She told us about her experiences, about her life, about the history of the place where she grew up. She told us about the violence, the division, the economic devastation. She didn’t have any political agenda. She probably didn’t even have a strong opinion about the European Union. All that she wanted us to know was her story and for her story to be taken into consideration when we take decisions here in the European Parliament. When we went to Northern Ireland, with a delegation from this Parliament, no matter where we went, no matter whom we talked to, the message was always very similar. The peace funding has played an integral role to build peace in a conflict-ridden area in Europe, not only to rebuild infrastructure and the economy, but also to bring people together who had been segregated and separated for decades. Peace is very hard to build and very easy to destroy. As Europeans we have learnt this lesson over and over again in the past centuries.

After all, the Commissioner has done a great lot, I would like to commend her in this area, and there should be a place for those cross-border funds in the new programming period, because it is these programmes that are supposed to show us how cross-border cooperation can be built, and I think this is particularly important for the Balkans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 90, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Izaskun BILBAO BARANDICA", "mepid": "96922", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to express my full support for the continuity in Northern Ireland of cohesion programmes and especially the PEACE programme, which is fundamental to the consolidation of the peace process outside the Good Friday Agreement.

This also means that the implementation of programmes has been successful overall. In particular, the Peace and Interreg (European Territorial Cooperation) projects have demonstrated that cross-border cooperation is not an abstract concept: it is part of the daily life of citizens and it provides a space for people to come together and forge new partnerships. I liked very much what you said – that peace is very easy to destroy, but very hard to build, and we should not take it for granted. I thank you very much for all your interventions. We will have the opportunity later today during the debate on Mr Hetman’s report to discuss further the importance of ensuring strong cohesion in border regions, but we have here a first taste with Northern Ireland. It is undoubtedly one of the most telling examples of what cohesion policy has helped to achieve in border regions and beyond. There are countless examples where European funding has made a real difference to citizens, businesses, researchers, schools and local and regional authorities, and this report recognises that cohesion policy is one of the keys that can unlock our social, economic and cultural transformation. We must strive to defend it, and make every effort to further increase its effectiveness. This is why, as I said, the Commission has proposed a balanced budget beyond 2020 which preserves cohesion policy as a policy which is both strong and for all the regions.  I trust that the findings in your report will underpin your reflection on the future of cohesion policy and that you will give the negotiation of the legislative packages the highest priority so that a new legislative framework can be adopted a soon as possible. This is together with the negotiation of the MFF. We will also respond to the question from Mr Nicholson on how this peace+ programme will be implemented in the future.

First of all, I would like to thank colleagues for their positive comments right across the Chamber, although I think one or two colleagues didn’t quite get the e—mail about what this report is supposed to be about and what it is not supposed to be about. But I think, in general, the comments were very, very welcome. I particularly welcome the comments from Mr Nicholson and the question he raised, and I think you, Commissioner, partly answered that. We need to look at what Member States – and particularly, maybe, the Irish Government – are saying about how EU funds are administered in the future and how Northern Ireland is represented in those discussions. I also welcomed his comments when he said that Northern Ireland has come a long way. There has been huge economic improvement and tensions have been reduced, but we do know that those tensions still bubble away. When we were there on the delegations, one of the things we were told was that some survey work had been done and since the referendum, attitudes have hardened amongst the community. So I hope nobody gets the impression – and they should not get the view from the report – that no EU funds means a return to troubles. The report isn’t saying that, and I wouldn’t say that, but what I am saying – and what I think the report says – is that the EU funds have made a valuable contribution to reducing those tensions and conflicts. So I think that is the important point in terms of Mr Nicholson’s view. Therefore EU funds should continue in the future. We should continue to fund Interreg and the PEACE Programme. We have seen for ourselves on our delegation how welcome those funds are and how important those funds are for making a contribution to communities. Whatever happens in the future – deal or no deal, as Ms Anderson said – the UK Government, the Irish Government and the European Union should commit to continuing to operate and fund Interreg and the PEACE Programme. Ms Dodds is right that nothing is ever important. In the REGI Committee we spend a huge amount of time talking about bureaucracy and simplifying things so we all want to reduce bureaucracy and we also want to make things as simple as possible, particularly for users. But, overall, these funds have been good. They have delivered on the ground. As I said in my earlier contribution, one of the reasons why they have delivered on the ground is because local people themselves have owned it. They have decided how they want to spend the money. They have decided how they are going to spend the money on important things, which are going to impact on their communities. So, just to conclude, I think it is absolutely vital that these funds continue in the future.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. We all remember 2015, which was particularly painful for our Greek friends. Indeed, in the context of Greece's severe financial and economic crisis, the country was no longer able to guarantee and guarantee the necessary co-financing for the Structural Funds projects. There were simply no public funds. In concrete terms, this meant that many very important infrastructure projects in Greece, which had already begun, were about to end, and even worse: if these projects had not been completed in the 2007-2013 funding period, Greece would have had to repay significant funds to the EU. So we were faced with an absolute worst-case scenario. The situation threatened to get even worse if these payments had to be made to the EU.  It was therefore important to act very quickly, very wisely and very purposefully. The EU Commission then proposed an amendment to the general regulation of the Structural Funds: in order to allow the country to use the available funds, the EU waived the otherwise binding national co-financing share during the last funding period. This has allowed Greece to revert to investment funds that would otherwise have simply fallen into disrepair, as described above. In addition, Greece was granted an advance for the new funding period of EUR 1 billion, which has added up to an aid measure totalling around EUR 2 billion, a sum which this Parliament had to monitor in detail. As special rapporteur, I was responsible for this monitoring on behalf of Parliament and on several occasions on the ground, including in Greece, to talk to the important people there about these projects.  In this context, we in Parliament have repeatedly stressed that these aids cannot be a blank cheque. They should be tied to the implementation and completion of these important projects, including in the context of the structural reforms that Greece had to implement. That is precisely what we wanted to ensure with the report before us today. We have therefore carried out a thorough check that the EU's financial resources, this EUR 2 billion, are being used and used wisely. And what is the result? The result is that Greece has delivered. The country has drawn up and completed a list of priorities for the important projects. These could therefore be terminated on time without any deterioration in resources. Not only that, however, but this report also shows the impact that regional policy can have on regions and countries. We have seen that regional policy projects have helped to make the country grow appreciably economically, to combat high unemployment and to create prospects for people. This was a real success for Greece.  At a time of massive crisis, Structural Funds sometimes accounted for more than half of total public investment. It is estimated that this additional investment in Greece's gross domestic product in 2015 could be slightly more than two percent higher than without these funds. 131 priority projects have been completed over the whole period through these aid measures. These are clearly measurable figures. Such figures should therefore give the critics of regional policy food for thought. Regional policy has created very concrete added value here. This includes real success stories, and I would just remind you of the transport infrastructure that has been created and of important investments in the environment and tourism.  Colleagues, the Greek people have been able to be effectively helped by these special measures. Yes, these aid measures were a sign of lived solidarity. We agreed by a large majority in committee that this was and is an advertisement for the European idea and for regional policy. In the future, care must be taken to ensure that investments remain sustainable, that jobs remain secure and that the quality of life is improved.  In summary, I am convinced that the EU's decision to grant this special aid to Greece was the right decision. It is quite clear what would have happened if we had not done so.  But it also remains clear that this aid measure is and remains a special case. We must all ensure that this will not happen again, either for Greece or for any other Member State. Many thanks to the European Commission, but also to all the Members of this House who have been involved in this report with me. have cooperated and adopted these conclusions.

I want to assure you that the Commission stands by the Greek people and the public authorities and will explore all possible means of assistance in a spirit of solidarity. I understand that you voted earlier to discuss these issues separately, so we will have this opportunity later. Honourable Members, I would like to congratulate Mr Arimont on this important report. Actually, the specific measures for Greece adopted in October 2015 which we are discussing today were already a vivid expression of this spirit of solidarity, which is the DNA of cohesion policy. I would like to thank the European Parliament and, in particular, the Regional Development Committee, its chair, Ms Mihaylova, and the vice-chair, Mr Arimont, for their continued support in promoting these measures. These measures provided crucial liquidity for Greece. A total amount of approximately EUR 2 billion was paid to the country in 2015 and 2016. This includes around EUR 1 billion of additional pre—financing for the 2014-2020 programmes. Another EUR 1 billion paid as a consequence of the increase of the co-financing rate to 100% and the removal of the 95% ceiling for the total advance and interim payments for the 2007-2013 programming period. In times of severe liquidity problems, these measures also alleviated the burden on the national budget. They reduced by approximately EUR 1 billion the amounts needed in national co-financing for 2007-2013. Thanks to the additional liquidity and to the fact that it was put on a special ring-fenced account, Greece was able to restart its payments to beneficiaries of co-financing projects who, in turn, resumed work on this project, thereby initiating new expenditure which could then be reimbursed by the Commission. I note with great satisfaction that Greece managed to complete the important project in the programming period 2007-2013 in the fields of transport, digital infrastructure, entrepreneurship, the environment and social and health care. The completion of this project has triggered the virtuous circle of job creation, economic activity and growth. One of the most obvious examples is the five motorway concessions, part of the main TEN-T (Trans-European Transport Networks) network. By mid-2015, works had stopped and there was a very serious risk that they would not be resumed because of the lack of funds. The liquidity provided through the specific measures has been instrumental to ensuring that in the course of 2017, all five projects were completed. I actually had the pleasure of taking part in the inauguration event for the Tempe Valley tunnel on the Aegean motorway. All the way through the support from the European Parliament was essential, so I would like, once again, to thank you for your contribution, with particular acknowledgement to the honourable Member Arimont for having sponsored these measures and for his thorough report. Thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to your comments.

Mr President, today we are closing here an effort launched in October 2015 by the Committee on Regional Development, giving an important exception to my country, Greece, by Regulation (EU) 2015/1839. It is an important initiative, as the European Union has shown its solidarity with Greece at a very critical point. It is important because Greece lost 26% of GDP during the crisis and its unemployment soared. It is important because, in May 2018, Greece still has unemployment of 19.5% according to Eurostat and youth unemployment for 2017 was 43.7%. With the exception of Greece, Greece received a total amount of EUR 20.4 billion from cohesion policy funding for the period 2007-2013.

Today we monitor the implementation of the specific measures under Regulation (EU) 2015/1839, designed to provide Greece with support at a crucial time of liquidity shortages and lack of public investment. This is beautifully reflected in colleague Arimont's report.  I would like to emphasise here the important role of cohesion policy as the Union's main investment instrument for strengthening competitiveness, economic growth and reducing inequalities, given that the ESI Funds represent the largest source of direct investment in Greece. The REPORT of the REGI Committee invariably underlines that the Structural Funds have a significant positive impact on gross domestic product and social, economic and territorial cohesion in general.  I take this case to welcome the fact that, thanks to the European Union funds under this Regulation, the number of projects declared as incomplete has significantly decreased and the absorption of the Structural Funds has significantly improved, with Greece being the first Member State to fully absorb the available resources and reaching a 100% absorption rate for the previous period. In addition, as of March 2018, Greece showed a 28% implementation rate for the current programming period, leading it among the best performing Member States overall.

More generally, I think the specific measures in favour of Greece embody the very essence of cohesion policy, namely championing solidarity between Member States so that regions can grow together, supporting growth enhancing investments to boost the economy. This is exactly what the Commission has tried to reinforce in its post—2020 proposal for cohesion policy by securing a policy for all regions and by making sure that resources are efficiently channelled to where they are the most needed. On the other issue that was raised, I can assure you that we are standing by the Greek people and the Greek authorities – as well as the Italians – and we are working together to integrate the migrants.

However, we are not there yet. We must not abandon the Greek people. After all, youth unemployment is sky-high at 42 percent. Greek debt, at 180% of GDP, is even the highest in Europe. A debt that, through accounting tricks, will hang around the necks of the Greek people for years to go.  That is why I conclude that there is a great deal of suffering behind the figures.

Commissioner Stylianides flew to Greece in the hours following the tragedy and helped in coordinating the EU response.

The response was substantial: first, ground forest-firefighting modules and vehicles from Cyprus; second, Canadair firefighting planes from Italy and Spain and two planes from Romania were deployed; and nine Member States in total made offers. Helping countries that face forest fires was a top priority this summer for the European Union and it remains a top priority. The Commission’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre is working 24 hours a day and is in constant contact with national authorities. We stand ready to help Greece further whenever needed. With regard to the wildfires in Attica, as Commissioner for Regional Policy I was in direct contact with the Greek authorities from the moment we knew about the fires. I informed the Greek authorities that the Commission was ready to act swiftly to release the first payment as soon as possible. In addition, I highlighted the possibility, should the conditions for assistance from the European Union Solidarity Fund be met, for Greece to benefit from 95% EU co-financing towards reconstruction work supported by cohesion policy.

It is necessary to confirm here today that all available financial instruments from cohesion are at the disposal of the Region and the Greek Government in order to move very quickly to deal with the consequences in this region. The area needs to be rebuilt and re-inhabited. The Eye must be resurrected, relived with the help of the European Union. We therefore call on the European Commission to show practical solidarity with Greece, as was the case with Italy in the recent devastating earthquakes in 2016 and 2017. Greece, as you know, is a country that has suffered, for many consecutive years, a fall in gross domestic product to a total of 25%. It is therefore necessary that it should also be treated exceptionally in this case.

The specific actions we are asking the Commission for in the unprecedented tragedy have been described to you by Mrs Spyrakis. I'll look at it from another side. Ninety-eight people died in July and this was because forty-two public structures had a duty, through a tangle of tangled powers, to ensure that they did not burn. And yet, they burned. The current Greek government has not constructed this model of administration. That's why they took care of so many previous ones. He chose the wrong criteria for the chief. He made an almost offensive attempt at communication management, but the bottom line is elsewhere. Forty-two structures, by the way, were trying to provide nine firefighting services without anyone being responsible. This is the case not only in fires but also in the economy that suffers from customer circuits, in the fight against corruption, in development. We therefore ask the Greek government to make an explicit commitment that, out of the 23,143 responsibilities of the Greek services and structures, they will give 30% within a few months to unique managers.

I believe that our insistence and our constant insistence since last Tuesday that this debate should take place here has been vindicated because we owe it to the memory of our dead. I thank the House for accepting our proposal. The deadly fires in Mati highlighted the enormous timeless responsibilities of the Greek State and, at the same time, the inadequacies and incompetence of the Tsipras government. Inadequacy and incompetence that led 98 of our fellow citizens to the fiery death, over 200 injured in hospitals and thousands of homes and businesses in the disaster. No self-criticism from the government so far, when, even yesterday, at the Thessaloniki International Fair, the Prime Minister had the opportunity to say \"sorry\". And yet, since July 2017 we have called on the government to use the new natural disasters regulation that allows 5% of the European Regional Development Fund to be used for flood defence projects, for fire protection, for reforestation. The Government was deaf to our comments and also to the comments of Mrs Cređu who, on 29 November 2017, in parliament's plenary session in Brussels, asked the government to replace its strategy for dealing with natural disasters and pointed out that there were EUR 1.3 billion available to Greece to deal with these problems. This is where the enormous political responsibilities of the Tsipras government lie, and yet, instead of the Prime Minister sending the minister responsible for handling the NSRF, he upgraded him, made him interior minister. So a message must be given, the government must change policy, it must take advantage of all the opportunities that exist with the Structural Funds, it must take advantage of a new design because, in the end, the Prime Minister suddenly found EUR 500 million and set up a new Agency.

What's bothering me? Obviously we want European solidarity and obviously we will support every effort to deal with the consequences. But we had a similar fire in Portugal in 2017 and then the interior minister resigned, apologizing. We had an accident in Bulgaria with 18 dead in a car accident and three ministers resigned, apologizing for the state of the road network.

Unfortunately, however, the authorities have not taken advantage of these margins. On the contrary, they have shown criminal negligence and oligopoly. Cars were not safely regulated in the surrounding areas and, instead of evacuating the area, they sent people from Marathon Avenue to Mati, which led to such a high number of casualties.

Moreover, on the day of the disaster there was not the necessary coordination of all those responsible.

Therefore the responsibilities of the Region of Attica are enormous, as are the Municipality of Marathon.

Last year’s experience with simultaneous forest fires showed that the current EU Civil Protection Mechanism, based on voluntary offers, has reached its limit. Last year the problems were primarily in Portugal, but also at the same time in France and in other countries, and we have seen a repeat this year with simultaneous fires in Greece, Sweden and Latvia. We have been facing multiple crises in numerous countries at the same time and, as a result, our Member States cannot always provide assistance to other Member States at the crucial moment. That is precisely why the Commission proposes to strengthen its civil protection system and create the mechanism that we call RescEU. RescEU establishes at European Union level a limited number of well—defined, own-operation capacities as a safety net to be deployed in response to a request by a Member State when existing capacities are overwhelmed. What used to be considered a type of natural disaster affecting only the south of Europe is now present, as you know, in the north too, in Sweden and in Latvia. We have also had wildfires in Greenland, and this means that what has been sensed here is true: climate change is real, it is happening, it is creating new realities on the ground, and we must adapt to them. That is why, as I said, the Commission proposed a new initiative last November to strengthen our collective capabilities to respond to natural disasters, with prevention and preparation as the fundamental pillar. Through RescEU we want to help Member States to do more on prevention and to foster a culture of prevention. We also want to help Member States, through European funds, to boost their own national capacities in respect of the various risks they face. Trilogues on these proposals started last week, and we need to conclude these discussions by November this year in order to have RescEU up and running by the summer season, which I think is essential. On what my portfolio covers, as I said at the beginning of the last debate, I was in constant contact with all the authorities – local and regional – and with Members of the European Parliament. We hoped for an assessment of the damage to indicate where we can help, but we are still waiting and it seems that this event is not eligible, according to the legislation agreed and voted by the co—legislators – by the European Parliament and the Council. However, as I said, I am ready to discuss with the Greek authorities the possibility of advance payment and also of changing some operational programmes. We have the envelope for Attica and we can change operational programmes at the request of the Member States if they want to transfer some of the money for reconstruction. We are ready to do whatever is possible to help, according to the legislation we have in place.

Very often, in fact, we have become accustomed to this, we are talking about an ageing European population and increasing numbers of chronic diseases or disabilities. However, we are talking a little less about how much this change will affect the way we work and what impact it will have on the working environment for all of us. I am therefore very happy that, among my colleagues here in Parliament, I have found enough willingness to formulate ways of countering this challenge more actively and together. In preparing the report, I met many experts not only in Brussels, but also in Slovakia. I was interested in the view of the state administration, employers, patient organizations. I thank them for their valuable advice and recommendations. I would also like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs, advisers and secretariat of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment for their excellent cooperation, patience, helpfulness and materiality. Together, we found that approaches to returning to work after illness are often different, and the way in which individual states help their citizens is also different. Nevertheless, there are approaches that we can all support and share together. Unfortunately, there are still many cases where things are not working, people are unaided and states, municipalities or employers are not taking the necessary action. This is a space that we should fill, and I believe that this report can also be helpful. The added value of our work, work from the European Parliament, is to help Member States develop preventive measures in particular, to give careful priority to so-called early intervention when a worker's health deteriorates, thus preventing more complex health problems. Prevention is key. I would also like to mention here that, although chronic diseases, for example, are more likely to be associated with older age, although this is not the case in many cases either, the report also does not forget about mental health, excessive stress and mental problems. They are also part of our lives, and where necessary, we need to talk about them out loud, help eliminate prejudice and improve understanding of mental health. I did not just prepare the report from the table, but I tried to get the view of the people in practice, the people who tried to return to work after illness or disability. These discussions have left me with a great need for better institutional cooperation between all relevant stakeholders, as well as the need for a personalised approach. The occupational rehabilitation of workers consists of three different aspects: the first is medical, the second is occupational and the third is social. Successful rehabilitation and return to work involve all three, and it is important that our report reflects this approach. In the report, we encourage Member States to take an example from good practices and approaches, while at the same time trying to identify areas where the European Union can bring added value and know-how in order to further support policies that will ultimately help Member States to enable workers to be reintegrated into the labour market. It is just as important to me that by successfully practising returning to work after illness, we would be able to give far more people than today the hope of a more dignified and independent life. We are facing two major challenges today. The first one is more technical. We need to improve standards, methods, prevention, cooperation. The other task is about changing perceptions. We need to significantly reclaim the perception of people with health problems or disabilities by the majority society. I believe that this report will be one of the necessary steps towards these objectives.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sk", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 2, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 137, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   – Mr President, colleagues, I would like to thank our colleague Žitňanská for the very comprehensive report she has presented.

The report stresses the need for an individual approach and support for employees, but also, for example, adapting the working environment, removing barriers.

The Commission has put inclusive growth and social fairness at the core of its political agenda, and we are working hard to make sure that no one is left behind. I therefore welcome Ms Žitňanská’s report, and the Commission agrees that we need effective and concrete measures for workers returning to the labour market after injury and illness.  The prerequisite for successful reintegration into the labour market is ensuring the right to a healthy, safe and well-adapted working environment, as clearly recalled in the European Pillar of Social Rights. European Union legislation on occupational safety and health focuses on the legal obligation imposed on employers to assess all occupational risks on a case-by-case basis and to adapt work to the special needs of individuals. We have to bear in mind that Europe is confronted with an ageing working population with increasing work-related health problems, such as muscular-skeletal disorders and mental health conditions, so we need to face and address this reality. The European Union Strategic Framework on Health and Safety for the current programming period already proposes a number of measures to address demographic change and the ageing workforce. Besides, the 2017 Commission communication on ‘Safer and healthier work for all’ has put forward specific preventive and protective measures in accordance with the requirements of sensitive workers. Now, on the reintegration and rehabilitation of workers more specifically, I agree with you that measures allowing early return to work after an accident or disease are needed in order to avoid permanent exclusion. And, you are right, we should see the reintegration process as a new opportunity to benefit from workers’ skills, competence and experience. That is why we have the European Social Fund, on which Member States can already rely to help injured workers, for instance, to get back to work more quickly. For the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) the Commission is going further by proposing to include the health programme as a strand of the European Social Fund plus (ESF+) so health aspects are addressed in all social spending, and vice versa. To conclude, let me assure you that the Commission will continue, in cooperation with the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, which is based in Bilbao, to raise awareness, develop practical guidance and promote the exchange of good practices. Once again, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her work.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we have been working on this report in committee for more than a year, and I am particularly proud of the result we have achieved. Proud because with this text, I believe, we are taking a great step forward in the fight against harassment and bullying of women. Proud because, thanks to this text, we can finally bring to the center of this debate and also of public opinion a problem that for decades has been minimized, for decades has been avoided in the name of an alleged possible diversity of sensitivity, and that instead, thanks to that global movement that has been called \"MeToo\" and that has brought to the center the denunciation of many women , has finally become a central issue. Every day women and girls are subjected to violence, harassed, harassed in the workplace, in the bar, in the cinema, in the park, in the gym, and this long list of places could really go on forever, unfortunately. And to these places we must add, unfortunately, another new public place, which is the virtual public place, it is social networks, it is chats, it is websites, it is blogs, they are those virtual places where, unfortunately, verbal and psychological violence materializes dramatically more and more. At that time, in the FEMM Committee, we wanted to draw attention to these events, to these new events that are taking place, to emphasize this aspect that is increasingly appearing in our daily chronicles. Because all kinds of violence, all kinds of harassment have very serious consequences, it has psychological or physical consequences, as demonstrated precisely by the cases of suicide of girls who have very often been victims of revenge porn or digital bullying online, and who have not been able to cope with the burden of shame of what they had suffered. It is for them, for all the women who have been harassed, for all the women who are harassed, that we are carrying on this battle. And we call on the Commission to make a greater effort, Commissioner, as the European executive. We want a directive to finally be proposed which will standardise the fight against gender-based violence, and we want this directive to have a clear, uniform definition of what it means to be harassed or harassed. Above all, we want a clear definition of what a public place means today because, as we said before, technologies have changed this concept by creating new virtual squares, where verbal violence no longer has control, mainly because people feel practically invincible and unpunishable in these virtual environments, where one can easily hide behind a nickname to feel untouchable. So we also ask for more education, we also ask for more attention on this aspect, because it is precisely from school, which is the first public place where children begin to confront reality, with their schoolmates, that we must begin, educating gender equality, educating equality, respect and awareness, because respect is due to everyone and because the sex of the person cannot do it better or worse than another.

Unfortunately sexual harassment and mobbing are an unacceptable, yet widespread, form of behaviour in our European society. As has been said, we know this happens everywhere: at work, in schools and universities, on the street, in public transport, online, at festivals and at sport and other events. The world woke up last year with the ‘Me Too’ movement and it was literally a wake—up call. People finally saw the huge extent of sexism, harassment, abuse and violence that women and girls are facing every day in society. Around half of the women in the European Union experience verbal, physical or online sexual harassment. In the case of women in higher management or professional occupations, such as lawyers and doctors, the proportion balloons to 75%. We have to change the perception in our societies that harassing a woman is normal, acceptable behaviour. We all have this responsibility, whether we are politicians, police officers, teachers, employees or operators of internet platforms. Women should not feel that it is unsafe for them to travel, to go to work, to be out in the street or to be active online. How many of you are ready to go on foot to your hotels tonight when we finish at 11 o’clock? I do not feel safe doing so even though it would be healthy. Having said this, it is worth reminding you that our efforts to end violence and harassment against women have not just started recently. More than 20 years ago, Parliament was instrumental when we set up the Daphne Programme. Besides, we have been working for decades in the European Union to develop legislation, policy and concrete grassroots actions to prevent violence and to support victims. We have to continue on this path, which includes the European Union’s signing of the Istanbul Convention last year and the current process of conclusion. Having been a Member of the European Parliament for eight years, and now a Commissioner for three years, I can tell you that this journey is slow and long. We in the Commission are working closely with the Council towards EU accession to the Convention, but we really call on those Member States which have not yet ratified it to proceed to do so without further delay. To conclude, I would like to mention that the Commission has had an anti—harassment policy in place since 2006. It combines prevention and information to all staff, as well as training, with reactive measures to deal with the situation of workplace conflict and harassment. I want to reiterate that the Commission is fully committed to the fight against all forms of gender—based violence, including sexual harassment. Let me be very clear: even a single case of harassment will always be one case too many. Thank you for your attention and for your hard work.

At the outset, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs who worked on this own-initiative report with me over the course of the last number of months, and also to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, who voted for this report in such large numbers just before the summer. I think we have arrived at a good settlement on what is not only a crucially important issue for the European Union and its relationship with third countries but also a crucially important issue for financial stability within the European Union and in the relationships we have with others. I also want to recognise that this is a forward-looking report, trying to map out, and to achieve a considered view by Parliament about, the future equivalence arrangements that should exist in terms of our relationship with third countries. I welcome the fact that the Commission in 2017 put forward a review of the equivalence framework. It is right and proper that we should look at our procedures in place, and equally it is right and proper that Parliament should have some role in terms of shaping that review and making sure that we have a meaningful input into its final outworkings. We in the European Union have worked hard at reducing risk, especially since the crisis: reducing market fragmentation, and also ensuring that we have an international standard in terms of our financial regulation here within the European Union. We have international responsibility for ensuring that the international order, in terms of rule-making and rule-taking, is adopted not just within the European Union, at an inter-institutional level, but also by all Member States of the Union. So having a rules-based system sends a strong message to those members of the international community that have a third-country relationship with us about what we expect in that. It is also fair to say that, in trying to reach that international best standard, Europe is doing its bit to reduce any of the systemic risks and threats that have been built up over past decades. There is a clear advantage in Europe being a standard bearer for good financial regulation globally and that is something we always need to keep in mind when talking about this issue. We also need to recognise that the existing equivalence regime is really a technical regime in which the Commission has extraordinary power, and we need to recognise that, in many cases, the Commission gets those decisions right on case-by-case deliberation of the issues that come before it, and on a file-by-file basis. But that’s not to say that the framework cannot be improved – it would be a ridiculous position if there were no possibility of the regime for equivalence being improved. What we have tried to set out in this report are areas where we can improve the system in the future: areas of greater transparency in the Commission’s dealings with Parliament; how Parliament can assess and analyse some of these decisions; and a monitoring role for Parliament, making sure that decisions are taken by way of delegated acts, making sure that Parliament is fully aware of the circumstances and the position contained in decisions. I haven’t mentioned Brexit because this report is not about Brexit, despite the fact that, when we first embarked on the own-initiative report, people were obsessed by Brexit. This is about setting our house in order, making sure that we have a system in place for the future, and making sure that system is transparent for all, and applies the best possible international standards in our dealings with third countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 163, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Jonás FERNÁNDEZ", "mepid": "125046", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner. Europe has been making a special effort to have a stable and secure financial sector for a few years now. The crisis reminded us that banks and financial institutions were poorly regulated and poorly supervised. Europe has been working for years to have a robust financial system that can provide services to consumers and is also particularly stable. And, therefore, it is very important that financial institutions providing services to the European market comply with equivalent regulations, with controls that can be approved for European regulation.  And for this there are equivalence systems.  Equivalence systems that the Commission manages but which need to be more transparent; there has to be stricter control on the part of the European Parliament and the model has to be revised because in the coming months we will have to negotiate a future agreement with the UK, which also makes it particularly important.

I welcome the large consensus among political groups. Indeed, it is in our interests to have robust international cooperation, matching cross—border business activity in this area. Of course, it increases competition, consumer and investor protection and accelerates innovation in the sector and it helps public authorities ensure financial viability in the European Union. You know very well, honourable Members, that the European Union financial system is a very open to financial service providers from many parts of the world. The European Union has adopted more than two hundred positive decisions in financial services, covering more than thirty non—EU jurisdictions. You know that that the equivalence process requires that we look at each third country in a regulatory and supervisory framework separately, sector by sector, and we do this in a proportionate and risk—sensitive manner. In this respect I welcome that the report confirms that the equivalence is the most suitable and flexible tool for relations with third countries in financial services. Of course, it is not perfect, but compared to other alternatives, equivalence preserves the autonomy of EU decision—making and provides powerful incentives for regulatory and supervisory cooperation at international level.  The Commission agrees with the report in the same areas. The European Union framework for third—country equivalence should be further enhanced. In this regard, a number of important proposals were adopted last year. For example, the proposal to amend the European market infrastructure regulation differentiates between the treatment of systematically important third—country centre counterparties and the treatment of non—systematically important ones. The proposal also shows in which circumstances we would need to go beyond equivalence as a last resort. Finally, we propose to clarify the role of the European Supervisory Authorities in preparing equivalence decisions. We also propose that these authorities assume greater responsibility for monitoring the situation in third countries on with the Commission has taken an equivalence decision.  Now regarding transparency, the Commission agrees that the transparency of the process for granting equivalence can be improved. Over the past three years, we have sought to raise transparency and awareness. For example, in February 2017, we published a staff document to explain our approach. The Commission is ready to come to the Parliament and keep its Members closely informed. Besides, in some of our latest proposals we have put forward the possibility for Parliament and the Council to play a more prominent role in equivalence policy by scrutinising delegating acts which set out detailed equivalence criteria to be applied to the Commission. Lastly, the Commission agrees that equivalence will play an important role in shaping the European Union’s regulatory and economic relations with the UK once it has become a third country. Let me conclude by welcoming once again, the work of all of you and the work of the European Parliament. The Commission now, of course, counts on Parliament and the Council, as co—legislators, to continue moving as swiftly as possible in the coming months to adopt the on-going proposal. Thank you very much for your attention and for your work.

Equivalence also serves as an instrument to ensure fair and equal regulation and supervision between EU financial institutions and third-country financial institutions. Equivalence also works on a reciprocal basis: other jurisdictions give EU market participants access to their financial markets. This gives European companies the assurance that European rules and conditions apply in the third countries where they develop their economic activity and provide their financial goods and services. Since the financial crisis, more than 40 new EU financial rules have been adopted. Of these 40 new acts, 15 contain third country clauses that allow the Commission, on behalf of the EU, to unilaterally decide whether the rules in foreign jurisdictions can be considered equivalent.

It reflects the centrality of the language to people’s identity and culture. In the same way, Europe’s linguistic diversity is an integral element of European identity, reflected in the motto Unity in diversity. The EU has 500 million citizens, 24 official languages, five co-official languages and three alphabets, but some 60 other languages are also part of the EU’s heritage, including sign languages, which are included in my report.  The EU has played an important role in supporting linguistic diversity and encouraging the promotion and protection of minority and lesser—spoken languages. This is in Article 22 of the Charter for Fundamental Rights. The Committee on Culture and Education agreed that we must ensure comprehensive EU—level legal protection for regional and minority languages, recognising the collective rights of national and linguistic minorities in the digital world. Because when we go online, we find a world where many languages are at risk of extinction. New technologies like Siri and Alexa are changing the way we live our lives, but are available in just a few languages. As this technology gets more widely used, the speakers of other languages are being left behind. To help address this problem my report calls on the Commission to bring forward a range of measures, including: allocating the specific area of multilingualism and language technology to the portfolio of one Commissioner; establishing a large—scale, long—term funding programme for research and development and innovation, as well as establishing a European language technology platform, and extending the digital language diversity project; supporting education policies to ensure that the next generation of Europeans will lead the way in this field, as well as encouraging companies to take the business opportunities that this would present. Our multilingualism is a great asset, an opportunity, and at the same time is one of the EU’s greatest challenges. The impetus from my report was a STOA study entitled ‘Language equality in the digital age – Towards a human language project’ which showed the social and economic consequences of language barriers. In fact, we see the technology gap widening between the large, well—resourced languages and others, even some official languages.  The network of experts on language technologies –META—NET– warns that at least 21 European languages are in danger of extinction in the digital world. So we must act, and urgently. This is a huge opportunity for the EU to demonstrate a real commitment to language equality which will benefit all its citizens, to share ideas and good practice, and I am proud that researchers in Wales, such as in Canolfan Bedwyr at Bangor University, are leading the way.  Finally, can I thank the shadow rapporteurs for their enthusiastic cooperation, my assistant, Cai Elis, for his excellent work on this report, as well as our Group staff, colleagues in the Committee on Industry, Trade and Research, the committee secretariat and all the experts who advised me during the process.

The report comes at a time when digital technologies are transforming our society and economy at an unprecedented pace, offering opportunities but also revealing barriers to multilingualism and language equality in the digital age. In highlighting the complexity brought about by language diversity and the fundamental importance of language technologies on the road to achieving language equality, the report provides food for thought for developing future actions. Language technologies are an essential component of any digital device or service we use nowadays. Continuous research, innovation and deployment in the area of language technologies can therefore bring us closer and closer towards multilingualism at an acceptable cost. Ensuring appropriate technological support for all European languages will also create jobs, growth and opportunities in the digital single market. It will enhance the quality of public services, and reinforce a stronger sense of unity and belonging throughout Europe. EU funding has already led to a number of results. For example, in the Moses machine translations system, an open research result that has been taken up by the Commission for its in—house system or the modern machine translation project which developed a neural system that automatically improves translations. To leverage the achievements, under the next Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), we will need to reinforce funding, research and education actions. The Commission has therefore submitted programme proposals for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, seeking funding to continue its work towards technology enabled language equality. Overall, I would like to remind you that the Commission is committed to working towards an inclusive union offering seamless access to digital services, products and content, irrespective of language or location. Union citizens, businesses and public administrations can enjoy the right to access such services, products and content without discrimination based on language. I think it is also very important to say that we are focusing on the exchange of good practice in the policy recommendation, as well as funding programmes such as Erasmus+ and Creative Europe. The Commission has also confirmed the actions of the Council of Europe’s European Centre for Modern Languages, aimed, among other things, at supporting teachers working with children from different linguistic backgrounds. Finally, the Commission raised awareness of the importance of language learning through public events like the European Day of Languages on 26 September and the national awards of the European Language Label for innovative language learning projects. To conclude, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Evans, once again for her valuable work.

We have increasing scientific evidence that forest cover is the one feasible option we have for combating climate change. Connected with that, we have to care for the soil, with its rich microbial life, which is the basis for life systems. However, we know that deforestation is currently the number two cause of greenhouse gas emissions. I believe that the EU has done a lot to try to protect forests worldwide, but it can do better. Namely, the EU already has excellent tools, which can be used to assist our partner countries on the way to better development. We have, for instance, the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade instrument, which we call the Flegt Action Plan, and we have linked this with the Voluntary Partnership Agreements, which have proven to be indispensable tools in improving forest governance in partner countries. These Voluntary Partnership Agreements have brought stakeholders – I am talking about civil society, local and indigenous peoples, law-enforcement agents and governments – broadly together to the same negotiating table, to try to solve the difficult issue of deforestation so we can invest more in this important instrument in order to tackle corruption, which is often the cause of deforestation. We can also address the issue of so-called conflict timber just as we have addressed conflict minerals. I want to stress that there is a need for sufficient resources for these mechanisms and that Parliament should do more to secure those resources. What is urgently needed, however, is a coherent, all-encompassing EU action plan to stop deforestation and forest degradation. This is already several years overdue and I hope very much that the Commission will now take inspiration from this own-initiative report and will urgently open a genuine stakeholder consultation, which in turn will pave the way for the action plan against deforestation and forest degradation. I hope that Commissioner Mimica will continue to support these measures, which are outlined in the report. There are some striking examples of the fact that voluntary approaches to tackling deforestation in EU policy are not enough. For instance, in the cocoa sector, the EU is responsible for over 60% of global imports of cocoa, and the major part of the global cocoa supply is produced in Côte d’Ivoire and Ghana. However – you may not believe this, but it is true – in Côte d’Ivoire, for instance, 40% of production takes place on illegally converted forest land. I am sure that we, as European consumers, do not want to see this continue. I’m very glad, too, to hear private-sector voices being raised to call for mandatory due diligence in the cocoa supply chains, and, with this report, I hope we can address these requirements at EU level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 179, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Julie WARD", "mepid": "124963", "text": "   – Mr President, we need to hold our governments and our businesses accountable for the way they engage with other countries, especially when it comes to preserving natural resources.

First, to have a regulatory framework for enforcing transparency obligations throughout the supply of risky forest products; second, to strengthen the sustainable development chapter with sanction mechanisms.

The Commission welcomes the report and warmly thanks the rapporteur, Vice-President Heidi Hautala, for the excellent work undertaken. Forests are nature’s most generous renewable resources. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the new European Consensus on Development have reaffirmed the urgency to tackle illegal and unsustainable exploitation of forests by supporting better governance. In this endeavour, transparency and accountability – two elements highlighted by this report –show a way forward. As far as the Commission is concerned, we are strongly committed to tackling illegal logging and trade, and promoting good governance in the forestry sector. Through the EU flagship initiative the Forest Law-enforcement, Governance and Trade Action Plan, we have put forward a comprehensive toolkit to tackle both the illegal production of timber and its consumption. This year marks the first 15 years, so let me briefly recall the significant achievements of the forest action plan. A key element is the new Timber Regulation. I am pleased to confirm that after more than five years of implementation, there is steady progress in its enforcement. In 2009, the EU concluded its first voluntary partnership agreement with Ghana. As of today, we count 15 agreements, and we recently initiated an agreement with Honduras, and we hope to close this year with Guyana and Vietnam. Voluntary partnership agreements have been the cornerstone of the forest action plan. An important proof of this is Indonesia which in November 2016 became the first country to export timber to the EU that was licensed through the action plan. Since then, Indonesia has issued close to 40 000 licenses with a total value of more than USD 1 billion. That is about 25% of tropical timber imports into the European Union. Forest law-enforcement, governance and trade and licensing are a significant milestone yet it is only the end of a long journey that involves overall governance improvement, as we see in Ghana. And, most importantly the benefits go beyond forests, contributing to larger EU initiatives such as the protection of indigenous people’s rights and environmental defenders. The Forest Law-Enforcement, Governance and Trade initiative owes part of its success to the engagement of the private sector as you have already said. New alliances are necessary, including with big consumer countries, especially China, and with financial institutions. The Commission is currently concluding the Forest Law-Enforcement, Governance and Trade work plan for the period 2018-2022, and the European Union has also included environmental crime linked to forests in the priorities of its overall fight against organised crime for 2018-2021. In the end, I would like to say that the Commission hears your call for more measures to halt deforestations. The EU is already doing a lot through the forest flagship initiative I just mentioned, through the mechanism of the reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation. We will draw the lessons but more needs to be done. Deforestation is a complex matter requiring a specific approach that involves all the relevant stakeholders, not least in partner countries. We therefore intend to pursue a high level of ambition in the next Multiannual Financial Framework, including through our broad neighbourhood development and international cooperation instruments. It will seek to mainstream environmental protection in a geographical pillar and complement this by targeted thematic actions on sustainable forest management, illegal logging and conflict timber. We look forward to your support.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 184, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  I close the debate.

The fact that there was twice as many forests in Estonia 100 years ago shows that our organisation and ethics of forest management have not been sustainable. That's just the last decade. For hundreds of years, estonians worked to make the swamp fields and the scrubbed woodland - today our forest becomes one of the most vast cuttings in the conduct of state institutions.  We should put an end to the hypocritical practice of producing renewable energy by burning wood in cauldrons and, more importantly, to marketing it as an environmentally friendly energy source to other countries that had a lower share of renewable energy than expected. Not to mention its environmental impact, the burning of high-quality wood into ash also has its own economic damage factor: this wood could be used more sustainably in another sector, but also at a higher profit.

Unfortunately, they still face numerous specific problems that make them perform worse than regions within countries. Their economic potential is not fully exploited. I am pleased that the European Commission has recognised this problem and has carried out an examination of these legal and administrative barriers and a public consultation resulting in a communication on increasing economic growth and cohesion in the border regions of the European Union, identifying ten main obstacles and proposing solutions to these problems. However, I would like to stress that I consider it particularly important to carry out a similar review for the regions at the external borders. Indeed, we must bear in mind that the solutions proposed in the review currently under discussion cannot, in many cases, be easily transferred to these regions. This is due to their very different specificities, such as the absence of the Schengen area, the non-share of the common market and many others. I would therefore like to ask the Commission to prepare a separate analysis for both the external regions and the maritime regions. I am convinced that mutual trust and political will of all competent authorities, including local and regional authorities in particular, is the most powerful tool for overcoming the burden on the development of border regions. This requires both flexibility and sometimes specific rules to ensure consistency between different legal systems, as often even the same directive is transposed differently in two neighbouring countries. It should therefore be emphasised that a number of urgent issues require more targeted intensive action at both Member State and European Union level to enable local authorities to cooperate more effectively. Cross-border workers must have recognised qualifications and should be well informed of their social security. Barriers to cross-border entrepreneurs should also be removed, as cross-border businesses currently have sixty per cent higher costs than companies operating in one country. I would like to draw attention to the huge positive role played by the European Territorial Cooperation programmes in overcoming barriers. I would like to express my full support for their continuation, or indeed their strengthening after 2021. Interreg is a program that, thanks to a bottom-up approach, has proven its effectiveness in establishing cooperation, among others, in the fields of health, education, environmental protection, and has also contributed to building trust between local communities on both sides of the border. While appreciating the role of the Cross-Border Cooperation Programme, I would also like to draw attention to the potential of European territorial cooperation groups. I am convinced that, thanks to this instrument, we are able to overcome many of the problems that border regions currently face.  I also believe that we should boldly deepen cross-border cooperation, which is why I consider it necessary and justified to strengthen new tools for managing cross-border cooperation. Finally, I would like to stress that I am pleased that the Commission has set up a coordination point for cross-border cases. I believe that it will be an effective tool for national and regional authorities to deal with legal or administrative obstacles at the borders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 189, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Daniel BUDA", "mepid": "125012", "text": "   – Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, cross-border regions are an essential part of European territory, and a third of European citizens live in these regions.

Firstly, the mobility of workers across borders is an important factor in the development of cooperation, and Member States, through regional authorities, are obliged to facilitate the free movement of workers in these regions. Lack of connectivity is another aspect that prevents the isation of cross-border activities, and the authorities in these regions are responsible for contributing solutions to complement the missing links in transport networks. Regional authorities should do more to encourage entrepreneurship in cross-border regions by creating common electronic portals for economic activities on both sides of borders.

I think it depends, of course, very much on the Member States, but it would not hurt to come up with experience from the Commission, with a procedure, with an example, and to try to increase the funds that are allocated for cross-border economic development, because – it has been said here – a good part of the citizens of the European Union live in these areas.

Este un subiect care îmi este foarte aproape de suflet. S-au spus foarte multe aici, dar, dincolo de avantajele cooperării transfrontaliere în ceea ce privește crearea de locuri de muncă, creșterea economică, având în vedere posibilitățile de dezvoltare, eu văd și un alt rol al cooperării transfrontaliere mai important decât orice, acela de a vindeca rănile pe care încă le avem pe harta Uniunii Europene, pe harta continentului nostru. Am început dezbaterea din această seară cu raportul privind beneficiile politicii de coeziune în Irlanda de Nord, un caz foarte clar în care vedem cât de greu se construiește pacea și cât de ușor se poate pierde. În cei aproape 4 ani de când sunt comisar european pentru politică regională am vizitat foarte multe proiecte transfrontaliere și am fost foarte emoționată, de pildă, când am vizitat proiecte dintre Polonia și Germania, între Šlovice și Frankfurt(Oder), de asemenea între Bratislava și Austria de jos și alte proiecte în jurul granițelor, unde acum aproape 30 de ani au murit atâtea mii de oameni în căutarea unei vieți mai bune. De aceea, facem tot ce putem și am făcut tot ce am putut în această perioadă pentru a îmbunătăți această cooperare transfrontalieră, care uneori merge foarte ușor, în ciuda diferențelor de limbă, alteori, cum este cazul între Belgia și Franța de pildă, deși e aceeași limbă, din cauza faptului că cele două țări nu se înțeleg să adopte o legislație comună în cooperarea transfrontalieră, aceasta este mai greoaie. De asemenea, sunt întristată să văd câte proiecte transfrontaliere sunt blocate din cauza orgoliilor unor state. În fond și la urma urmei, acest program Interreg și de cooperare transfrontalieră a fost creat pentru a îmbunătăți comunicarea dintre oameni. Suntem în septembrie 2018 și foarte multe dintre proiectele de cooperare transfrontalieră dintre statele membre sunt blocate, banii sunt necheltuiți pentru că statele membre nu se înțeleg în privința proiectelor asupra cărora să cheltuiască acești bani. I will continue in English. Thank you very much for this enriching debate. I would also like to thank the rapporteur for this report and for what I see as a very positive approach towards the Commission’s initiative in favour of European border regions. I of course share this assessment of the situation faced by border regions and the call for continued attention to be paid to them.  As I said, this is what the Commission is doing. Since the adoption of the communication on border regions in September last year, a number of concrete measures have already been initiated. I have in mind, in particular, the border focal point that was established in January 2018 and is now operational. It coordinates action between the Commission services responsible, but also has a mission to liaise and interact with external stakeholders. This hands—on approach has been reinforced with the launch of online exchange platforms for border stakeholders and institutions, and we have also recently selected ten pilot projects to identify ways in which certain legal and administrative obstacles can be resolved. Besides, we have been carrying out targeted work on specific cross—border issues, be it a recent study on missing rail links, a merging of cross—border healthcare or a regional border workshop for businesses and citizens.  All this work mirrors the Commission’s commitment to ensuring that no region is left behind. It also underpins our proposal for the next programming period. As you know, a new legal instrument to resolve border obstacles was proposed by the Commission on 29 May 2018 and is currently being considered by Member States and in Parliament in the relevant committees. The draft proposals for the Interreg Programmes post—2020 also contain elements that will facilitate the prevention and lifting of border obstacles. Notably, it is proposed that each cross—border cooperation programme dedicates at least 15% of its budget to institutional cooperation, including the resolution of legal and administrative issues. Member States will, of course, continue to have a strong role to play in this process. The Commission will support them in their endeavour to improve the socio—economic development of their border regions by making good practices widely available and by ensuring that future cross—border cooperation programmes are tailored to the specific needs of border regions. To conclude, allow me to make a specific call both to the Council and to you, the European Parliament. I know you were working very hard on our budgetary proposal over the summer, but it is crucial to progress as speedily as possible. Indeed, the future generation of cross—border programmes and the new legal instrument to resolve border obstacles are crucial to further growth and cohesion in our internal border region.  Thank you very much for having this important subject on our agenda. Hopefully we will have the Multiannual Financial Framework as soon as possible in order to be able to start the implementation of the programmes from the first day of the new programming period, from 1 January 2021. We should draw from the lesson that we have now of all the operational programmes in the project being so delayed due to the late adoption of the legislation for the programming period 2014—2020.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 193, "date": "2018-09-10.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "  Thank you, Commissioner, for those hours spent with us.

On the other hand, the concern for migration is, but it is especially concerned with the absence of a European response. Firstly, to change the European Union's negative view of the migration phenomenon, thinking distically that zero migration can be achieved, by denying the phenomenon or by closing the floodgates.  But secondly, we must change the non-European view, which refuses to share responsibility.
