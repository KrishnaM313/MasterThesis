Madam President, who is familiar with this subject, Commissioner Reynders, ladies and gentlemen, while I am happy to start this debate with you this morning, I am particularly pleased to have managed to fight a noble battle for better consumer protection over the past two and a half years. Why did this directive come about? Scandals as resounding as dieselgate or the justified cancellation of flights by Ryanair had convinced the European Commission, we remember, to legislate, thus presenting a draft directive. It was April 11, 2018. Two and a half years later, after numerous meetings and negotiations and many compromises and, let us say, twists and turns, we are all now able to offer a new concrete right to European citizens: that of allowing them to join forces to seek redress if they suffered harm as a result of the illegal practice of a multinational. Until now, we knew that, in the face of airlines, large banks or large industrial companies, a single consumer was not acting in court, because justice is a long, costly and uncertain process. Until now, too, these class actions were only possible in some European countries: nearly a dozen States did not have them and, above all, it was impossible to bring an action in a country other than his own and thus to associate with other European consumers. With this European-wide class action, it is therefore a change of ambition and a change of dimension that we are proposing to all the citizens of the European Union. This result is the result of long struggles for each political group to agree to leave its ideological comfort zone. Everyone understood that we all had to gain from finding a balanced solution that is both more protective of consumers and, I stress, sufficiently secure for the lives of businesses that need it. Nothing was won in advance, for many of the received ideas were conveyed and dictated by seemingly contradictory and often traditional interests that had to be accepted to be shaken up in the face of the new demands. I would like here this morning to thank every political group, without exception, for finding the path of unity to reach a solution of which Parliament, I say, can be proud. It is this right balance that we have also been able to impose at the trilogue meetings and which finally gives full force to this reform. Everyone wins, the consumer comes first. The full compensation will go back to him, contrary to the excesses of the American system, which we did not want. Whether it is the user of a washing machine, a financial product, a website or an airline, every aggrieved European consumer will be able, through these class actions, to be better defended, better compensated and, ultimately, better protected. Companies also win: they will be protected from abusive or slanderous delaying remedies by a significant number of conditions that we have demanded that will ensure the transparency of financing and the absence of conflicts of interest of qualified entities. Hedge funds and law firms will not be able, for example, to sue themselves and be a party to the lawsuit, as the action is reserved for licensed and recognized consumer associations. Europe, finally, is winning at a time when people are, sometimes rightly, blaming the European Union for imposing a number of standards and constraints. It demonstrates here that it knows how to adapt to new needs and above all that it is able to offer new rights to citizens. This is economic progress, legal progress, but above all a political progress that we must all take ownership of and that we can all claim. I would like to thank the European Commission: in particular, of course, Commissioner Reynders, but also all his teams who have worked hard. I would like to thank the Council and in particular the Croatian Presidency, with which we have concluded negotiations, my colleagues in Parliament, the shadow rapporteurs, including you, Heidi Hautala, the teams of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the various political groups, whether at the Level of Members or at the level of collaborators, for their intense and constant cooperation on this issue.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, let me thank you for the opportunity this morning to exchange with you on the Directive on Representative Actions. Above all, I would like to thank Mr Geoffroy Didier and the shadow rapporteurs of the Committee on Legal Affairs, but also all the players involved in the European Parliament, including the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, for their work during the inter-institutional negotiations, especially since the work took place during the Croatian Presidency under difficult conditions in view of the confinement. The Representative Actions Directive is an operational response by the European Union to violations of consumer rights. The latter are often deprived in the face of certain professionals who resort to illegal business practices. We all have Dieselgate in mind, to name just one example. The situation created by the COVID-19 pandemic has further highlighted the challenges faced by consumers who wish to assert their rights. I am thinking here of massive cancellations of flights and package trips without respecting the right to refund: we talked about this again last night during our debates on the consumer agenda and on Mr David Cormand's report. The adoption of this directive is therefore more necessary than ever. It will enable all European consumers to finally have this powerful tool for the protection of their rights, which is the class action.  The text on which the co-legislators agreed is balanced, whether it is the operation of the system, the control of the financing of representative actions in order to avoid conflicts of interest, support for qualified entities to ensure the effectiveness of the procedure or the various guarantees related to the cost of representative action in reparation. The scope of the text is broad enough to cover violations of consumer rights in a wide range of areas, well beyond the traditional scope of consumer protection. These include energy, telecommunications, data protection, financial services or medical devices. The procedural modalities provided are able to ensure the effectiveness of the mechanism, while respecting the procedural autonomy of the Member States. In addition, the directive provides important safeguards for professionals at all levels of the procedure. Thus, the text ensures that their right to defend is respected and the risk of abusive litigation avoided. I would like to thank the European Parliament once again for its strong commitment to consumers throughout this process.

Madame la Présidente, Monsieur le Commissaire, chers coll gues, tout d'abord, vous l'avez mentionné, Monsieur le Commissaire, notre coll gue Geoffroy Didier a fait un excellent travail et je m'en félicite. C'est vraiment respectable. Mais, chers coll gues, le résultat ne correspond pas du tout ce dont nous avons discuté here. Tant donné qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une harmonisation maximum, cet outil va apporter 27 solutions différentes et je ne peux pas m'en féliciter, Monsieur le Commissaire.

Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is I would like to do that. Of course, there is a political drive to more class action, to more collective law enforcement. The European Parliament has not been able to oppose this in the long term. However, we have not achieved the objectives that we formulated at the beginning– including on the part of the Commission – that we create a single European model to which all the courts of the Member States, to which all the legal systems of the Member States belong in a uniform manner, have not been achieved. And in that respect, Commissioner, all the fine words are too much. It will not be possible for you, even with the best of intentions and the greatest commitment, to persuade 27 Member State governments to find a single solution. It will simply not be possible, and it will of course lead to smaller Member States such as Malta or Cyprus creating incentives for American law firms to establish themselves there, of course, through favourable tax tricks, so that appropriate law firms can establish themselves there. It will lead to different procedural issues being dealt with differently in the Member States, and it will lead precisely to the confusion in Europe that we have always wanted to avoid and which already exists in the United States today – all at the expense that ultimately the consumers, not the businesses, will have to bear.

When hundreds of thousands of consumers were defrauded by Volkswagen in the Dieselgate scandal, US and Australian citizens could seek compensation together, but this was not the case for EU citizens. Earlier this year, the European Court of Justice ruled that a German woman couldn’t claim compensation over faulty breast implants because the company that made them was only liable in France. And today marks an end to all that. Our new rules mean that you can join with other people from your own country and from across Europe to fight for collective compensation. Consumers that have suffered harm will no longer have to wait years because different legal actions are ongoing, but instead benefit from one single procedure. That’s a major step forward. I’m also pleased that scarce resources won’t prevent justice for consumers. We are encouraging public funding for consumer organisations and calling for the cost of access to justice to be reduced. In spite of fierce lobbying and resistance from national and industry interests, if your rights as a passenger on a train or plane are violated, for instance in the case of delays or poor service, you can start a collective lawsuit too.  So today we are taking a crucial step, but of course there is more work to do. In the long run, I think that collective redress should be available to all victims of harm at the hands of EU companies, whether or not those victims are EU citizens. I think that, in the future, collective redress should also be available to citizens, regardless of whether they are consumers or not, because why can someone who owns a Volkswagen seek compensation, but not someone who owns a bike and is forced to inhale diesel fumes at every traffic light? And I’m speaking from experience here. But those are all questions for the future. For now, I want to warmly thank the rapporteur and our negotiation team for good cooperation and for our excellent result. This new law will enhance consumer protection, improve access to justice and hold companies to account where needed.

We've all been aggrieved consumers, but what do you do if the producer or seller doesn't meet you? Then how do you get it right?  Going to court on your own doesn't just get a lot of hassle. It also takes time and you often have less left over than the original damage. But most of the time, you're not alone. And that matters, because research shows that almost 80% of consumers would be more likely to go to court if they could do it together with other consumers in the same position. That is why the new directive is good news for representative actions. Whether it is misuse of your personal data, negligent financial services or unsafe products, it will soon be possible in every Member State for consumers to be represented by the Consumer Association or another organisation and to jointly make a claim to a company that has caused them damage.  After 30 years of discussion, this is not only important profit for consumers, but also for businesses. While most European companies, of course, adhere to European consumer rules, these new rules are also a good stick behind the door for companies that do not take it so closely. So it improves the level playing field in Europe. In addition, abuse of these cases is countered by the fact that we have formulated a number of requirements that parties wishing to start a case must comply with.  The directive is therefore a win-win that directly contributes to the position of consumers and companies.

When consumers are harmed by a large company, they often feel helpless to claim their rights. This directive aims to help them obtain justice by providing them with a European collective action mechanism. The directive calls on each Member State to designate qualified not-for-profit entities that will be responsible for bringing legal actions before national courts on behalf of aggrieved consumers. These qualified entities will therefore have the merit of breaking the loneliness of consumers by grouping them into collective actions, thus turning their initial weakness into strength. The directive is flexible because it allows each state to choose both associations and public bodies. In addition, it respects national systems of collective action when they already exist, as has been the case in France since the law of 17 March 2014. When successful, the class action will require the condemned company to offer aggrieved consumers the type of compensation best suited to their case: compensation, repair, replacement, price reduction, contract resolution or reimbursement of the price paid.

Madam President, a company that spies on everything: its workers, its trade union representatives, its detractors, the slightest gestures, the people frequented, the messages exchanged on social networks and the most intimate private life. This is not taken from George Orwell's 1984 novel; it happens every day today within Amazon. We already knew that Amazon was destroying the environment, attacking social rights and practicing tax evasion. We now know, from a vast investigation published by the American newspaper VICE, that Amazon directly uses a spy company to monitor all those who question its omnipotence, from trade unionists to Greenpeace and Greta Thunberg, to yellow vests in France. Everything is systematically recorded, assessed and categorized according to five levels of risk, from moderate to critical. The mere fact that two CGT trade unionists distributed leaflets in front of a warehouse on 10 March 2020 was reported. With one goal: to intimidate, deter, to suppress any dissent of the empire. An Amazon empire whose profits have tripled since the beginning of the year to benefit its boss, Jeff Bezos, who swims in an ocean of wealth unmatched by nearly $200 billion. So to recognize today, through class actions, the right of consumers to join forces to obtain redress is a first victory, which we welcome. However, the European Union is not just a market and citizens are not just consumers. The example of Amazon demonstrates the urgent need to expand citizens' shields beyond the scope of consumption to establish a real duty of corporate vigilance and protect fundamental rights, workers' rights and the environment. Indeed, society as a whole could file a complaint against Amazon: the workers they operate, the associations they spy on, the small business they destroy and the public services they dry up by practicing tax evasion.

Five years ago, a historic environmental and consumer scandal went into the public eye. Volkswagen had installed multi-million-million worth of cheating software in their cars, so it looked as if the cars were more environmentally friendly than they were. When I mention this matter now, it is because in many ways it serves as a backdrop to the legislation we are now about to adopt. The dieselgate scandal was a scandal in itself, but it also made it clear that we had a gap in the EU legal system. Consumers were not able to bring a joint class action in Germany, but instead had to do so nationally in their own countries. Of course, that should not be the case.  The internal market must not only benefit businesses, it must also benefit consumers. There is a need to ensure effective legal protection when companies cheat. That is why I am also pleased that an agreement on collective action for European consumers has been successfully reached. The more consumers who unite behind an indictment, the stronger they will be in the trial.  Not everything is perfect in this agreement, but I nevertheless think it is important to be happy with it, and I would like to highlight two things. One is that it is good that we have finally succeeded in introducing a principle that the loser pays. Large class actions are often very expensive and therefore it is only reasonable that it is the losing party who pays. Secondly, I am very pleased that we have a European Consumer Ombudsman. Such a body would ensure independence in the supervision of consumers' rights.  I do not necessarily believe that this can prevent a new Dieselgate scandal, but it does provide consumers with better opportunities to collectively defend their rights if they were to be let down again by companies.

The system comes from the Anglican case law, as we know.  Therefore, in Europe, where Roman law has been received – at least in continental Europe – nothing like it is enshrined in a legal order. As a lawyer, one is, of course, particularly sceptical about this matter. Of course, we do not know whether this can also result in meaningful interlocking at the end of the day and at the end of this implementation. However, in the case of collective actions, I can say for myself that I think it makes perfect sense to enshrine them, because it primarily serves the consumer.  We usually have a very counterweight situation here. On the one hand, we have consumers, whose market power is rather low, and on the other hand, large companies, which have great market power, naturally also have enough capital to fight any legal disputes.

It is good news that we are discussing today the completion of the Directive on representative actions and the possibility for consumers in all Member States to pursue collective redress. The adoption of this right is important and awaited by thousands of Eu citizens, because, as the experience of recent years has shown, collective infringements of consumer rights continue to occur in many Member States, mainly through degression, aggressive marketing or other unlawful commercial practices.  In Poland, from where I am a member, there has been a high-profile recent case of massive breaches of consumer rights consisting in the unfair provision of mortgages indexed to a foreign currency or the frequent practice of selling products of under-quality. Thousands of citizens have suffered from these operations, and they have often caused human dramas and misfortunes.  In this context, I believe that the European Parliament should strongly support the solutions provided for in this directive, as they will make an important contribution to improving the level of protection of consumer rights.

A new tool will be created in EU law and, at the same time, in the law of EU Member States to improve consumer rights. Consumer organisations and independent authorities are given the right to represent and defend consumers' rights in court. This is particularly important if a large number of consumers are affected, but it may not be so large in financial terms that many consumers would be prepared to bring the matter to court on their own. There's strength in the group! This directive has emerged in response to a real need. Volkswagen's emissions scam left many car owners in a position where compensation should have been claimed directly from the Volkswagen Group. Volkswagen wasn't even the only car manufacturer that rigged car emissions. The EU's message is clear: the trampling of consumer rights is not accepted, and if there are no means of tackling, they will be created if necessary. I think this is just the beginning. In future, a class action would also allow victims of forced labour or trafficking in human beings, for example, to claim their rights as a group from a company that has committed human rights violations. That is something we should look into in the future. I am very pleased to have had the opportunity to participate in the legislative process from start to finish.

Une fois formellement adoptée et mise en œuvre, la directive relative aux actions représentatives offrira une protection solide aux consommateurs européens. Elle améliorera considérablement la mise en œuvre concrète des règles de protection des consommateurs dans toute l’Europe et pourrait ouvrir la voie à d’autres initiatives visant à améliorer l’accès à la justice dans d’autres domaines. Avec cette directive, nous envoyons un signal clair aux citoyens européens: l’Union européenne protège leurs intérêts et notamment leurs droits en tant que consommateur et l’accès à la justice. The directive creates a procedural mechanism of collective redress. It needs to respect the principle of procedural autonomy of the Member States, and their legal traditions. The objective was to allow the new mechanisms to be integrated as smoothly as possible in their national rules of civil procedure. On the other hand, the directive harmonises key aspects of the procedure ensuring a common denominator across the EU, in terms of both rights and safeguards. About the level of harmonisation, I want to add that with this directive the Commission always had the objective of preserving well-functioning national systems which can have different forms of collective redress. Member States can maintain existing systems and introduce new ones. The directive introduces a specific model of representative actions where qualified entities can seek injunctive and redress measures. Member States that already have representative actions have the choice to transpose this mechanism separately from the existing mechanism or to modify existing mechanisms to match the directive’s requirements.  When modifying existing mechanisms Member States have to introduce the missing elements, especially new elements that relate to cross-border actions. Importantly, the mutual recognition of qualified entities from other Member States should ensure for the purpose of cross-border actions under the conditions listed in the directive that this builds on the model already introduced by the Injunctions Directive.  Other features of the directive concerning, for example, the funding of actions or limitation periods may also require some modifications in Member States. However, the directive is not overly prescriptive. It provides the main elements of a general procedural framework but leaves the details to the national system in order to make the mechanism workable in practice. It is therefore likely that Member States only have to make a minimum of changes to their existing systems, and of course the Commission will assist the Member States throughout the transposition process, notably with dedicated workshops. Je voudrais conclure, Monsieur le Président, en remerciant une nouvelle fois le Parlement européen pour son engagement dans ce dossier et pour le débat que nous avons encore tenu ce matin. Je me réjouis de poursuivre notre excellente coopération dans les dossiers de protection des consommateurs, notamment dans la mise en œuvre du récent Agenda du consommateur, dont nous avons eu l’occasion de débattre hier soir.

The new collective redress rules would give consumers in all Member States the right to fight collective redress, but would also introduce safeguards to prevent abuse of this procedure. Particular attention should be paid to ensuring that the new provisions allow, in addition to general consumer laws, collective redress in cases where infringements are committed in areas such as data protection, financial services, travel and tourism, energy, telecommunications, environment and health, air and rail passenger rights. Most importantly, collective redress should be possible in all EU countries by allowing consumer organisations to represent citizens with the right to claim damages.

We had over 600 complex and often contradictory amendments, so it hasn’t been an easy process. I’d like especially to thank my own magnificent team, Megan, Lide and Eadaoin. I’d like to thank the Secretariat of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, and the staff in all of the political groups for their patience and professionalism. There’s no doubt about it. The Charter is an important document which contains rights which, if implemented, would allow all citizens to achieve their full potential and lead a dignified life. But we have to be honest about it: we’re a million miles away from that situation. Awareness of the Charter is low, there’s a total lack of integration in economic and political priorities, and even worse, in a whole number of Member States, fundamental rights are being attacked and undermined. So this report was an opportunity to step back, look at what’s going on and ask ourselves why. I’m very glad that we managed to hold on to a strong economic and social rights section at the start because, while fundamental rights are absolute in theory, if you don’t have a stable roof over your head or access to education or healthcare, well then you can only dream about having your rights protected. I’m glad that the report acknowledges the impact on inequality of cuts in public expenditure, but I’m sorry we couldn’t call it by its right name: austerity. I’m glad about the points about sexual and reproductive rights, about the pushbacks and the criminalisation of humanitarian action. But while acknowledging that, I deeply regret the weakness in this report because of our failure to come together and call out abuses and name countries – a shyness which is not replicated when we talk about countries outside of the EU. We have the absurdity now of a fundamental rights report where we’re not allowed to mention a country, not even in the body of the text, not even in a footnote if it comes from the Council of Europe and it has the name of a country in its title. Colleagues, this is utter madness. George Orwell said, ‘if liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear’. It is obvious that there are people in here who do not want to hear about Catalonia, and I am not surprised because it is an indictment on the Spanish State and the EU. But it’s a good example of the problem with this report because, instead of calling it out, as the Council of Europe has, we have a fundamental rights report that deals with freedom of expression, where the explanatory statement has been expunged for having the audacity to mention the fact that there are parliamentarians in prison with sentences of over 10 years for organising a democratic plebiscite. I’m sorry now but, if that doesn’t equal what the report condemns as the use of a judicial system for political purposes to silence an opposition, well I don’t know what does. But the big Groups didn’t want that. They couldn’t handle the truth so, after the committee vote, nine months after the explanatory statement was published, this statement, which was never voted upon, had to be banned. And you know I feel a bit like the author of The Joy of Sex, a book that was banned in Ireland and that no one had ever heard of until it was banned, and then everybody wanted it. So an explanatory statement that normally nobody ever cares about we’ve reproduced already as a booklet in English and in Spanish, and it’s currently being translated into Catalan. So thanks very much for that one. So fundamental rights should transcend self—interest and political game-playing. They should be the great equaliser, no matter who you are or what country you are. If we ignore that, it only leads us into a cul-de-sac of a fundamental rights report that deals with whistle-blowers and freedom of the press, but fails to mention Julian Assange and the dangerous precedent if the Trump Administration succeeds in its efforts to extradite him to the US and face 175 years in a high-security prison for journalism in the EU. The biggest press-freedom case of our generation and we are silent. I voted on this report going to plenary in the hope that sense would prevail and it would be improved here and issues like that put back. But if it’s not, I have no hesitation in voting against this report because it’s better that we would have no report than a weak or a hypocritical report. Maybe then we face the truth that, for all our talk about fundamental rights, we have had people on the streets of Bulgaria for months against a corrupt ruling party, fat on EU money. We have migrants left to rot and fester in camps, while boats of pregnant women and children are pushed out to sea by state forces in Greece. We have migrants raped with the branches of trees by state forces in Croatia. We have Muslims hounded in France. And, yes, we have parliamentarians in prison in Spain. So this is your Europe, and the choice is clear. We either waffle on in generalities about fundamental rights or we have the Charter implemented.

The Commission will propose in December a strategy to strengthen the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. Over the past decade, the Charter has led to a greater promotion and protection of people’s fundamental rights in the European Union. It has triggered new legislation directly protecting and promoting certain key rights. However, as proven by recent developments, fundamental rights, democracy or the rule of law cannot be taken for granted. They require EU citizens and ourselves to constantly stand up for those principles. Allow me to reflect on several issues raised by the report. First, on the importance of a comprehensive approach to combat discrimination, exclusion, prejudice or hate speech and hate crime. The Commission has renewed its efforts to ensure the correct transposition of the framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia. The commitment to tackle serious manifestations of racism is one of the main pillars of the Commission’s Anti-racism Action Plan adopted on 18 September and we have to go further.  By the end of the next year, the Commission will take an initiative to extend the list of EU crimes under the EU Treaty to all forms of hate crime and hate speech. This will give us a legal basis for legislative action. In parallel to strengthening our legal framework we need to fight stereotypes and bias and promote diversity and inclusion policies. One cannot succeed without the other.  The plan for the actions that need to be taken by the Commission and the Member States are reflected in our strategic documents adopted since the Commission took its mandate which were: Gender Equality Strategy; LGBTIQ Strategy; the already mentioned EU Anti-racism Action Plan; and on the reinforced EU Roma Inclusion Strategic Framework. And we are working on strengthening media freedom and pluralism as addressed during Monday’s debate on the Adamowicz report. The Commission is currently finalising a European Democracy Action Plan, which will focus on elections integrity, media freedom and media pluralism and tackling disinformation. When delivering on the Democracy Action Plan we will explore the issue of strategic lawsuits against public participation and present in 2021 an initiative against abusive litigation targeting journalists and rights’ defenders.  The Commission is aware that civil society and rights’ defenders are facing pressures and obstacles in certain Member States. Ensuring an enabling a supportive environment for these actors is one of the focal points of our upcoming strategy to strengthen the application of the Charter of Fundamental Rights in the EU. We welcome the increase in the budget of the rights and values programme in the Multiannual Financial Framework, which will be useful in that regard.  The Commission shares your concerns about the protection of the most vulnerable people, such as children in poverty or people with no access to adequate housing. We will continue to support Member States in their efforts. The forthcoming EU Child Guarantee and EU Rights of the Child Strategy will address the special needs of the children in 2021.  With regard to your concerns about the situation of migrants and the push-backs at some borders, I would like to underline that the Charter applies to Member States when they are implementing EU migration law. It is imperative that measures taken by border guards to protect the external borders are taken in respect of fundamental rights and international law, in particular, the principle of non-refoulement and the access to asylum procedures. It is necessary also to show solidarity to the Member States on the EU’s external borders, whose concerns need to be heard and discussed. The new Pact on migration and asylum presented on 23 September strengthens the protection of fundamental rights and ensures that any allegations of breaches are properly investigated.  Adherence to the principles is strongly reflected in our new Action Plan on integration and inclusion, which focuses on both migrants and EU citizens with a migrant background. It aims to ensure effective integration and inclusion as it is a social and economic investment that makes European societies more cohesive, resilient and more prosperous. Last, but not least, I would like to underline that the Commission is committed to upholding the rule of law in the Union by all the means at its disposal. It is a precondition for the respect of fundamental rights. We fully agree with the European Parliament with regard to the importance of strengthening the EU’s capacity to monitor the respect of the common values on which the EU is founded.  On 30 September we presented the first annual rule of law report at the centre of the new Comprehensive European Rule of Law Mechanism. One of its objectives is to strengthen interinstitutional cooperation on the rule of law matters and to trigger an inclusive debate at European and national level.

I cannot fail to recall how Ján Kuciak, a Slovak journalist whose murder caused a deep political crisis, culminated in the resignation of the Prime Minister, was killed in 2018. A few months earlier, Daphne Caruana Galizia had been murdered in Malta, with the involvement of government circles, which also led to the resignation of the Prime Minister. Defending the rule of law also means defending the freedom of the press, anytime, anywhere. Today, the health and economic crisis caused by COVID-19 is putting a strain on European citizens by threatening other fundamental rights, from health to work and freedom of enterprise. Only if we start from our fundamental values, leaving no one behind, will we be able to live up to the task we have at this historic stage. We have seen how fragile the European Union is. It is our responsibility to ensure that projects soon move on to concrete action, families and businesses can no longer wait.

This is the place where we receive more than 2000 petitions every year, and I have to say that Europeans are pretty much aware of their rights, obligations and possibilities.  And there is a document to which they refer fairly often and this is the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. But, during my six years in the Committee on Petitions, I can barely remember only one or two petitioners who were aware that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights is pretty much limited by Article 51, which means that national governments have to follow the Charter of Fundamental Rights only if they are implementing European law. If it comes to national issues this is not the case. It is very sad that again and again, we have to write to petitioners and say, look, we understand your problem, we see that something is wrong, but we can do nothing because of Article 51 in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  I believe that in this House, it is high time to start this debate and I know that several years ago, there was already a resolution in this House that we have to think about Article 51, but it never happened, unfortunately. And I believe that this is not right. The second document to which they refer also a lot, is the European Pillar of Social Rights, which was adopted exactly three years ago on 17 November 2017 and is still not implemented. We have to move forward, otherwise, if we do not meet the expectations of Europeans, I do not predict a bright future for the European Union.

Our human rights standards are today, with little doubt, the highest in the world. Violations of those rights, however, still exist in many different areas, especially among vulnerable groups such as women, children in poverty, and people with disabilities. Our responsibility is to clearly address this and suggest ways to improve their protection 10 years after the entry into force of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. This annual report is meant to monitor the progress of fundamental rights in Europe, showing how the Charter has been taken into account, but also identifying current trends and areas for further improvement.  The protection of universal human rights should certainly not be a point for ideological battles. Personal political convictions should not overshadow an inclusive and objective evaluation of human rights in Europe. A good example of this need for a universal and comprehensive approach is the issue of migration. We need to strongly support the fundamental right to seek asylum, but we cannot ignore the need to fight human smuggling or the need to comply with international and Union law.

While I hoped that I wouldn’t need to give this specific one, I need to do it out of necessity, after the speech of the rapporteur. When we are negotiating important reports such as this one, it is of most importance that we weigh every word, we double-check all the facts, and we don’t choose what to include based on political self-interest: rather, out of total necessity due to the reality we are faced with during the period the report concerns. Otherwise, we undermine the trust in the report. I was therefore happy when the rapporteur and we shadows agreed on some overall structures: to only name countries where we can lean against the judicial process or decision – otherwise we risk to end up with a country catalogue rather than a report with a focus on fundamental rights breaches. And that we have the right balance between social and civil rights, because one should not forget that the right to housing is equally as important as the right to, for example, an independent and free judicial system. Our EU citizens need them both to be fully free. Furthermore, no EU citizen should be limited in living a happy life through being faced with discrimination or racism, which we unfortunately see more and more of. LGBT-free free zones, attacks on independent and free media, demonisation of migrants and people of migrant backgrounds, shrinking space and limitation of women’s rights to their own bodies are some of the attacks on fundamental rights we are seeing in our Member States, in some much more than others. Finally, in the political family I belong to, the outcome of discussions and negotiations is important. If we don’t agree, we highlight it in the negotiations, to give a heads-up, because we know that negotiations are all about giving and taking. To sneak in issues in the Explanatory Statement that one has no majority for, as rapporteur, is for me not working. This is not a game, this is real people’s lives we are talking about.

We have worked without fainting, like the Socialists, like other Members, to have an acceptable text for approval. And it has not been easy, because the text was based on ideological biases and, moreover, because, as the Socialist Member has said, things have to be shown to her face and not try to do tricks.  Let's try to get a text that is up to what the House requires, with majority, with firm reasons. The report adopted in committee calls for the constant monitoring of fundamental rights against abuse and discrimination, in our societies, by state or non-state powers.  Emphasize the right to non-demeaning treatment of migrants who come to our territory, to ensure the most vulnerable , especially children – and the right to health of the most vulnerable women, because all socially unfavourable conditions and stigmatization make them the pasture of predators or discrimination, such as in Moria.  Go our commitment to discrimination against women in the Roma minority, or to the chapter on freedom of expression, because hate speech is normalizing in our societies and is polarizing undemocratically, and there is a lot of masked populism and there is a lot of attack on journalists.  I am pleased to have included in this report the mention of the victims of terrorism , although there are some groups that intend to eliminate it – their double victimization: the tribute to the terrorists for having been.

Even in the Socialist Party, to which she then joined, they did not want to have her later – not even there. We therefore have a rapporteur who has been or is a supporter of Trotskyism, that is to say, the most extreme form of communism, which is already the most extreme, which clearly stands for anti-democratic, anti-pluralist and anti-freedom regimes, and who has thus openly fought against the European values that this report is about for decades. And such a person is serious about becoming rapporteur on the situation of fundamental rights in Europe? You can't imagine it!

A report that makes no mention of the infiltrated Muslim terrorism, as if the mass murders of recent years are not the most fundamental threat to European fundamental rights. A report that spit spat spat in the face of all Jews when it pretends that Islam and anti-Semitism have nothing to do with each other. A report that seriously treats housing shortages and unemployment as violations of fundamental rights, but does not want to see an attack on freedom of expression in the Muslim attack on Charlie Hebdo or Samuel Paty, in the nice murders. This report is a document of failure – by Clare Daly, but also by the LIBE Committee, because Daly's failure was foreseeable. This report is left-wing, and above all it is a disgrace.

But the report we are debating today shows that fundamental rights cannot be guaranteed in Europe. The text warns of rising levels of poverty and exclusion, attacks on women's rights and lives, hate speech against minorities, and reminds us of our obligation to respect the rights of those who come to Europe in search of refuge or a more dignified life.  The report also highlights democratic setbacks that concern us. It denounces the violation of basic rights such as freedom of expression or assembly, and calls into question the separation of powers and judicial independence of the Member States. We are or might be comfortable with this text, but at the same time we are concerned about important aspects. On the one hand, the large groups continue to block any mention of the Member States in this report, and in addition, the president of the LIBE Commission, at the request of some parties, has removed the rapporteur's explanal statement, in which he referred, indirectly, to police violence in Catalonia and to the imprisonment of Catalan leaders, a decision that has been taken overnight and for reasons of domestic policy. A explana course reflecting what has already been denounced by the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights and Amnesty International, among others. We regret that, precisely when we are debating a report on fundamental rights, we must condemn an act of censure and an exercise in political cynicism like this within the European Parliament. After all, it may be true that no State needs to be named: they alone are singled out. For all this, I call on the President of Parliament to review what has happened and to protect the freedom of political expression of Members of the European Parliament in the exercise of his mandate.

The origin is well known where it is: austere policies; but it is also booming in the far right, and not only where they govern, but also here, every time they manage to set their political agenda. All you have to do is look at immigration policy. All you have to do is see Lesbos or the Balkan border, the Mediterranean, you only have to see the Canary Islands, different places, same effects and consequences: human pain, violation of rights. Perhaps taking advantage of the view that we talk about this report, we should look at ourselves: don't you think the guarantor of these rights should be the EU? Us?  My feeling is that we do not act as we should, that we even buy the delirium of the far right: to defend the European way of life. Remember. Thus we begin by buying the story of an avalanche that does not exist, because you know—like me—that the figures denies that statement. We know this because the International Organization for Migration tells us that fewer migrants arrive in Europe every year, and they know – like me – that Lesbos and the Canary Islands are the consequence of the blocking policy, of keeping them trapped in the places of arrival, which is also unfair, moreover, to host populations, such as the Canarian population, because they are very often overwhelmed after years of cuts.

On the immigration side you take issue with those who defend borders, security and national sovereignty, such as Matteo Salvini. You talk about the criminalisation of solidarity, against rejections against the law, about racist policies that violate human rights, but no words of condemnation against human traffickers, against those who promote illegal immigration, against NGOs that systematically violate national laws, and not even anything against those who, through the business of reception, profit on migrants to enrich themselves. There is even a passage in the report against police officers and their abuse. You say that the use of force must be restricting in order to avoid disproportionate reactions, but not a reference to the violence that men and women in uniform suffer every day.

This is also served, among other things, by the annual reports on the state of fundamental rights in the European Union. This one takes up different topics and, yes, puts his finger in the right wound at different points. What bothers me, however, is that the report is partly skewed, partly oversubscribed, and the Union sometimes arrests for things that are either not solely in its power to shape, where the Union is struggling intensively to improve or where the Union has already agreed on decisive improvement. In so doing, the report gives the impression of an inescapable fate, of an immutable state of affairs, and thus plays into the hands of the very actors who are directed against Europe anyway. At the same time, it accepts to further restrict the scope for action on essential issues.  Take the example of security, an issue that has not only moved our citizens to the European elections, which – without having to look into the glass sphere – has certainly not lost its relevance in 2020. In the report, the subject appears mainly from the point of view of freedom and data protection. However, this is a slippery slope, because we cannot play security off against data protection. We need a balance between these important goods. Terrorist content online, the protection of children from abuse and the spread of online representations, abuses on the Internet, hate speech and the resulting acts are just the latest examples of this. Data protection must never become the protection of perpetrators.  Politics begins with the consideration of reality. And this reality is never one-sided and tendentious, it is complex, complex and differentiated. Our ambition should be no less than that.

Indeed, I would like to remind you that our society has a duty to protect our children and I would particularly like to draw your attention to the sexual crimes against children who are victims and which are on the rise. This Parliament, in defence of fundamental rights, must set clear objectives on the protection of our children. Firstly, by setting a European age of sexual consent which will de facto lead to a single definition of rape of minors in the Member States. Currently, depending on the country, this sexual majority varies from 14 to 18 years, so there is a need for harmonization of the age of consent. Secondly, the European Union must rule against the correction of cases of rape of minors. In France, as in many Member States, several paedophile acts against minors, which are crimes, are reclassified as a misdemeanour under the charge of sexual assault allowing the victim's consent to be invoked. Under no circumstances can a child under the age of 15 be considered consenting. Finally, like a file of perpetrators of terrorist acts, a European file of perpetrators of sexual offences and violence against children must be created, which would enable European police to cooperate better.

In fact, a serious backlash against women’s and LGBTI rights has ensued, with anti-gender movements trying to limit sexual and reproductive health and rights. And the Covid crisis has not been helping at all. According to a Fundamental Rights Agency report, nearly 17 million women in the EU experienced either physical or sexual violence over the period of 12 months preceding the survey. Those numbers are absolutely unacceptable, and we must begin to realise that gender-based violence is both the consequence and one of the causes of persisting gender inequalities. Unfortunately, some Member States are champions in maintaining these fundamental inequalities between men and women, and as long as Member States promote campaigns against the Istanbul Convention, and as long as the Council blocks directives on equal treatment of women on boards, I am afraid progress will remain limited.

Mr President, Commissioner, Madam Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, so are elections, so is politics, much like all shows: you can choose the corner of the projector. We can decide to shed some light on certain facts, we can decide to leave others in the shadows and finally talk only about what suits us or, on the contrary, what we want to criticize. We have tried with my colleagues in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and I would like to pay tribute to them, to leave nothing aside and to have a balanced position between what we have enjoyed in these elections and what has made us less satisfied. I'd still like to start by taking a look in the rearview mirror. Where do we come from? It is 2019 and we are talking about the direct universal suffrage election of the European Parliament. We are 40 years after the creation of this Parliament. We are almost at the birth of this parliamentary democracy in Europe. Let us all keep in mind that we are moving forward, that our democracy is progressing, and that this Parliament was originally not elected by universal suffrage and was composed of representatives of national parliaments. So we have taken a very important step and this election has reinforced this progress. The first thing I want to emphasize, of course, is participation. Everyone was pleased with the increase in participation. We have more than 50% turnout in these European elections and, when I hear everywhere that Europe does not represent directly, etc., I say that it is more than 200 million, I mean 200 million European citizens, who voted in the European elections. We all had dark circles a few days or weeks ago, watching American channels to try to find out the outcome of the elections in the United States. We have 30 million more voters who elect our Parliament. So let us not be modest: let us accept the fact that European democracy is strong, that it is progressing and that, yes, citizens are interested in its future, it is very important. It is also very important to note that this turnout has increased, because young people have appropriated this election. And if young people have appropriated this election - this is the point I want to emphasise and I am obviously turning to the opponents of the European Union - it is because they believe that the European level is the right lever to respond to difficulties and crises, but also to address the issues to come. On climate issues, on security issues, on issues of democracy and human rights, on social issues, Europe's youth have understood that we will only be able to resolve these issues through our continental power and not simply in the withdrawals of identity and national issues. And that is indeed very important. However, participation is not equal everywhere and it must be noted that in some states participation is still very low. We must improve this situation, we must continue to communicate, we must ensure that democracy is progressing uniformly throughout the European Union. But, as I said, we have some good news. We also have less good ones. As I said, some countries are not mobilising around the European election, but we also have a whole part of the European population who cannot take part in these elections. I am talking about the weakest people, the people with disabilities. In some countries, it is extremely difficult to vote. I am talking about some communities that cannot freely access the right to vote in some European countries, this is unacceptable, it has to change. We also have to see the lack of diversity in our Parliament. Of course we have to make progress on this issue, there is a whole part of the European population that is not represented in our institutions, that has to change.  This must also change for diversity and gender equality. Yes, there is a progression, from 37 to 41 per cent of women in this Parliament. Yes, it is an increase, but 41% is still far from the 51% or 52% that we should reach. So that's a goal, you have to do it. We must indeed ensure that this Parliament has a real, effective parity between women and men.  And then analysing a situation is good, but I will end by saying that we also have to make proposals. I talked about the good news, but there is a bad one: the principle of the top candidate has not, as it stands, been understood by the Voters. Just 8% of European voters said that this question of the top candidate was at the heart of their vote. We must therefore move forward, reflect on the capacity that parliamentary democracy can implement so that European citizens actually vote for a European candidate. And here we must have the courage to debate all subjects such as transnational lists, the single constituency, is it not Mrs Jourov, it is in your portfolio, these are subjects which we must debate without fear, without fear, simply because they are at the heart of European democracy. There are many other subjects, Mr President, but I will stop there.

We share the aspiration expressed in the report to strengthen the European dimension of the European elections and to promote broad and inclusive participation in European democracy.  In June 2020, the Commission published its own report on the 2019 elections. The report looked at the conduct of the last European elections and analysed measures taken to enhance transparency, to protect free and fair elections, and to promote the democratic participation of all EU citizens, to strengthen the European dimension of the elections, and to ensure resilient electoral processes. It was based on substantial input received from Member States authorities, in particular from the European Cooperation Network on Elections and the Expert group on electoral matters.  Our findings have shown that young and first-time voters drove turnout figures to a record high, the first increase since the 1970s and the highest in 25 years. It was also an election where the institutions and Member States cooperated closely and effectively to communicate with citizens. A dynamic European debate emerged on a number of topics showing progress in developing a European political dimension. In the report, the Commission announced that it would continue to intensify its communication activities, to support inclusion policies and to engage with the Member States in the framework of the European Cooperation Network on Elections, on best practices in this area, including on data and reporting. The network in fact already touched on these subjects at its most recent meetings in July and September, and also discussed practices and experience in adapting elections and democracy to the post-COVID environment, which was warmly welcomed by Member States and which will continue.  We also indicated some opportunities for European political parties to support the effort to increase turnout, in particular through communications efforts, to increase inclusive participation, and through awareness-raising about the elections, and how the EU works.  In the next week, the Commission will adopt the European Democracy Action Plan. In this plan, we aim to protect our European democracies against today’s challenges and make them more resilient in order to ensure that citizens are able to participate in the democratic systems through informed decision-making free from unlawful interference and manipulation. The Action Plan will focus on safeguarding the integrity of our elections, on countering disinformation and on supporting free and independent media, and also build on the lessons learned from the ongoing COVID-19 crisis.  It will also cover active citizenship and strengthening of civil society. The international dimension of these initiatives is a thread running through the whole plan. It will announce legislative proposals to ensure greater transparency of paid political advertising, alongside non-legislative measures and further initiatives to tackle disinformation and to protect the media. I am glad that the Durand Report focuses also on institutional matters such as the lead candidate. With the upcoming European Parliament reports and the hopefully soon to be launched Conference on the Future of Europe, we will be able to discuss together with citizens and Member States the shape of the next elections. Let me repeat that I remain ready to act as an honest broker in this field where the Commission’s initiative, as you know, is limited. From our side, we are ready to join the debate and to make available legal and institutional expertise, research on electoral processes and insight into interinstitutional relations if this Parliament and the Council deem it useful. I would also like to mention two of the files where the Commission has the right of initiative. The Regulation on the Statute and funding of the European political parties and foundations. As announced in the work programme for the next year, we will propose a revision aiming for clearer rules, for instance on the financing. We will also propose legislation to ensure greater transparency of paid political advertising, alongside non-legislative measures, ensuring transparency and accountability, in particular online, is essential. All this with a view to adoption well in time ahead of the 2024 elections.

The past European elections left important lessons to be learned. For the first time we have seen a significant increase in participation. Contrary to what Eurosceptics say, Europe matters to citizens. However, although moderate and pro-European parties have clearly won the elections, many citizens preferred populist and nationalist options, something we respect but should be concerned about. On the other hand, the main candidate system has failed, because of the Council's refusal to accept as President of the Commission the person who won the elections and because we were not able to defend him. The overall assessment of elections is positive, European democracy works, but there are many things that can be done better.  We all agree that sooner sooner sooner without later, the European Union will have to face its own democratic revolution and, if it does not do so out of conviction, it will have to do so out of necessity.  The world in which we live is very little like the world we knew only a decade ago, when we signed the Lisbon Treaty. Leaving the pandemic aside, in 2000, for example, few could imagine that in the 21st century nationalist movements, populist movements, economic protectionism and political authoritarianism would resurface. Just like a hundred years ago. Few could imagine that, within the European Union, we would have to go out again in defence of freedom of the press, the rule of law, the rights of women or those who are persecuted for their sexual orientation or for their religion. Few could imagine that something as far-fetched as Brexit could happen.  We had taken refuge in the economy, we had left behind principles and values, thinking that others would defend them for us. We were wrong. When authoritarianism is growing in the world, our silence does not make us victims, but accomplices.  Europe is neither a state nor aspires to be a state. If the policy and pressure of national governments does not prevent it, next year we will hold a Conference on the Future of Europe in which all the points in this report will be on the table; for example, Europe's aspiration to become a federation with a representative government and a bicameral parliament of citizens and states.

Since 1979, participation in the European elections has always fallen. Last year, however, the trend reversed: there was the highest participation rate in twenty years. The announced breakthrough of eurosceptic forces has not happened. A new interest in the European Union has developed, it has grown. The citizens of Europe still believed in the integration project and went to the polls convinced that their vote could be the engine of change. It is now up to us to proceed along the path they have shown us. We cannot disappoint those who still look to a united Europe, a Europe that believes in solidarity, in the rule of law, in the ability to face and overcome the great global challenges. Our task is also to rekindle hopes where they had died. Progress has been made in this year and a half. Compared with the last parliamentary term, the number of Members has increased. I appreciate and appreciate the Commission's female leadership, but the road to real equality is still too long. Only 5 % of Members belong to a minority, yet they make up 10 % of the European population. The vote has often been denied to inmates and the homeless. Some 800 000 disabled people were unable to vote because of problems with access to seats. Here, the report on the 2019 elections examines the past and the present, but looks above all to the future.

Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Pascal Durand on his balanced and ambitious report. There is, however, one major point: these European elections are still too little European. Despite a higher turnout, the debates remain stuck in a purely national pen in the 27 member countries. Let's be on this election! I'd say, let's put the church back in the middle of the village. For an accomplished European democracy, it is essential to promote a genuine transnational political space. There is no real European political movement today. Yet imagine the impact in terms of strength and legitimacy. It is remember that it was above all to solve these problems that the idea of transnational lists was born. Let us promote a genuinely European debate through the emergence of transnational political movements with visions and programmes on the Union and directly elected by citizens. Let us be ambitious for May 2024 and double the democratic choices of the citizens. They will be able to vote for a national list and a transnational list. It is a question of legitimacy, it is a question of democracy, it is a question of visibility so that citizens understand what they are doing. So, Mr President, let us stop pretending, we want to have leading candidates for the presidency of the European Commission. Therefore, logic would have it that, in order to achieve this objective, it is essential to have lists. The agreement reached at the beginning of this Parliament provided for work on improving the top-of-the-list system, but also for implementing transnational lists. The two go hand in hand: no top of the list, no list, I would say.

Mr President, this report – and I am sorry to assume that the rapporteur will rather take this as a compliment – is for the time being the most extremist document produced by the centralist, federalist and 'Europeanist' elite within this European Parliament during this parliamentary term.  Firstly, the document is bulging with the confusion that is very common in the circles of extremist supporters of the European Union between Europe, the continent, the type of civilisation, the cultural data on the one hand, and the European Union on the other. I call myself a supporter of Europe, a representative of European cultural identity, founded on the added value of the differences. In my view, however, the European Union is only an institution, an organisation and a way of working together agreed by a treaty between independent Member States.  The proponents of pushing a European Union as a comprehensive and as comprehensive unitary state as possible have appropriated the broad and rich concept of Europe, invariably call their European Union 'Europe', and their actions and their expansions of powers invariably 'European', usually followed by a noun: European health care, European single currency, European immigration, European economy, in all cases they call European progress , and today here a real European electoral law.  Of course full of the time-honoured dadas proclaimed here, as if it were the ten commandments that Moses – mr Durand in this case in this case – brought from the mountain. The territory of the European Union as a single electoral definition. One general electoral list – the transnational list. The Member States will be abolished, because in the European Union the Member States will no longer be the Council of the European Union, but a subordinate second legislative chamber, a kind of advisory body of this Parliament. The national political parties are gradually being replaced by transnational European political parties, which will logically have only one programme and may have only one programme later: the programme of further integration of this European Union. In short, ladies and gentlemen, the extremism of the European Union is at a new high today.

I want to remind everyone in this House that this House already decides on laws that affect 450 million Europeans and maybe potentially many more across the world. I hope that at one point this House will also be able to initiate laws and will field a European government, hopefully. This House is already a beacon of European democracy and I think it’s really important that we try to increase legitimacy and that we try to improve the way we are elected into this House, at all times. I think the report shows ways to do this.  First of all, I think it’s very important that we set minimum standards to ensure that there’s a trusted process. That means minimum standards when it comes to the registration of a party, when it comes to the registration of this party for the European parliamentary elections, when it comes to internal party democracy about how to field candidates, when it comes to party financing and fraud control, and when it comes to the election procedures at the actual election date.  Second, and this has already been mentioned by some colleagues, we need to Europeanise these elections. It’s not enough that we all work in our national context to try to put forward European topics. We need to have an actual European debate about European topics and I think there are some ways to discuss this further, as has been discussed for transnationalist Spitzenkandidaten. But we should also try to regionalise and localise the elections so that parliamentarians are closer to their citizens as much as possible, so that people have some people to relate to and to reach out to.  I think we should not shy away from any of these discussions. We should discuss all the options on the table to be able to improve our electoral procedures. When we look across the Atlantic, I think we can see how important it is to have trusted procedures, especially when it comes to the transition of powers.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you Pascal Durand for this very good report. I wanted to talk to you about my little cousin Clotilde, who's 16. She has participated in all the climate protests for a year and family meals, you can't stop her when she starts trying to convince the whole family of the ecological emergency. Clotilde has a strong opinion about society, but yet, when it is election day, she has no right to speak at the ballot box. I also wanted to talk to you about Lorenzo, who is 16 years old. He's Italian. He has the right to open his own clothing store, he even has the right to be the owner of a restaurant. On the other hand, voting is niente, forbidden at his age. I wanted to talk to you about 16-year-old Tobias. He's German. He has the right to buy beer, he is allowed to go out in a disco with his friends of 16 years, but he is not allowed to vote. I'll also tell you about Carmen, who is 16. She's Spanish. She works 40 hours a week and has the right to get married. Yet she is not allowed to vote, nor is she. Clotilde, Lorenzo, Tobias, Carmen and then the majority of 16-year-olds in Europe get involved. They are committed to the climate, to equality between women and men, but they do not have the right to participate in democracy, they do not have the right to elect the representatives who will decide how life should be organized in the society in which they live. You know, before women had the right to vote, before the under-21s had the right to vote, they were said to be, they were told, to justify their exclusion from political life, that their too low maturity of mind could not allow them to take an intelligent part in the conduct of public affairs. It seems obsolete when you say that, yet these are the same arguments that we hear here about the right to vote at 16. So I would like to ask those who oppose the idea of the right to vote at 16, are you not afraid to end up with a Hemicycle transformed by the arrival in the polls, because of the arrival in the polling stations of Clotilde, Lorenzo, Tobias, Carmen and all the others?

Second, Oriol Junqueras, my former colleague in government, is still in jail and was condemned to 13 years behind bars, despite his being an elected MEP. The Spanish Supreme Court did not care about this or about his immunity and violated the rights of MEPs. This is a shame. All MEPs should defend the right of Oriol Junqueras to be an MEP by voting for Amendment 49. Electoral rules cannot depend on Member States. Today it is Spain, tomorrow, who knows?

I agree with him only on one point. Like him, I welcome the increased participation in the elections, which is an encouraging sign of renewed interest in the democratic process. But I disagree on the explanation of this renewed interest. In France, the reason voters have moved is not because the eu's costly and unnecessary 'I vote' campaign has paid off, it is because they have become passionate about the struggle that the two main lists have been engaged in. That of Jordan Bardella and the National Rally finally triumphed over that of the President of the Republic, Emmanuel Macron. As for drawing from this renewed participation the lesson of citizens' accession to the Union, it is very presumptuous, because in the aftermath of the yellow vest revolt, many voters voted instead to show their distrust of the ultraliberalism of the Union, which they rightly consider to be co-responsible for their misfortune. In an aggravating circumstance, the Durand report not only takes stock of the elections, it takes the pretext of drawing the outline of the reforms which, in his opinion, would improve the Union. But the dream he describes is, in my eyes, a nightmare. The report aims to strengthen the Commission's political role, particularly through the consecration of the top candidate system. On the other hand, I would rather remove any political role from the Commission by transforming it into a mere permanent technical secretariat. The report wants to marginalize the Council by turning it into a second chamber, that is, a kind of Senate. On the other hand, I would rather strengthen his role by entrusting him with the legislative initiative. The report aims to transform the European Parliament into a representative of an untraceable European people with transnational lists, unified electoral law and the creation of a European electoral authority. On the other hand, I would rather think about how to make it more representative of European nations.

And that context of that election was the context of crises, Brexit, the migrant crisis. And in this context, I would like to underline that we have seen a historic mobilisation, a historic turnout in this election. Indeed, after 20 years, it has increased significantly throughout the European Union. In my own country, Slovakia, the turnout was 10% higher than in the past. And that turnout was the mobilisation of pro-European forces, the populists did not win, pro-European forces prevailed, hope for the future of the European project prevailed. And it's important that we keep that hope going. That is why we need to launch a Conference on the Future of Europe as soon as possible and a debate, an honest debate with our citizens and voters, in order to mobilise them further in the context of the next elections, but also in relation to why we have a European project here. The European project is there for the people. The pandemic shows us the benefits of the European project, the added value of the recovery fund, as well as the debate on the health union. All this must be the agenda of the Conference on the Future of Europe in order to further mobilise voters and citizens across the European Union in the context of the next European elections.

I can only regret that in an otherwise very comprehensive text we spent so much political effort trying to revive an idea that this House voted down – and with good reason – and I am speaking about the transnational lists. Parliament is often perceived as a political entity that is distant from the everyday concerns of citizens. Every second colleague quoted already that in the last European Parliament elections turnout was the highest since 1994 and it was 8 per cent up compared to 2014, so bringing Parliament even closer to citizens works already. Making citizens vote for people they do not know, who do not know them, do not understand their culture, do not speak their language, will certainly not represent an impetus for further steps in that direction. In addition, elections without a local constituency would not ensure accountability to voters. It would weaken the link between Members and their electorate and would also favour large Member States and large parties. Elections for Parliament should be made more European, focusing not on electoral engineering and lists, but on proposing truly European answers to European questions, rather than national priorities.  On the other hand, I am very disappointed that the final report did not address vital issues such as electoral thresholds. Colleagues already mentioned the high threshold can be an effective barrier for smaller groups such as parties representing national minorities running in single national constituencies.

It is a continent of nation states and unique people who share a lot of history and values and ways of thinking and being in the world.

The EUROPEAN Union is now made up of 27 countries. 27 unique nations that are very similar and in healthy competition for the most part, making the EU, overall, the most dynamic, innovative and economic muscle in the world, especially the green transition and democracy.

I am thinking of the report prepared by Mr Durand on the analysis of the European elections. As many good collegiates have already pointed out, I am very critical of the so-called Pan-European electoral lists. Such lists would obviously be too much for the smaller Member States, as candidates from these Member States would not have the opportunity to compete equally against candidates from the major Member States. In my opinion, the voting activity in the European Parliament elections is very directly linked to the possibility for voters from their home countries to choose from their own country the people who are known, known and valued to represent themselves. If you take this opportunity away from the electorate, the European Union will become even more distant and distance itself from its citizens. I am absolutely convinced that playing with an idea such as pan-European electoral lists is irresponsible and dangerous. I very much hope that, in the interests of a better future for the European Union, we will stop discussing this issue and focus on real issues. Finally, I would like to express my opposition to the idea of a single election. While I understand that this is aimed at involving young people, this initiative must come from the Member States and be in line with national electoral law.

Well, we are speaking here today about reflections on the 2019 elections. Let me say what I didn’t say at the beginning and maybe also the reflections from the Commission’s side – how we were preparing for the elections. After the lessons we learned from the 2016 American elections, from the Brexit campaign and from some other elections, we knew that to organise the elections, to be fair and free, and free from manipulation, and free from different new kinds of threat, it wouldn’t be business as usual. We focused in the preparation on three new emerging threats. The first was abuse of private data in political campaigns. After the Cambridge Analytica case it was clear that we had to react. So we mobilised the data protection authorities in the Member States to pay special attention to the possible cases of abuse of private data and micro-targeting in political campaigning. The second threat was disinformation. We mobilised colleagues dealing with disinformation on a national level. We created the rapid alert system to address or to stop a coordinated strong attack from outside Europe – and just to mention that we did not trigger the rapid alert system, but we were prepared for that. And the third threat was the possible endangering of the elections by cyber-attacks. So we again asked the Member States to strengthen their infrastructure to be able to protect the elections against that. To manage all these new threats and to be well prepared, we established the national elections system and network. We had all the Member States, represented by the people who organised the elections, it proved to be very useful. The network is still working and it will work further in the future, because all the measures we took for the European elections proved to be extremely useful for organising national elections. So we are working together with the Member States. Well, the reflections on the elections with regard to the results, are, as far as I see it, quite positive. We saw that especially young people showed us that they are interested in the future of Europe – that Europe matters. This is very good news. And I think that in everything we are doing we should continue to support this trend. We have to invite young people to the elections. I cannot help it, we have to do something which I sometimes call ‘to digitalise democracy’, because young people are not interested in using the old-fashioned methods. So maybe we should consider the possibility to introduce more digital innovations in the methods and in the way we elect in Europe. And we have to start discussions as soon as possible under the Conference on the Future of Europe, which was mentioned here many times – Katarina Barley said that it should be mainly an exercise that involves listening. We should listen to what people see as good solutions for the future of Europe. Now we know that the people care and that we have to open a very wide discussion with the citizens, not only remain in the bubble where we are normally used to discussing these things. So, the conference should start as soon as possible when COVID enables us to move. We can do a lot of things through digital instruments but not everything is possible. Last comment: if we want to change something in the electoral system for 2024, needless to say here that the initiative is on the European Parliament, not the Commission. I have counted the days and months before the elections and well, if we want to introduce changes, we will have to see the initiatives on the table next year. So I can only repeat from this place that I am ready to cooperate, the Commission is going to play the role of the honest broker in this process, and I’m very much looking forward to the next debates on this and also the real steps we are going to take.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 100, "date": "2020-11-24.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has It is, of course, now clear that trade policy is shaping the future. Among many other policy areas, trade policy is a material opportunity to shape the future. I believe that we have recently seen very clearly how much these possibilities for action in trade policy have been called into question. We have seen many national singular measures taken, which have acted completely contrary to international rules, national reflexes, unilateral measures. We have seen that in the Corona pandemic supply chains have been in shock, broken off and have caused economic and political consequences. We have seen more and more people asking: who benefits from this trade policy? Is this really in our interest with globalisation or only in the interests of a few? So the values of the European Union are also being asked in trade policy. That is why our question is yes: how can we shape trade policy in the future so that we can get answers to these challenges? We discussed this very intensively in the Committee on Trade and also presented a number of points which should be a step forward for the Commission to review the trade policy strategy. I would also say that this is not a wish list for Santa Claus, even though we are now just before Christmas, but that is already a strategic option with two lines. One line is more the proactive line, and the other line is more the defensive line, the defense line. These two lines are reflected in many points.  Let me just mention four points briefly. I believe that we must be proactive in the WTO in order to supplement the WTO's regulatory framework, supplementing it with the question of state-owned enterprises, with the issue of the protection of intellectual property. Above all, however, we must approach and get the SDGs, the United Nations SDGs, into the WTO, so that trade policy on a global scale also serves the implementation of sustainability strategies. I hope that we can work hard with the United States, with Mr Biden's administration and with Mr Kerry as climate envoy. Perhaps this too may be a starting point for enhanced cooperation in the multilateral system, in order to set more rules here in order to move forward. Secondly, I believe that we also need a clear focus on the issue of supply chains. We see that supply chains are very sensitive, that they are sometimes not robust enough to absorb shocks. However, we also see that supply chains are unfair, that the risk is passed on to the last of the chain. That is why I believe that it is right – and this is also reflected in the proposal – to introduce a binding European supply chain law, which provides for due diligence for companies operating in the European internal market, so that we do not see this cut and go, but a clear strategy to improve situations in the supply chain, the situation of workers' rights, environmental standards. And that is what we are arguing about.  We also need a stronger implementation of the Green Deal in trade policy. In other words, the question of green goods initiatives within the framework of the WTO, but also bilaterally. We need a sensible border-balancing system.  Fourthly, we also need a focus on improving the implementation and implementation of trade agreements. I think we have to defend ourselves here when there are elements that attack us, when there are coercive measures by third countries. That is why we hope that next year we will also have a sensible instrument. However, we must also establish clear enforcement of the agreements.  Since 2013 we have an agreement with Central America. In Guatemala, workers' rights are still not being implemented and human rights violations continue. We have had an agreement with Korea for five years in the negotiation of the enforcement of workers' rights. Something needs to be done here, so it is right and proper to put implementation and enforcement forward. Finally, Commissioner, we are always looking for a motto for a trade strategy.

We will consider it very carefully in our reflections on a new strategic direction for trade policy.  Let me start with recalling the objectives of the trade policy review.  European trade policy is operating in an increasingly difficult environment, marked by growing tensions among major global economies, the rise of unilateralism and economic nationalism, the weaponisation of trade policy for other objectives and a weakening of the rules-based multilateral order. In addition, there are growing and legitimate expectations that trade policy must contribute to the political goals of this Commission, in particular the green and digital transitions. Finally, the COVID-19 crisis is having a devastating impact on our economies and societies, and all EU policies must contribute to sustainable recovery, including trade. The trade policy review will build a new consensus around a fresh medium-term direction for EU trade policy, responding to these global challenges and taking into account the lessons learned from COVID-19. As part of this exercise we launched a broad public consultation which ended earlier this month. We received more than 400 strong contributions from our key stakeholders, addressing all the themes included in Parliament’s resolution.  These included: the need to create more sustainable and resilient value chains; the need to sustain rules-based trade and reform of the rules-based multilateral order; the need for trade policy to contribute to the digital and green transitions, through better integration of our internal and external policies; the need to strengthen the EU’s regulatory impact and to maximise the contribution to the economic recovery, especially for SMEs; and also, the need to manage and develop our key global trade relationships; and the need to further strengthen the implementation and enforcement aspect of our trade agreements, including on sustainable development commitments. All these themes, and many others, will be developed in the communication we plan to adopt in the first quarter of 2021. This communication will outline the direction of EU trade policy for the coming years. The guiding concept is open strategic autonomy: a unique European approach to ensure that we remain open for business and trade, while at the same time becoming more assertive in defending and enforcing our interests, rights and values. This will include a limited number of concrete policy initiatives to translate the direction of trade policy into practice. Of course, this Parliament will be closely involved at all stages of this process. We will work together to ensure the highest levels of transparency and communication with stakeholders and the public. We will publish up-to-date information in easy-to-understand language and engage actively with civil society organisations, business and labour associations and citizens both directly and via social media tools.

The latest forecast from the WTO now speaks of 9.2% drop in volume of world merchandise trade for this year. But at the same time, the extreme resilience of trade links has surprised everyone, with a forecasted rebound of 7.2% in 2021. Surely now is not the time for business as usual, and my Group welcomes the Commission’s frontloading of the trade policy review in the wake of the pandemic. For us open strategic autonomy must mean a trade policy, firstly, that doesn’t try to repair what isn’t broken. Our new strategy should not make us retreat behind walls of protectionism or paint pictures of glorious self-sufficiency. Decisions on supply chains must always remain in the hands of economic operators. Secondly, it should address the structural weaknesses that were laid bare by the pandemic, such as the lack of diversification in the supply chains, for example when it comes to personal protective equipment during the first wave of the health crisis, and this has as well being highlighted by our chairman, Bernd Lange. Therefore, I call for a strategic diversification fund to be set up to help our companies to be less dependent on one single supplier. Furthermore, the conditions for trade to serve as catalyst for the recovery, must be created, for example by continuing to expand our network of FTAs to help to diversify supply chains but as well export destinations. We also need a strong focus on SMEs. They were the first hit by liquidity crunch under pandemic and they will be key to recovery and jobs, for example by initiatives such as the Access2Markets tool that has as well being asked by the Parliament. Finally, consistency and coherence in all policies and on all levels, hence the new proposals such as the China Task Force, that will help us sing from the same hymn sheet in our relations with China at all levels.

The COVID pandemic most probably shall focus on a serious economic and social crisis, maybe the most severe one of this generation. Trade can, and should, play a vital role in the recovery but, at the same time, it needs to be reshaped fundamentally to address the challenges of today and those of the future. A deep and forward-looking reform is necessary. Let me set out the priorities of my political group. Let me start first with the connection between domestic policy and trade policy, which has been referred to by you, Commissioner, and by our Chair. We need it to be both consistent and ambitious. The Green Deal needs to be integral, integrated in trade policy, but also in trade deals. We cannot set high standards for our own production and, at the same time, import products that are produced in an unsustainable manner, ignoring the Paris Agreement, or that contribute to deforestation.  Second, very important for our political group and something that we’ve urged for over many years, the enforceability of the TSD chapter. It needs to be strengthened. We need to move forward on the enforceability of labour rights and environmental standards, and that includes sanctions: no enforceability without clear sanctions.  On the US, let’s start to work with the new Biden administration to tackle the strategic challenges and build a positive agenda on trade. Rejoining the Paris Agreement is absolutely the first step in strengthening multilateralism.  When it comes to China, we do support the negotiations on the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment but, at the same time, let us be extremely clear. Full respect for human rights is needed and products produced in forced labour camps should be banned from EU markets. We call on the Commission to start preparing the negotiations with Taiwan.  The last, but not the least, point is that we urge the Commission to include a chapter dedicated to gender in all free trade agreements. Let me conclude. Commissioner, we count on you to take this Trade Policy Review seriously and to reform EU trade policy so thoroughly that we can see that the Green Deal is an integral part of it.

Over the last five years we have seen the stable and predictable environment necessary for international trade to flourish continuously undermined. The pandemic has highlighted our vulnerabilities and as we search for ways to recover from the economic shock, resilience should be at the core of the next stage of development of EU trade policy. In the current political context it would be easy to lean towards protectionism and indeed we have seen this deeply concerning trend reflected in the debate around trade lately. The phrase open strategic autonomy allows us to balance on the one hand our support for an open global trading economy, while on the other hand charting our own European strategic path. I would like to underline that my political group remains firmly committed to open and rules-based trade. We cannot and should not separate open from strategic autonomy.  My second point is about SMEs. Global markets are a crucial source of growth for SMEs. However, they often struggle to access the benefits of preferential trade agreements. There is huge untapped potential there, and one of the priorities of our new trade policy should be to address this. In particular we should focus on specific digital trade provisions in future trade agreements to benefit SMEs and services trade generally. Finally, Mr President, our trade policy has the potential to contribute significantly to the advancement of our strategic objectives around the green transition and indeed the digital transition. However, is not enough for us to quietly mainstream these objectives, our trade policy should not just contribute to their advancement, but also be seen to contribute to their advancement.

Mr President, you know that we Greens are uncompromising when it comes to defining the issues of European trade policy and for good reason, with agricultural policy, trade policy is probably the area where frictions with the European Green Pact are most important and where the prevailing mindset remains that of the 20th century, when the sustainable development objectives, but also the Paris climate agreement did not exist. In recent years, the leitmotif seems to have been more \"everything but China\" and this has made us lose sight of the major societal issues. It is therefore time for European trade policy to take a decisive turn. This is what the European Parliament is asking for: that trade policy contribute to the ecological and just transition. We therefore support this text, which is certainly perfectable, but the result of a compromise, and I thank my colleagues for their openness in putting the European Parliament on the path of ambition and feeding the European Commission in defining its Union trade strategy for the next five years. What are we asking for? First, to ensure that all free trade agreements are compatible with the Green Pact, including reviewing existing agreements that are currently under way and already negotiated. Second, to ensure that sustainable development provisions are binding and that their non-compliance by a partner is subject to sanctions. Then, to adopt a binding legislative framework on corporate due diligence throughout the supply chain for EU and foreign companies that are active in the single market. Also, to prohibit market access to products from forced labour and child labour. This would be a strong signal sent by the European Union as part of the International Year on the Eradication of Child Labour in 2021.

Finally, Commissioner, involving civil society in the implementation of free trade agreements is essential to ensure compliance with these provisions. This is the role of the Domestic Advisery Groups, whose recommendations seem to be often ignored by the European Commission.

I am in favour of strategic autonomy, but it must be an open strategic autonomy, with more free trade agreements, with the Union as an actor in the world – a global actor – with investment agreements, of course with enforcing a level playing field and setting conditions. Finally, Mr Vice-President, I would like to draw your attention to a creeping protectionism within the internal market. You don't have to close your borders to stop goods.

Our trade policy must be geared towards preserving, enabling and improving lives, but not just European lives at the expense of others. A third of the world's population still lives in great poverty and daily hunger, while a small part of humanity is better off, and better and better. Trade policy, I would like to emphasise, has a great deal to do with our production and our consumption. And that is why the Green Deal must not be a green coat of old logic and economic dogma. We must now initiate ecological and social transformation. This requires a paradigm shift, especially in the trading strategy. The success of this Commission will no longer be measured by growth in the EU. All UN countries committed to achieving the 17 SDGs by 2030.

In order for our companies to be competitive in global markets, they also need cheap supplier products. So here too we need market access, not only in order to sell our things, but we must also be able to buy the subcontractors freely if possible. Thirdly, in recent years, the world's open markets have created a huge range of products, with a huge choice, also for our consumers, and I think that very few of us today are aware of the lack of supply in our stores if global trade did not exist. However, as many previous speakers have already mentioned, global trade also needs a clear framework. To this end, we need political, legally binding rules on the rules under which trade takes place. But it is very important to me that we still rely on openness. For example, when we talk about strategic autonomy, or when we talk about new rules, such as border adjustment and other rules, we must always be clear: we do this to set rules, but we do not do this in order to close our markets off, to make life difficult for businesses, for consumers, but because we are convinced that open markets need rules. , we as a policy also want to shape the market. And it is very, very important to me that when we talk about strategic autonomy, we are talking about open strategic autonomy. We should always be aware that strategic autonomy has limits. When I read that the world's largest manufacturer of surgical gloves now has to close many of its factories, we can say again: let us produce these things in Europe!

Three key words for our trade policy. The first is efficiency. To defend our interests, Europe must make reciprocity our compass, use its defence instruments and be a leader in multilateral negotiations. The second is credibility. Europe needs to strengthen its legal arsenal in order to play on equal terms with states that care little about the rules. The regulation for the application and compliance of the rules of international trade is a first step. The new instrument to counter coercive measures is needed more than ever. Finally, the third is ambition. The fight against unfair, social, fiscal or environmental competition must be our priority. Those who want access to our market must respect our rules and standards, it is a matter of fairness and consumer protection. We know the criticisms about the binding nature of the chapter on sustainable development, our agreements certainly concern a reference to the Paris Agreements, but we must rethink in line with the Franco-Dutch initiative, the respect by our partners of our commitments.

We need a climate supremacy clause, rules to phase out fossil fuels subsidies and clear CO2 reduction commitments.  The EU is proud of its sustainability chapters.

Last week a mega-trade agreement was signed between the ASEAN countries, China, but also Australia and New Zealand. So many countries with which we already have agreements, or with which we are negotiating. The logic would be to interrupt the negotiations and look at the consequences for us in practice. I am thinking in particular of the question of rules of origin, which have been very simplified within the framework of the comprehensive regional economic partnership.

Developments in the world give every reason to be concerned both for our health and for the economy.

We must certainly not stop trading with each other or close ourselves to the outside world. On the contrary , we must – and this is perhaps my main message – we must, on the contrary, stand up for free trade, because it creates prosperity, it takes people out of poverty, it enables businesses to grow and it creates jobs. It is also one of the solutions to the climate challenge and can make it easier to get vaccines and medicines to people. There are four areas that I want to highlight specifically, which give us an opportunity right now, a time window. The first is to improve relations with the Us, the new US, administration. The mini-agreement, which I hope we approve later this week, is an opportunity to de-escalate the conflict with the United States. We should hook up with the Americans and take on China with them, because they are playing dirty games on the international market. Secondly, we need to reach an agreement with the UK very soon so that we mitigate the situation and the blow to businesses after Brexit. The third is that it is gratifying that there is now an appetite for large free trade agreements. We see this as the countries of Asia and Oceania have now concluded a major free trade agreement. The EU should go further here and continue to negotiate with several countries and, of course, ratify the Mercosur Agreement. Finally, we see new leadership in the World Trade Organisation.

It sounds great, but the truth is that so far the signals transmitted by this Commission are on the opposite line. I'll explain. This was the Geopolitical Commission, as President Von der Leyen said, but so far the only initiative she has put forward has been to hath paralyzed the largest trade and political partnership agreement signed by the European Union, which is the European Union-Mercosur agreement. This is based on previous doubts about the implementation of some of the agreements agreed. Not bad.

The European Union Foreign Ministers are following the situation closely, and the United Nations Security Council has held a closed hearing to the same effect last month. We are all deeply concerned about developments on the ground.  On 13 October, I issued a declaration on behalf of the European Union on a call for the immediate reversal of recent actions and respect for the relevant United Nations Security Council resolutions. Like the United Nations, the European Union holds Turkey responsible for the situation on the ground. These recent events around Varosha - when I was young it was called Famagusta - including President Erdogan’s visit and his statements, come at a time when attempts are underway to create a space for dialogue on Cyprus settlement issues and on the wider Eastern Mediterranean. We are passing this message clearly to our Turkish interlocutors. I have also passed it personally to the new Turkish-Cypriot leader in a telephone call I had with him immediately after his election.  This is the time to support United Nations Secretary-General Guterres in his efforts to resume the Cyprus settlement talks. Spreading distrust and more contentions will help no one. On the other hand, the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Cyprus must be given full freedom of movement in Varosha to monitor the situation in accordance with its mandate.  Mr President, honourable Members, you can be sure that European Union institutions are fully committed to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem and to the reunification based on a bi-zonal, bi-communal federation with political equality, within the United Nations framework and in line with the principles on which the European Union is founded.

With the opening of Varosha, relations between Turkey and the EU are reaching a watershed moment. Incident after incident, step by step, the Turkish President continuously moves away from European values and standards. EU—Turkey relations are at a historic low point.  This unilateral and illegal move not only inflames EU—Turkey relations, but it also negatively affects the lives of the Cypriot population. It fuels the tensions and division embedded in the society of the Cypriot island. This violation of the UN Security Council resolutions will never contribute to a comprehensive solution. It only serves the internal politics of the Turkish President at the cost of the Cypriot people. A two—state solution will never solve the conflict.  The opening of Varosha is not just a standalone incident. Two months ago, this European Parliament condemned Turkey’s illegal activities in the continental shelf of Greece and Cyprus. Earlier, we condemned the Turkish military operation in North—East Syria. Recently, we witnessed how the Turkish President used the murder of Samuel Paty in France for his own political goals. The list of incidents is long, and it seems that it has not yet come to an end. Two days ago, there was the Irini mission and a German ship that was prevented from searching the ship. I think we need a stronger mandate for Irini. Perhaps you could work on that. A clear signal from the EU is needed.

True leaders would unite, not separate, both at home and in the neighbourhood. True leaders would engage instead of invading; they would rule by law instead of oppression; they would release from jail people who stand for the political diversity of their country, for the intellectual wealth of their country.

The island was divided already before the Turkish invasion in 1973. What is new now is that Turkey seems to have given up on a negotiated solution.

We saw and noted the brave protests from Turkish-Cypriots against Erdogan’s visit to Cyprus. And we know very many Cypriots on both sides want a solution.  I really hope that the UN-led negotiations can be restarted and finally, after decades of talks, be guided to a successful conclusion.  Mr Borrell, we must be honest, it is shameful that we still have a divided country in Europe. The benefits in economic and political terms of a negotiated solution will benefit all Cypriots alike, on both sides.

Whether in Syria, Libya or Nagorno-Karabakh, Erdogan is increasingly intervening in other states in violation of international law. It provokes clashes with Greece and Cyprus in the fight for gas and oil and puts pressure on the EU with waves of refugees. He has been very active in Europe for many years, financing the construction of mosques in which he indoctrinates the Muslim youth, raises them against the West and its values, and thus establishes his fifth column. The EU's response to this provocation? As always weak and helpless. This is already shown by the title of today's item on the agenda: the much-needed resumption of talks. Have we learned nothing from history? That an appeasement policy will not succeed with megalomaniacal dictators? Should we seriously reunite here every few months to talk again about provocations and wars, to lament About Erdogan, and then urgently seek to talk to him again? Erdogan understands only one language: hardness.

They are, in my view, another destabilising Turkish action after illegal drilling in Greek and Cypriot waters, the bilateral agreement with Libya and the escalation in Nagorno-Karabakh and Syria.  High Representative Josep Borrell continues to deem our support in seeking de-escalation in the region. A solution to all contentious issues can only be achieved through dialogue between all parties and on the basis of international law.

There can be no neutral mediation. There may be a dialogue, but neutral mediation cannot take place with such a provocateur vis-à-vis the European Union. Of course, Turkey is and will remain a great country and a great neighbour with its own interests, which do not always coincide with ours. We have other problematic neighbours who have a lot to do with Turkey, too. But diplomacy must help find reasonable compromises. Where is the will for reasonable compromise in Ankara? There is only a repetition of aggressive provocations. We must also be clear-headed that today Erdogan's claims go far beyond traditional nationalist postures. There is also a strong ideological dimension in this constant agitation, an Islamist inspiration that we cannot ignore.

On behalf of the European Union I have welcomed these announcements, for three reasons. First, because we believe that these agreements help to establish new formal relations between countries that have decided to put their differences aside and to engage in a peaceful, bilateral cooperation. Secondly, we welcome these agreements because they can potentially enhance relations in areas such as technology, tourism, energy, trade, health, for regional cooperation. And third, because we believe that they could have a positive effect on other countries as well as more broadly on regional stability, which the European Union has consistently tried to promote. However, although these agreements bring positive developments, it’s clear that they all focus on the broader regional picture. Israel did commit in the context of the normalisation deal with the UAE to suspend its plans for annexation of occupied territory in the West Bank. This was a positive step and we celebrate it and we welcome it, but the agreements themselves do not address the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and the Israelis’ annexation plans still need to be abandoned, not suspended temporarily. Abandoned, abandoned altogether. We have always said there will not be sustainable peace and stability in the region without a comprehensive settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict and in particular the Israel-Palestinian conflict on the basis of a negotiated and viable two-state solution, built upon the internationally agreed-parameters. In this light, we should explore ways to apply the logic inherent to the normalisation process to generate a direct and positive impact on the situation on the ground and to create the conditions for a meaningful political process between Israel and the Palestinians. In the last weeks we had informal exchange between the Palestinian Foreign Minister Mr al-Malki and the European Union Foreign Ministers by video conference. I stressed the importance of re-engaging in a meaningful political dialogue. I also emphasised this to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Gabi Ashkenazi, when we spoke by telephone yesterday. Last week we saw the positive news that the Palestinian Authority will resume economic and security cooperation with Israel. We had actively encouraged this as the European Union, but at the same time the situation on the ground remains very worrying, notably due to continued advancements of illegal settlement construction and a significant spike in demolitions. The recent decision by Israel to open tenders to build a new settlement in Givat HaMatos, the first new settlement in occupied East Jerusalem in 20 years, is of huge concern, and yesterday in my phone conference with Minister Ashkenazi I expressed this concern and our condemnation of this initiative. We must work urgently to find a way to rebuild trust and confidence between the two parties. We must avoid unilateral actions that undermine peace efforts. The launch of negotiations remains essential. We will therefore continue to work with members of the international community, including, I hope, with a new administration in Washington, to uphold international law, to end the conflict and to ensure equal rights for all. Only by working together will we be able to end the current dynamics of perpetual confrontation and mistrust.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 173, "date": "2020-11-24.json", "name": "Antonio LÓPEZ-ISTÚRIZ WHITE", "mepid": "28399", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Mr Borrell, I am very grateful for your initial words of support for these agreements.

That is why my group wanted us to talk about these agreements, because of the lack, really, in some European institutions, and especially in some political groups, of emotion about this issue. As we speak, thousands of Israeli and Emirati workers and entrepreneurs are flying and working, helping to bring greater economic prosperity, job creation, to creating security. Why can't we join this? Let us do so in a positive way, without obviating the themes that have been proposed; nobody does. I also welcome the sit-down of Palestinians and Israelis again, that Israel is talking to Lebanon again, after decades, about territorial disputes.

But we need to support every agreement that is a step forward towards sustainable stability in the region as a whole.  We also take note that the Abraham Accords have been accompanied by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s commitment to suspend the planned unilateral annexation by Israel of occupied Palestinian territories in the West Bank against international law. However, we call again for these plans to be cancelled once and for all. Key objectives remain to put an end to the occupation of Palestine and achieve lasting peace between Israel and its Arab neighbours.  On a more general note, we must place the Abraham Accords into the broader context of geopolitical dynamics in the Middle East, in particular with regard to Iran, Saudi Arabia and Turkey. This is where the European Union should also use the momentum and take a more prominent role as a global leader in promoting peace and security, especially given the political change on the other side of the Atlantic.  Having said that, this might be one of the rare dynamics that should not be reversed from the Trump era’s legacy indeed but which should be managed in a different, responsible way with regard to both their geopolitical implications and their impact on Palestinians.

Land for Peace became Peace for Peace, but between countries who actually didn’t have conflict. Don’t get me wrong: in a region beset with conflicts, dialogues and closer ties should be welcomed. I always favour dialogue over silence. Yet we should not ignore the circumstance in which these deals were agreed. De facto annexation by Israel continues, not to speak about the demolition of Palestinian structures, including EU-funded structures. The Abraham Accords may affect the chances of reaching a two-state solution if they legitimise and consolidate the status quo, while the status quo we all agree on is not the solution to the conflict. That, colleagues, that is what worries me. Dear High Representative, the two-state solution is close to being dead and buried. It’s time to do more than declaring we remain firmly committed to it.

Any move that can reduce tensions in the Middle East is to be welcomed. Many Arab countries find it extremely difficult to reach any understanding with Israel, as the Palestinian issue is always at the heart of the debate. However, the agreement shows that relations can also be placed on a constructive level, provided that the political will is there.  I, too, am convinced that a general fatigue has set in, given the uncompromising attitude of the Palestinian leadership. Moreover, some Arab countries have recognized that Palestine cannot forever remain the focus of alignment of their relations with Israel. Having said that, the agreement also seems to me to be clear proof of a well-known proverb: \"The enemy of my enemy is my friend.\" If we accept this premise that Iran is a crucial power in the region, an alliance between Israel and the Gulf states and Sudan seems politically sensible. The United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia are engaged in a proxy war against Iran in Yemen. They also share with Israel the widespread skepticism – except in Europe – about the nuclear agreement signed with Tehran. That is why the Abraham agreements are an advantage for the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, and indirectly for Saudi Arabia – they bring more security.

Yesterday, Benjamin Netanyahu – though not officially confirmed – visited Saudi Arabia. In a region that has been suffering from conflict and confrontation for decades, such a dialogue between former antagonists is a good sign, and yes, this region really needs such good signs.  Therefore, one could actually wholeheartedly welcome the Abraham Accords if – and that’s the thing – they would live up to their stated goal to build peace. But – and that is also true, Mr White – recent developments are worrisome. The UAE has advanced a major arms deal with the USA as part of the bargain, as if we needed more weapons in the Middle East. Israel has stepped up its settlement policy against Palestinians and the human rights violations in Bahrain continue rather unnoticed. So a deal that only serves to build alliances against other neighbours or to arm the region even further is neither going to build peace, nor should it be supported by the European Union. But, on the other hand, every step that the UAE, Israel, Bahrain and hopefully many, many others take towards de-escalation and peace should have our full support.  So, very much in line with what you said, Mr Borrell, I think it’s time for a reality check.

In this I have to give the reason to Mr López-Istúriz. We don't celebrate this. If the signatory parties to these agreements stand out for anything, it is because of their contempt for human rights and a bellicose policy, which is resulting in an escalation of the arms trade. We are talking about countries that bomb Yemen or Libya and that are fully responsible for the destruction of the Palestinian people and the war in the region.  Curious peace agreements that are sold to us as an improvement for the Palestinian people, as a brake on Trump and Netanyahu's decision to annex an important part of the West Bank to Israel, but the reality is another. Palestinian society, which has not been consulted but is affected, has opposed agreements that bury any aspiration of a state of its own and, therefore, the burial of the two-state solution.

I believe, however, that two points need to be added: the first is that these agreements must in no way make us lose sight of the Palestinian question, the enormous difficulty in which Palestinian refugees find themselves today and the need not to take second place to the solution of the two peoples-two states and the full recognition of a state in Palestine. The second consideration is that the peace agreements and processes are positive if they do not turn into alliances against them and the European Union cannot simply look at what is happening in the Middle East.

You know, this complex reality can be perceived in different approaches, but for the European Union, the normalisation of relations between Israel and the countries of the region is, all in all, a welcome development which represents a positive hope for the future. But as I said, and I repeat at the same time, a just and lasting peace in the Middle East will require also progress in relation to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and there, further actions will be involved. Our role is to continue reaching out to the parties in the region. Yesterday in my conversation with Minister Ashkenazi, when the Foreign Affairs Minister of the Palestinian Authority came to the Foreign Affairs Council, we encouraged both to re-engage and have also signalled our willingness to move ahead in our bilateral relations with both. We continue thinking that a two-state solution is the only viable – difficult, but the only viable – solution, and a lot of work is still required in order to bring, at the same time, security to Israel, freedom to the Palestinians, and peace and stability to the region as a whole. These deals and the normalisation of their relations have to be considered in the complex reality of the zone. Well, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain have never been, technically, at war with Israel, so to call that a peace agreement without having had a war may be an exaggeration. But as I said, in any case it’s a positive approach that reflects a somewhat transactional rather than transformative approach, and it has to be understood in the context of the growing strategic rivalry between the Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and the wider tension in the Eastern Mediterranean, and maybe this strategy will reflect a deeper polarisation in the Arab world, where mostly Sunni Arab states consider Iran, along with political Islam, as the more serious threats in the region and are thus likely to engage in a deeper cooperation with Israel. In this context, a new regional paradigm has been emerging, where a peace deal is no longer a precondition to normalisation, and both the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and the Emirates have developed a narrative which describes normalisation as a driver in the Israeli-Arab confidence-building process, creating a more conducive environment for a two-state solution. On the other hand, it is clear that this normalisation comes after other strategic considerations, such as gaining military (F-35 fighters for the Emirates) or economic advantages, economic deals with the Emirates and Bahrain, or for Sudan, a major gain to get out of its international isolation by being taken off the list of state sponsors of terrorism, which is a major win for Sudan. Its economy is on the verge of collapse and badly needs outside investment. All these things, for sure, have been taken into consideration in these kinds of agreements. About the demolition by Israel of Palestinian structures: yesterday I had the opportunity, as I said, to talk about it with the Foreign Affairs Minister of Israel. For sure I didn’t convince him, and he didn’t convince me with their arguments and reasons, but we have reiterated that we consider these activities illegal from the point of view of international law. We reiterated our call on Israel to halt such demolitions. This confirms a regrettable trend of confiscation and demolition since the beginning of the year, which constitutes, for sure, an impediment towards the two-state solution but also to the improvement of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Israel. I am working on the prospects of holding again meetings of the Association Council that has not met in the last eight years, but for many Member States, these kinds of activities – demolitions, settlements – are strong impediments to this meeting taking place.

Je voudrais intervenir en lieu et place du haut représentant Josep Borrell, bien entendu, en plein accord avec lui sur ce que je vais vous dire. As the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists reminded, in some countries the already difficult situation for journalists is being exacerbated by the use of the pandemic as a pretext for additional restrictions on media freedom. Journalists play a fundamental role in the functioning of democracies. They help ensure accountability of those in power through the provision of timely and factual information. The Commission has said many times that democracy is fuelled by information. In other words, without information, democracy cannot work. Unfortunately, across the world journalists face intimidation, violence or abuse, often putting their lives at risk. Disturbingly, impunity for abuses and crimes against journalists and media workers remains widespread, reaching 90% of cases in some countries, according to a UNESCO report in 2019. We follow with concern reports of journalists being placed in detention without trial, the closure of media stations, and internet shutdowns in many countries. In this troubling context, the EU has stepped up its action. In all relations with other countries we have always been clear on the key role of unrestricted media and civil society and the need to protect human rights defenders, many of whom are journalists. Our EU delegations around the world have strengthened their response to attacks against journalists. A handbook on journalists’ safety has been distributed to all delegations. The delegations are producing or coordinating public statements and social media interventions to give visibility to EU support, observing court cases, identifying cases requiring special protection. In the last 12 months the EU has supported over 425 journalists with emergency grants, temporary relocation or support to their respective media outlets. Dedicated programmes have been operating in many regions for some time, with a total amount of support beyond EUR 180 million. One example is the programme Save Journalists, run by Western Balkan journalist associations. Recent programmes include COVID-19 response in Africa to gather available information, which brings together organisations such as Deutsche Welle Akademie and Reporters sans frontières to build resilience of journalists in Africa. Similar programmes are being finalised for Asia and Latin America. The safety of journalists is at the centre of EU advocacy for media freedom in intellectual fora and bilateral dialogues. We keep recalling the obligation to protect and promote freedom of opinion and expression and offering collaboration. We also work with the Council of Europe, OSCE and UNESCO, and we want to intensify this cooperation. In a similar plenary decision last year some priority areas were mentioned, on which we are making progress. As regards media freedom monitoring, the EU supports the projects of the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom and of the European Centre for Press and Media Freedom, including its rapid response mechanism. As regards opposition to strategic lawsuits against public participation (the so-called SLAPPs), EU services are formulating a common approach. The next steps are to establish, first, a network of lawyers and media specialists to exchange practices and know-how regarding SLAPP cases, and second, a focus group on legal and financial aid to identify legal and practical solutions. On a more systematic fight against impunity, apart from the already-mentioned support, protection of media independence and journalist in the Member States was a key factor in the analysis that we did in the first annual rule of law report, which is at the centre of a new rule of law mechanism. Support to the reform of justice systems and the rule of law remains key in our external cooperation in over 70 countries, with more than 2.76 billion spent between 2007 and 2017 – in 10 years. In the future we will keep on working on ending impunity for crimes against journalists with two important tools: the EU action plan on human rights and democracy for the period 2020-2024, and the forthcoming European democracy action plan. As you can see, this topic is paramount to our work on the protection and promotion of human rights, and as the examples I mentioned clearly show, we totally agree, and join forces, with your Parliament on such an issue. And I want to add that, of course, it is very important – I have said about the rule of law annual report – to do the job at home to be able to organise our action outside of the European Union.

Madam President, in a world where the truth of the facts seems to be losing its importance, it is imperative to affirm the necessity of it. To protect journalists is to affirm this need, to protect the truth. In a world where information and misinformation circulate with the same intensity, investigative journalists support democracy. They denounce corruption and embezzlement and they are an invaluable support for peoples kept in the dark by authoritarian regimes. For their acts of denunciation, they are threatened and put in danger. Reporters Without Borders reports that more than 250 journalists are in detention and 40 journalists have been murdered in 2020. This is unacceptable. In addition, this new form of violence against journalists must be recognized: the use of strategic legal action that drives journalists and the media into bankruptcy. Our duty is to defend freedom of expression, freedom of the media and journalists. The perpetrators of crimes against journalists must be sought, convicted and punished. Impunity is not acceptable. The powerful officials of this world, guilty of crimes against journalists, cannot continue to enjoy all the privileges they have arrogated themselves and, moreover, clothe themselves in the cloak of respectability. They cannot be allowed to roam freely in our countries and take advantage of poorly stocked bank accounts.

Elyas Dayee, Virgilio Maganes and Israel Rangel are the latest casualties recorded in the UNESCO Observatory's long list of murdered journalists, which tells us that, in the last decade alone, nearly 1,000 journalists have been murdered in the line of duty. In addition to these, many others have been victims of threats, intimidation, smear campaigns, arbitrary detention and torture.  The Council of Europe Platform for the Protection of Journalism and The Security of Journalists in 2020 has issued more than 180 alerts in 31 countries.  If these numbers are high, impunity even greater. Only one in 10 perpetrators of this type of crime is brought to justice.  These data leave us a clear message: freedom of the press requires permanent construction and vigilance in the protection of those who fight for it and in the punishment of those who wish to destroy it. Declarations of repudiation and the constant affirmation of the defence of democracy, the rule of law and human rights are important, but they are not enough for those who are dismayed for justice.

Madam President, on 2 November 2013, Ghislaine Dupont and Claude Verlon, two French journalists reporting in northern Mali, were abducted and murdered by jihadists. Seven years later, neither the killers nor those responsible have been brought to justice. On October 16, 2017, Daphne Caruana Galizia, a Maltese blogger, was the victim of a bomb attack while investigating corruption. The trial of his alleged sponsor has not yet taken place. On 25 February 2018, the Slovak journalist, Jen Kuciak, was shot dead along with his partner while investigating possible embezzlement of European funds by the mafia. Although the two shooters were convicted by the Slovak justice system, no client is now behind bars. It would take me much more than two minutes to name the 800 journalists killed in the last 10 years for simply trying to inform the public and get the truth out.

As we can see in the case of the murder of Ján Kuciak, it is really important to investigate not only their executors, but also the orderers and the link to state power in the case of crimes. The work of journalists is in many ways a mirror of the political regimes in which these journalists work. Journalists do not do their job in a spirited way, the whole media must be free.

The same data shows that in nine out of ten cases, killers go unpunished.  Impunity encourages perpetrators, which in an atmosphere of fear and unprotectedness, leads to a loss of courage and motivation of journalists and the importance of journalistic calling in our communities. Journalists in some parts of the world are on the last line of defence of democracy. That is why we need to put special emphasis on the education and training of young journalists, as well as on improving media literacy. Fifty-seven journalists were killed worldwide last year according to United Nations figures. Although these brutal statistics are changing and the curve is taking a downward trajectory, in the first nine months of this year three female journalists and 39 journalists were killed. This is the lowest death toll in a decade. Public debates have certainly contributed to this, focusing high on this topic as an insistence on security mechanisms to protect journalists. But we still have to ask oursself questions, what is the price for a written or spoken word, what are the justice and security systems in countries where such violence is present.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you first of all for this debate again held in plenary on a subject of fundamental importance. And I think it is very useful that many of you have recalled the long list of journalists who have been victims of violence and attacks in recent years, in recent months, in recent weeks, including in the European Union. Protecting journalists is a long-term task that requires clear objectives and coordinated action. I mentioned two instruments that will now guard our efforts: the new EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy for 2024, which sets out clear guidelines for a coordinated and effective approach, and the upcoming European Democracy Action Plan, of which media pluralism and freedom are one of the looters. I also want to add that the EU sanctions regime remains a key political priority. As you know, the new regime will not replace existing geographic sanctions regimes, some of which already address human rights violations and abuses, for example in Syria, Belarus or Venezuela. The new global sanctions regime will provide the EU with greater flexibility to target those responsible for serious human rights violations and abuses worldwide, no matter where they occur or who is responsible - and, of course, who are the victims, including journalists. I am pleased that good progress has been made in the discussions on the proposals at the technical level in the Council, and let me recognize the long—standing support of the European Parliament for such a regime. Everyone involved continuing working towards its adoption in the near future, and hopefully before the end of this year. The European Parliament's contribution is crucial if we are to achieve our common objectives. I would also like to add that, as I said earlier, if we are working to protect journalists through all international contacts, we must also do this work within the European Union. And, I recall, the first report we published on 30 September on the rule of law in the 27 Member States of the Union has four chapters. One of these chapters concerns the freedom and pluralism of the media, with particular attention paid to the attacks on journalists in recent months, but also to the measures that have sometimes been taken in the Member States during the emergency period linked to the health crisis we are experiencing. I would also like to add that, as Commissioner for Justice, I regularly remind Member States, as well as international partners, of the need to fight impunity when violence, abuse or attacks are committed against journalists. I would therefore like to end by thanking you for your commitment to freedom of the press, guaranteeing you the Commission's determination to continue very active work in the Union, as well as outside the Union on this subject, and to strengthen the protection implemented against journalists, whether in the Member States or in third countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 217, "date": "2020-11-24.json", "name": "Ewa KOPACZ", "mepid": "197525", "text": "  I close the debate.

Unfortunately, around the world journalists face acts of intimidation, violence or abuse, often putting their lives at risk. The safety of journalists lies at the heart of the concerns of the European Union, which continues to take all measures to protect and promote freedom of opinion and expression. We all need to understand that by supporting journalists, we are practically protecting the truth. That is why we must do much more to defend journalists and to ensure freedom and pluralism of the press in all EU Member States. Because if journalists can't do their job freely, then our democracies will cease to be democracies. Therefore, any attempt to silence critical and independent media must be condemned.

It pointed to corruption in the government, accusations of money laundering and links between the Maltese online gambling industry and organised crime. She did not give up despite threats and processes. In 2016-17, she revealed sensitive information and allegations related to a number of Maltese politicians and the Panama Papers scandal.

In different countries, the free press has been attempted to put pressure on it by justifying it by taking action against COVID-19, or without justification at all. The European Parliament is clearly of the opinion that even in these mixed times, the press has a very important role to play. Among other things, there have been cases where the government or the government community sees the public media as a voice tube. At this point, it is a good reminder that public broadcasting is not government radio or government television, but must provide access to everyone. The owners of large social media platforms also need to take a more serious look at what is being disseminated on their platforms.
