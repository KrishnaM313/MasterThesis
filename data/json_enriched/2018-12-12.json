Mr President of the European Parliament, ladies and gentlemen of the European Parliament, Allow me first to condemn in the strongest terms the terrorist attack that took place yesterday here in Strasbourg. I express my deepest sympathy and condolences to the families, and wish a speedy and full recovery to those who were injured.  Terrorism constitutes one of the more serious threats to the peace and security of our Union. We shall not allow fear and terror to prevail. Instead, we shall remain united in enhancing our efforts to eliminate this deplorable phenomenon. Mr President, it is a high honour for me to address the plenary session of the European Parliament in the presence of the Presidents of the EU political institutions and before the European citizens, and to have the opportunity to present my thoughts and ideas, but most of all, my vision for the future of the Union. I do so, ladies and gentlemen, with full conscience that I am addressing the institution and symbol, if you will, of the heart of democratic Europe, which embodies the timeless principles and values that permeate the becoming of the great common European family. As the European Parliament, you are one of the main pillars and actors in ensuring the democratic functioning of the Union, which is why your role is and will remain crucial.  Ladies and gentlemen, for Cyprus and its people, its accession to the European Union in 2004 was a seal of a European orientation but also of a millennial identity. It was strongly supported by the Cypriots not only as a source of stability and a prospect of prosperity but also as a potential catalyst in the ongoing efforts to reunite and consolidate security and peace in my country.  I would like to stress that Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, in 2004, have identical their own future to the future of Europe, in the belief that soon the same conditions of normality, peace and security prevailing in the other Member States would prevail in our country. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's Europe was founded on the horrors of two world wars as a result of collective conscience and responsibility of bold leaders who believed in cooperation and unity. Their aim was economic cooperation in principle, but in evolution the safeguarding of human rights, the rule of law, the well-being and security of citizens through economic integration and the establishment of the four basic freedoms. In order to achieve these objectives with collective, hard work and work, the Union has emerged as the most remarkable model of peace and prosperity in modern history, a model that we must preserve and strengthen, and it is really with great anxiety that we are following the latest developments and trends that tend to shake the unity that has distinguished the Union for years. Developments and trends such as the withdrawal of a Member State from the European Union, the closure of borders in violation of the Schengen Treaty, the revival of nationalist tendencies, the obsolescence of the role played by the Union through the rise of populism and, as they see fit, exacerbating the phenomenon of terrorism, such as what we unfortunately experienced yesterday, I think we should be deeply concerned about. These are phenomena that we collectively have to deal with in order to protect geographical, political and economic unity, that is, the European integration for which you have worked hard.  Ladies and gentlemen, President Juncker had presented an ambitious programme for the mandate of this Commission with a view to the next European elections, which are now approaching. Cyprus as a strong supporter of a stronger, more democratic and more united Europe has been and remains a helper in the implementation of this programme. In this context, the ongoing consultation concerns our future, the future of Europe. It is a first-class opportunity to listen to civil society so that we are better able to assess effectiveness and to redefine our policies in a targeted way, to make them more beneficial to citizens. We need to listen to the citizens in order to understand the root causes of the obsolescence expressed as an indication of the high abstention rate in the European elections and to understand the reasons for the gap and the crisis of confidence.  Ladies and gentlemen, the consultation on the future of Europe in each Member State should be based in my view on the following questions: Which Europe do we want but also what lessons are we learning from Europe's progress so far? What is it that we need to improve and how? How close are we to the citizens? What are the root causes of the growing current of nationalist and populist movements and how could this phenomenon be treated? How are growing social and economic inequalities in Europe addressed? In my view, there is now an urgent need for clear answers in the context of sincere self-criticism, reflection and ultimately reordering, so that we can understand what we have failed and what we should do better so that the citizen can re-trust the Union and its institutions. To feel safe again, convinced that all challenges are faced, to experience in his daily life the positive impact of common policies in areas such as health, the environment, working conditions, areas that affect the problems of daily life and the well-being of citizens.  Mr President, there is no way that the European Union is a mosaic of states and peoples, the beauty and value of which results from composition and diversity. Each piece has its own value, less or greater, as well as has its own peculiarities.  The mosaic remains in any case incomplete, when even the smallest part is absent from it. Therefore, power and value lie in composition and unity. This is what our cooperation is based on: unity and solidarity.   Ladies and gentlemen, in 2013, when I took over the presidency of the state, I was faced with painful dilemmas. Cyprus has faced a strong economic crisis, which, given the size and nature of its economy, has adversely affected the majority of its citizens.  By taking difficult but necessary decisions with concrete and coherent measures and supporting Cypriot society, which has experienced economic consequences comparable to those that followed the 1974 invasion, we have implemented substantial sections and reforms that have enabled our economic reconstruction sooner than even the most optimistic would expect.  An epigrammatic reference to the positive results achieved by the Cypriot economy in recent years vindicates the series of responsibility decisions we have taken as a government. Among other things, I could briefly mention the exit from the economic adjustment programme, and in a shorter period than the international community expected, continuous upgrades from the rating agencies and the reintegration of Cyprus into the investment tier, Cyprus' exit to the international markets, for the fourth consecutive year a positive growth rate of close to 4% is recorded, a continuous downward trend in unemployment recording the highest annual decrease among Member States and , for the fifth year in a row, we are now projected to have an asthmatic budget.  Ladies and gentlemen, we are committed and determined to maintain macroeconomic stability, to broaden the conditions under which the surplus and high growth rates have occurred and to give further impetus to the excellent prospects created for the main productive sectors.  It is in exactly the same spirit that we are moving forward with regard to the European Union budget, the ongoing negotiations on the new multiannual financial framework for 2021-2027, which must reflect the growth path that Europe has entered after a difficult decade as a result of the global economic crisis.  We want an ambitious budget that includes those necessary costs to address modern social challenges; challenges involving a wide range of key areas such as the transition to digital integration, promoting sustainable development, climate change, innovation, migration, the rise of extreme nationalism, asymmetric threats and the fight against terrorism. At the same time, the new multiannual financial framework must focus on people, focus on the European citizen and improve his quality of life. Through cost rationalisation and proper planning to make sure that European taxpayer's money is spent on targeted policies and is in no way wasted, it is not wasted on inefficient programmes. The new budget, now that we will be a Europe of 27, must be properly adapted but also flexible and balance between our traditional policies and modern needs. In this context, i.e. closer economic understanding, we must seek to complete the banking union project in the light of a renewed monetary and economic union and to promote the capital markets union which will mobilise capital for investment in the Member States.  Mr President, there is no doubt that the common market, which has recently reached its 25th birthday, is one of the most important achievements of the European Union. The long-term objective of defending the acquis of the common market requires all those, all the necessary measures in order to achieve adaptation to the new data, as they have been developed in the meantime, in order to fully respond to the modern needs of the digital age, to the challenges of the low energy footprint of a circular economy and above all to have a positive impact on the daily lives of its citizens. I look forward to tomorrow's debate on these issues during the work of the European Council, from which I expect a strong commitment to a strengthened common market for the future. Ladies and gentlemen, as we move from soft power to the Union's common defence armour, it is a fact that much has been achieved with the adoption of the Treaty of Lisbon. Clearly there is room for further improvements, always in a climate of consensus and respect for the particular sensitivities of each Member State. Any differentiation in the way decisions are taken in the field of defence, I believe, would be counterproductive in terms of the necessary convergences. Cyprus has been and continues to be a strong supporter of the ever-increasing defence and military cooperation between Member States. It is one of those countries which have expressed from the outlying the desire to join permanent structured cooperation, known as PESCO. Although we recognise PESCO as a decisive step, our vision remains the military self-determination of Europe. The creation of a Euro-army, a body of power that will protect the Union's borders and operate – and I would like to emphasise this – always dissuasive and defensive and not aggressively in the interests of the European Union. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would then like to refer to some external factors, but which undermine the cohesion of the European Union, factors which, in my view, must be tackled with determination in a climate of unity and solidarity. The unprecedented humanitarian crisis that we have faced in recent years primarily imposes the need to set aside different approaches and narrow nationalist priorities.  The southern neighbourhood of Europe is facing massive migratory flows and the burden is disproportionate to the Member States, especially the front line, among them I must admit our country, which has recently been under increasing excessive migratory pressure, so that it is now at the top of the host countries for political asylum seekers, always in proportion to the population of course. Additional reasons that exacerbate the problem in Cyprus are on the one hand the dividing line between free and occupied areas and on the other hand Turkey's continued refusal not only to recognise the Republic of Cyprus but also to implement the agreements it has concluded with the European Union, such as the readmission agreement. It does not even cooperate with the Cypriot authorities, because it considers, otherwise a candidate country, that the Republic of Cyprus, a Member State of the European Union, is deceased. I would say more generally with regard to the system that an immediate review of the common European asylum system and the Dublin regulations is needed for a fairer distribution of the migrant and refugee burden between the Member States, as this is now absolutely necessary. Another challenge we face, ladies and gentlemen, is that of climate change. Our commitment to the Paris Agreement and to systematic and coordinated action for a more ambitious policy at the ongoing summit in Katowice, Poland, is imperative. If we underestimate the visible risks, the consequences will unfortunately be dramatic not only for the ecosystem but also for the economy and, as you all understand, for the daily lives of our fellow citizens.  In the context of the wider regional role we are developing and the tripartite cooperation, it is our intention to take on a coordinating role at regional level to address the consequences of climate change and related synergies with countries in the region. As you are well aware, the Eastern Mediterranean region is one of those regions which has already had a profound impact on environmental change.  Mr President, the most substantial challenge in the Union's long history is the Decision of the United Kingdom to withdraw, with the result that for the first time the 27 are called upon to manage such a project. Respect for the decision of the British people was of course the only option. As the European Union we negotiated with seriousness and unity, supporting Michel Barnier's team, which prepared the web of principles that will allow the United Kingdom to leave the Union as smoothly as possible. We are – I must say – completely satisfied with the overall outcome of the negotiations. We support a broad and multi-layered relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union and in this direction we will continue to work. The new relationship must be mutually beneficial, in full harmony with the principles of the European Union, its intersection and its autonomy.  With regard to the British bases in Cyprus, we are also pleased, since we have ensured what we had set ourselves from the outset, namely the uninterrupted continuation of the implementation of the European acquis, so that all European citizens residing on the British bases benefit from the privileges of the European acquis and continue to enjoy the rights and benefits of the Union.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, as Cyprus we want through our actions to contribute to a strong and united European Union that promotes peace, stability, security, solidarity and the well-being of the peoples who make up its unique mosaic.  In this context, building on our geographical position and excellent relations with neighbouring peoples, we have developed actions and synergies in the Eastern Mediterranean area in recent years. In an unstable region we have methodically established, together with Greece, tripartite cooperation mechanisms with countries in the region such as Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine on the basis of international law and on the values of mutual respect and solidarity.  On the recommendation of the Cypriot Government, our proposal to set up a permanent tripartite secretariat based in Cyprus has been approved, in order to make the coordination between us more effective as well as the continuous monitoring and evaluation of the progress of these partnerships. The institutionalisation of tripartite cooperation is also proving to be particularly beneficial for the European Union, particularly in the energy sector, contributing to the desired energy security and diversification of the Union's energy sources and supply corridors.  It is also very important that the European Union remains clearly in solidarity with the Republic of Cyprus in the exercise of its sovereign rights to research and exploit its natural resources within the exclusive economic zone, while consistently and consistently pointing out the avoidance of any threats or destabilising actions incompatible with what international law and European law dictate. Ladies and gentlemen, in the introductory part of my address I pointed out that the Cypriots identified, at the time of Cyprus' accession to the European Union, their own future with the future of the Union and the other European citizens. They expected that integration would have a catalytic role and give them the same rights and the same level of respect for their fundamental freedoms as other European citizens enjoyed and enjoyed in their countries without dividing lines, without guaranteeing and invasive rights of third parties, in the presence of an occupying army and restrictions on basic freedoms. I often refer to my vision of a Cyprus beacon of stability in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Realistically speaking, ladies and gentlemen, we know that the light of this lighthouse will fall short of its potential maximum power as long as Cyprus remains divided.  Sometimes the current challenges, ladies and gentlemen, make us forget great historical truths, but the problem of Cyprus remains basically a problem of foreign invasion and occupation and violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms, since in 1974 more than a third of the population of Cyprus was forced to appeal to its own country. At a time when the Union is dealing with the management of new tragic wars that have resulted in millions of people being brought in, the refugees of Cyprus continue to be de-disabled of their basic freedoms, unable to enjoy their property peacefully and live in their homes, as they have every right.  While we are discussing our future, the future of Europe, for Cypriot citizens, even these four basic freedoms – self-evident for all other European citizens – are a difficult task to achieve.  The Chair and the members of the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament are fully aware of the realities and allow me here to express on behalf of all Cypriots thanks and satisfaction for the response of the committee and its action especially with regard to the enclosed city of Famagusta.  I could only agree with the conclusions of the report in particular by saying that the return of varosians to their legal inhabitants would be the ideal model of confidence-building measures, a model of coexistence and cooperation between Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. An excellent precursor – if you will – of the overall solution.  I would also remind you that in 1984 and 1992 the international community through the United Nations Security Council and Resolutions 550 and 789 called for the transfer of the administration of the region concerned, which is under Turkish occupation, to the responsibility of the United Nations. Unfortunately, this was not possible because of Ankara's attitude.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Europe, which is rightly involved in or taking initiatives to solve international problems, is of the opinion that it has a moral duty to contribute to solving a problem of a Member State. A problem that is an open wound in her own body. Healing this wound will strengthen the Union not only morally but also substantially, since only then will Cyprus be able to play its full potential in a region that is particularly important to the interests of the Union. What I want to assure the Members of the European Parliament is the will and determination to work hard to achieve a solution that does not create winners or leaves losers, a solution that fully respects the expectations and concerns of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, that creates a functioning and sustainable federal state, on the basis of UN Security Council resolutions. , from time to time agreements between the leaders of the two communities, a sovereign and independent State, free from any third-party dependencies through invasive or guarantee rights or occupation armies. A European state whose structure, institutions and functions are fully in line with European principles and values.  That is why we support in every way the efforts of the Secretary-General of the United Nations and his special envoy, in the hope that very soon those conditions will be created that will return us to the negotiating table, to the bank of an agreed framework and the conditions of reference under way with a view to a comprehensive solution and the reunification of the homeland.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it would be an incomparable omission if, on the occasion given to me today, I did not express the grateful thanks of the Cypriot people, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, to the European Parliament for their full support for our efforts to find a peaceful solution in a European state.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in conclusion I would once again like to thank you for the opportunity you have given me to develop my vision for the future of Europe, how we Cypriots view the European Union. There are many, friends and friends, challenges and justifiably high expectations of us. But there are all the necessary ingredients and guarantees, as long as we remain in solidarity and respect for the core values that the Union has long advocated. We are the continuators of the original vision of a strong and prosperous Europe, not only to preserve our precious mosaic but to highlight it further. It is for this prosperous Europe that we must join forces, leaving aside different approaches and narrow national interests, in order to effectively address the common challenges. Only in this way can we achieve a bright future for the Union and for its citizens. Thank you very much.

This we condemn with great firmness. We are grateful for the tireless work of the first responders, and we trust in the work of the law enforcement services to bring those responsible to justice. We will continue to defend our free and open societies by all means available to us. The city of Strasbourg is a symbol of European peace and democracy: values that we will always defend. The European Commission stands alongside France and the French people at this very difficult moment. Honourable Members, I wished we had a better situation to talk about the future of Europe than where we are today. Nevertheless, we cannot give up. We need to continue building a better and safer Europe for our citizens. Intolerance and hate don’t belong in our societies, and they don’t represent our values. I want to thank Mr President, my good friend Nicos, for being here today to debate the future of Europe. I remember when we talked about the future of the EU in the Prime Minister’s office in Finland many years back. We have continued this discussion during all these years, and now we are here in the European Parliament to discuss with you, honourable Members, the challenges, opportunities and direction of the European Union. Mr President, you and your country has always shown a great European solidarity. You have shown this time and again over the years. When it comes to migration, you have always been there and taken much more than your fair share of responsibility. The financial economic crisis also hit Cyprus harder than most. The effects will not go away overnight, but today I see a recovering labour market and economy – growing by over 4% in 2017 and continuing at an impressive rate this year. I see a more stable financial sector with a lower – although still too high – rate of non-performing loans. I see also investment returning thanks, in part, to the Juncker Plan, which has helped trigger EUR 109 million of additional investment. It has also supported 124 smaller companies, or start-ups, to grow and create jobs locally. I will visit Cyprus at the end of January to discuss further use of the Juncker Plan in order to help boost growth and job creation. But if the situation has turned around, it is because of the strength and hard work of the Cypriot people. I want to pay tribute to them in particular, for everything they have done. I also want to pay tribute to you, Mr President, dear Nicos, for your commitment to the programme of recovery. Tough decisions made and the commitment to making them work should never be overlooked by anyone in Europe. We know there’s still a long way to go and the Commission will assist you every step of the way, including through tailored support offered by a structural reform support service. It has already provided EUR 520 million to support the economic integration of the island and improve links and contacts between its two communities. But it also continues to support Cyprus across the board, including meeting its climate and energy costs. The point is that as we look to the future, Europe will stand in solidarity with Cyprus, just as Cyprus has always stood in solidarity with Europe. And nowhere is that more important than when it comes to bringing to an end the division of the island. The Commission will stand ready to assist any efforts. The Commission will always answer your call to support any negotiations or discussions held under the auspices of the United Nations that work towards a fair, comprehensive and viable settlement. This would be beneficial for Cyprus, for Europe and for the wider security and stability in the region. There would be no more important message for our common future. But we must prepare that future as of today. Later this week, European leaders, including the President, will have a real discussion on our future long-term budget. This is not about numbers or figures only; it is about our future. It is about deciding what Europe should achieve, and it is about deciding where to invest in our future, on the issues that matter to most to the people of Cyprus and the whole of Europe. This is why the Commission has put forward a fair, modern and balanced budget. A budget that is more efficient and more focused on the issues that matter to most – just as Cyprus has all along been calling for. For instance, there will be an almost three-fold increase in funding for migration and security, to make sure that Europe can protect its citizens. This will be especially important for Cyprus, as a country that has taken so much responsibility in this area. Funding for research and innovation will be increased by 50%. We have also proposed to double the means of Erasmus+ and a new Digital Europe programme worth EUR 9 billion will support Europe’s digital transformation. All of these will provide real opportunities for Cypriots and further boost the productivity of the Cypriot economy. We have also proposed an enhanced reform support programme with EUR 22 billion earmarked for key reforms identified in the European Semester. All of this will make a real difference on the ground in Cyprus and across our Union. So it is crucially important that we can agree on our new budget as swiftly as possible. Mr President, I count on your support, your counterparts’ support, and this House’s support, in order to make all this happen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  im Namen der PPE-Fraktion. – Meine Herren Präsidenten, sehr geehrter Präsident Anastasiades! Eine schreckliche Nacht liegt hinter uns. Ich möchte zunächst Dank sagen, Herr Präsident Tajani, bei Ihnen für die Abläufe, für das Management in dieser schwierigen Nacht für uns. Sie haben das Parlament hier stark geführt. Und ich möchte auch den Mitarbeitern ein herzliches Dankeschön sagen, weil die Versorgung im Haus sichergestellt worden ist und die Fahrer gearbeitet haben in der Nacht. Alle waren bereit, in dieser schwierigen Situation Verantwortung zu übernehmen. Und deswegen: Lassen Sie ein herzliches Dankeschön auch an die Mitarbeiter des Hauses ausrichten. (Beifall) Meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren! Der Tag erinnert uns an unsere Werte, an das friedliche Miteinander auf diesem Kontinent. In dieser Nacht und in diesen Stunden sind wir vor allem Demokraten. Europa ist für uns der Kontinent der Freiheit, den es zu verteidigen gilt. Deswegen muss angesichts der schrecklichen Vorkommnisse der letzten Stunden eines politisch klargestellt werden: dass wir uns nicht von Radikalen aufhetzen lassen, dass es nicht um die Chance geht, Hass zu säen, dass es keinen Kampf der Kulturen gibt. Es gibt keinen Kampf der Religionen, sondern was es gibt, ist ein Aufstehen der Humanität gegen verblendete Verbrecher. Wir dürfen nicht zulassen, dass Hass gesät wird. (Beifall) The best answer we can give is what our President said: to continue our work. Tonight, we learned a lot about our identity, about freedom in the European Union. When we look to Cyprus, Mr President, we can learn a lot about our identity. Seventy-two per cent of your citizens in Cyprus feel like citizens of the European Union, so they feel at home in the European Union. Sometimes we probably make the mistake that we speak too much about the few anti—Europeans in Europe and we forget about the millions and millions of Europeans who really feel like Europeans, like your citizens in Cyprus. Even in difficult times, they continue to do so. Cyprus managed to overcome the euro crisis – Jyrki Katainen was referring to this. In only three years, Cyprus has completed the adjustment programme and GDP grew almost twice as much as in the Eurozone average in the last year. Today, Cyprus enjoys the highest government surplus in the European Union – 1.8% – and in the last year, the unemployment rate decreased from 10.5% to 7.5%. Twelve thousand Cypriots have found a job during the last years, in a small country that matters a lot. So congratulations, Mr President.  (Applause) It is the achievement of your country, and it is the achievement of you as the president of this country and your idea to have stability, to have the will for reforms and also the will for investment, which is exactly what Jyrki Katainen proposed for the future for the eurozone, to have positive economic development. What I want to underline is your readiness to take over responsibility. You didn’t blame Brussels for any kind of measures; you didn’t attack Brussels for any kind of activities, like so many other leaders in the European Union are doing every day. You took over responsibility, and that’s why I want really to congratulate you for the efforts you made.  The second point I want to underline is security. Cyprus is one of our smaller countries, and in your country’s geographical situation, it is important to talk about defence. That’s why I thank you so much for your clear commitment towards a strong pillar of defence for the European Union. My group is strongly supporting the idea of a cyber-security unit, and also of a unit for drone technologies, though especially in the modern forms of defence we have strongly to work together. And on the Turkey question, we know Turkey goes in the wrong direction: away from democracy, less freedom of press, less rule of law. Turkey is distancing itself from the values of the European Union, and that’s why I think it’s time to consider a new approach on the cooperation with Turkey. Take case by case relationships to open a door for the future. On the concrete Cyprus question, it’s clear for us that the interests of Cyprus are the interests of the European Union. Mr President, please pass a message in this question of Turkey: we all are Cypriots, we are backing the position of the Cypriot President. And on the Energy Union, as a final point, I want to underline that today we, as Europeans, are depending a lot on oil and gas from foreign sources. The efforts of Cyprus to find greater supply of natural gas would not only benefit your country, but also benefit the interests of the whole European Union. That’s why we, as Europeans, do not allow any forms of threat and blackmailing from our neighbours. We must stop, on the one hand, Nord Stream 2, which would make Europe more dependant on Russian gas. And on the other hand, we will not permit Turkey to slow down the Cypriots in their search for different energy sources. Cyprus can count on Europe in this concrete question. And for the conclusions, Cyprus is a small country, but it makes a difference in Europe. Many big Member States should take Cyprus as an example for the determination and for the courage you had and you showed. The people of Cyprus have to know that Europe is your safe home and Europe will stand beside you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Victor BOŞTINARU", "mepid": "39711", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, I would like to welcome President Anastasiades to the European Parliament, and I will start by reiterating what is most important. Cyprus is an important Member State of the European Union and the future of reform in a united, prosperous Europe depends on the success of Cyprus. The stability and security of all Member States and the well-being of European citizens, including all Greek and Turkish Cypriots, are a priority and should remain a priority for us. I was very hopeful the last time we met, Mr President, believing that, at a time when Europe was facing many challenges and disappointments, Cyprus would be a success story, that the Greek and Turkish Cypriots would be the ones to overcome divisions and hate. I must admit that the failure of the talks in Crans-Montana saddened all of us. My political group, the Socialists and Democrats, remains committed to the reunification of Cyprus, as, I believe, the European Parliament does. We are committed to a stable and lasting solution, based on EU values and on all EU and relevant resolutions, but, most of all, to a solution that benefits the citizens living in Cyprus, be they Greek or Turkish, who are worried about the current deadlock in the negotiations. And we call on you, Mr President, on your vision and on your courage, to overcome the deadlock and to explore any possibility of resuming talks and ensuring clear terms of reference that will enable swift results. I think this will be a major breakthrough, and the Cypriot people deserve that. The EU is ready to back you in all of these very difficult endeavours. I can assure you of my Group’s readiness to play the most constructive possible role in the future agreement on the reunification of Cyprus. That said, I would like to share with you some concerns. First on the economic situation of your country. In spite of the clear re-launching of economic growth in Cyprus – four percentage points is quite significant in comparison to the much lower and slower economic growth in other Member States – the Commission has reported that inequality is one of the most alarming factors. Inequality is rising not only in Cyprus but at EU level too, and the austerity policies of the last decade, and the Troika policy which played a devastating role in your country, have contributed to increasing the gap. Let’s try to reverse the trend. It is timely to work on fighting this, so let’s work together, in each and every Member State and at Union level, on the social model: on a fair Union that can face the challenges of populism and nationalism. It is true that nationalism and populism are on the rise, but let us tackle the poverty and inequality that constitute fertile ground for those extreme political trends. Mr President, I have a serious concern about something which is quite alarming for both security and social reasons, namely the ‘citizenship by investment’ programme. You are providing European citizenship to nationals of third countries and, looking at the breakdown of those who benefit from this programme, I think you should work on winding it down and stopping it – and this is not to intervene in any way in your internal decisions. Mr President, as a Romanian, and knowing that Romania will soon hold the rotating Council Presidency, I’m deeply convinced that full and sincere cooperation among all Member States will provide the future EU summit in Sibiu with a good result for Europe. The future of the Union is based, as you rightly said, on unity and solidarity: a future of the Union which diminishes frustrations and divisions and ensures, for all of us, that there will be no double standards in the Union. Thank you once again for your contribution. I am absolutely convinced that Cyprus will remain one of the most active contributors to unity and to a prosperous future in our Union.

Mr President, Commissioners, Your Excellency, you are president of a small island and remote state of the European Union and you manage the only weapon at its disposal: the identity of its existence, the title of the Republic of Cyprus. I will ask my major question from the outset, which is this: What future can the European Union have if it sacrifices a Member State, leaving it to become a Turkish protectorate for the benefit of economic interests and trade under a dictatorial regime.  Colleagues, territories of the Republic of Cyprus are held militarily by Turkey, which constantly threatens it and carries heavy weaponry to the occupied areas. Mr President, you have raised all the major issues that concern our country. I will not refer to them. I will confine myself only to the Cyprus issue, because your efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue have collapsed despite the goodwill you have shown, due to the aggressive and intransigent attitude of Turkey, whose objective remains full control of the land and sea area of the Republic of Cyprus, while the solution you have sought to date has proved impractical and unworkable and impractical.  Since 2004 the Republic of Cyprus has been a Member State of the European Union, and here the following questions are being asked: Why did the Republic of Cyprus not require the European Union to implement the provisions of the Treaties, the European acquis, the principles and values of the European Union, the Charter of Human Rights, the Accession Protocol, the Additional Protocol, the counter-declaration of 21 September 2005 , the resolution on Famagusta (The Written Declaration) and many other legal declarations that would shield the Republic of Cyprus and make the solution viable, fair and functional?  Why did the Republic of Cyprus never react when Turkey, by illegally, did not sign with Cyprus the Treaties it signed with the 27 Member States? Why did he not react when Tsavousoglou submitted a document to the Commission describing Cyprus as a deceased? Why did you accept the signing and updating of the European Union-Turkey Customs Union? Why did you accept the readmission agreement? Why did you accept the refugee agreement and many other treaties signed with the 27 Member States but not with the Republic of Cyprus? All these agreements apply to the detriment of the status of the Cypriot state and peace, since Turkey is not under any pressure to resolve the Cyprus problem. On the other hand, why does the European Union accept to talk and give billions to a dictatorial state, which is a candidate for membership of the European Union, while it holds part of European territory and does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus? Why does it apply conditions that are not signed with a Member State and do not interrupt accession? Why is it imposing sanctions on Russia for the integration of Crimea and leaving Turkey undisturbed while it holds a military member state?  The European Union must demand turkey's recognition of the Republic of Cyprus and respect for the rights of our state. The European Union cannot recognise the effects of the blind war violence of 1974 and accept the dissolution of the Republic of Cyprus. The solution must be based on the principles and values of the European Union and on the full implementation and full respect of the four basic freedoms, guaranteed by the democratic principles of the European Union. The European Union cannot allow Cyprus to be transformed into a Turkish protectorate. Thank you, Mr President, and welcome to the European Parliament.

For me and the ALDE Group, there are no two communities, but a Cypriot European nation and compatriots. A single Republic of Cyprus.  But, Mr President, Cyprus has both internal and external pathology. When we talk about Cyprus has three guaranteeing countries — which are: Britain, about to leave the European Union; another outside the European Union, which is Turkey; and another that is within the European Union, which is Greece—what we see is a pathological situation that does not take place in any country in the world and is a consequence of a situation that you know, which is the horrible war of both liberation and independence and intercommunal warfare before 1960, with the situation of the EOKA and what you know. At the bloody Christmas of 1963, horrific events occurred in the two communities, and the Turkish community was removed from the institutions in 1964. The Republic of Cyprus has too many \"taksim\", it has too many \"Megali Idea\", too many ideas of \"enosis\" in the past. And it also has the story of Nikos Sampson's coup against President Makarios in 1974.  And what is a pathology, and I tell you from what I know, is that, for one part of the Cypriot community — and I am talking about the Cypriot community, a single Cyprus — there is an occupation, but for another part of that Cypriot community it is a guarantee. And that's pathological. Therefore, the first thing we have to raise is why all this exists and not simply to raise it as a question of metaphysical situation, but of real situation in the split society, divided and separate Cypriot. And this brings me to the following issues.  The first one. Nearly half a century, Mr. President, half a century, of two separate communities living back and back; they are generations that have not been known; generations who live looking the other way. This objectively means a situation of deepening social division, apart from geographical division. If we continue in the blocking situation, which is what is happening now, it will continue to delve into two social situations that will not be understood because they are not known.  The second one. And this brings me to politicians. Crans-Montana came very close to the agreement, but to what extent is there a lack of political decision? That decision made by a political leader, Winston Churchill, when he was able to take the risk of prioritizing the interests of the British nation and not the interests of its particular political interests. And in Crans-Montana, so close and so far. The next question is, therefore: when will Cypriot politicians understand that the nation is more important than its particular interests? The third concerns the objective situation. When you enter the Parliament of Cyprus, a part of Parliament is empty, it is that of your compatriots — my Fellow Turkish Cypriots Europeans - who are absent. Here, on the other hand, all the posts of the European Parliament are occupied, but they do not represent the entire Cypriot community, they represent one side, and that is also a pathological situation. And this brings me to the last question. Crans-Montana was so close and so far away that there is talk of a new agreement, a new understanding, a new encounter. Do you think that, with all the experiences of nearly fifty years of failed talks, the Annan plan, which got nowhere, will be worth a new meeting or serve to permanently maintain a division that decisively affects the national and economic future of the island as well? And so I am asking you, Mr President: wouldn't it be time for us, by abandoning external protectors, which are actually external blockers many times, to go to arbitration by the member countries of the European Union — from their European family — and end the pathology of the island of Cyprus?", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 8, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Neoklis SYLIKIOTIS", "mepid": "124689", "text": "  on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, allow me on behalf of the Left Group to express our shock at yesterday's victims of the attack, to express our condolences to the family of the victims and our sympathy and solidarity with the city of Strasbourg and the entire French people. Mr President of the Republic of Cyprus, I welcome you from the European United Left/Northern Green Left to the European Parliament, transferring first of all the universal, timeless, undying support of our group in the struggle of Cyprus against occupation and division, for a solution of the Cyprus problem on the basis of un resolutions, international and European law, for the reunification of Cyprus on the basis of the solution of the bi-social bi-community federation, for a Cyprus without occupying armies and foreign guardians, common homeland of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots. That is why, Mr Vice-President of the European Commission, the Union has a responsibility, instead of discussing today the upgrading of the Customs Union with Turkey, to resolutely demand the implementation of Ankara's obligations, including the Cyprus obligations.  Mr President, if we are debating today with concern and fear about the future of Europe, it is because something has gone wrong with the past and the present of the Union, with the course it has taken, with the policies that dominate, because in previous years the anxieties of the people and the demands of the workers have not been heard. Only two years ago in this Chamber President Juncker was forced to admit that the European Union is losing its social character, that it is in danger of becoming the Wild West of social dumping. But he did not admit what policies led to it. The relentless truth is that the recipe for neoliberalism has been followed, with the result that European societies are reaping unemployment, poverty, regional and social inequalities, while at the same time it is these policies that are smoothing the ground for racism, xenophobia and fascism. Those who do not recognize the cause will obviously continue with the same recipes and on the same path.  Cyprus is unfortunately no exception. It is a prime example, because the memoranda expire but they don't actually go away. Their dramatic consequences have not only remained in society and in industrial relations in a number of Member States, but have now become pan-European laws within the framework of economic governance. What is remarkable is that your government, Mr President, is not only implementing these policies but is proving to be more neoliberal than neoliberals. What's the result? The growth you project is only for the benefit of the few. Unfortunately, our country is a champion in Europe in increasing income inequality and increasing poverty.  Let us not forget, moreover, that the two major financial crimes committed in recent years in Cyprus, the haircut of deposits in 2013 and the closure of the Co-operation, do not only have the stamp of the European Union; they are also your achievements, Mr President.  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what Europe needs today is social justice and social solidarity. It needs an economy that works for the many, those who produce wealth, not for banks and multinationals.  Another path of growth that creates permanent full and decent jobs. To defend the public nature of each country's strategic sectors and services. Strengthen social protection for the weak and not distribute greetings without any binding force, such as the notorious European social pillar. The European Union needs a bold policy to tackle climate change outside market logic and more ambitious than the Paris agreement. When the citizens of the Union hear that EUR 38.5 billion will be given to the defence fund, they reasonably wonder how there can always be money for the war industries but never enough for social expenditure, education and health.  Finally, Europe needs an asylum and immigration policy based on international law, humanitarian solidarity with refugees and solidarity between Member States. Rightly, Mr President, Cyprus supports the need to create a permanent mechanism for hosting all refugees in all Member States according to their capabilities. But, Mr President, first of all you must put this request to the European People's Party, to those like-minded people who block this proposal, so that the countries of the Mediterranean South receive a disproportionate share of responsibility. Mr President, in order to do all this, we need other policies, or better yet we need another Europe, the Europe for which the Left is fighting, The Europe that resists and fights, the Europe of the peoples.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Ska KELLER", "mepid": "96734", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, I would like to join colleagues in expressing my solidarity with the victims of yesterday’s attack and their relatives. I would like to thank all the emergency services and everyone who helped yesterday in the city, as well as here in the European Parliament. President Anastasiades, thank you very much for joining us in this debate on the future of Europe. Cyprus is, of course, in a very difficult spot on the European map. Your island is still divided, and I want to applaud you for all the efforts that you have undertaken in the past to overcome this divide and to get closer together for a solution on the island, based on the UN parameters. But I am also worried that we haven’t seen much progress – any progress, really – on the talks recently. I would really like to urge you not to let this favourable political constellation pass  by, because we might not have that opportunity in a long time – we might never see it again. We have a once-in-a-lifetime chance to find that solution. And just as in Europe overall, a united Cyprus will be beneficial for all its citizens. The EU also needs to be there and ready to provide any help necessary to achieve a solution.  And you are in that unique situation right now to overcome the last divide in Europe, to bridge the last divided capital in Europe, and I wish you a lot of luck in dealing with that situation. But I’m also afraid that luck alone won’t be enough. It also needs common action by all of us. You are in a very unique spot, so it will need a lot of courage and a lot of action. President Anastasiades, I am very grateful that you brought up the issue of climate change. I  have to tell you that not many of your colleagues have done so before you, and of course Cyprus is also one of the countries that’s most affected by climate change in the European Union, even though none of us is going to be spared. We’ve seen desertification happening on the island, also extreme weather events. All those effects of climate change are very well known in Cyprus. Right now, we have the Climate Summit happening in Katowice, and the EU’s role in achieving a safeguard for our common planet is absolutely vital. But the EU can only be as strong as its members are – and are willing to be – so I’m asking you: what is your government strategy and concrete proposals to mitigate the impact of climate change in Cyprus? And what can you do in order to pressurise the other Member States to do their share as well, because not everyone is really helpful in doing so? And of course to put words into actions we also need exactly the money in the long term budget that Mr Katainen mentioned earlier. The MFF will be absolutely crucial in putting money behind words. Words alone are not enough, and we need to act now in order to save that planet, because we only have one. Cyprus would have a great potential, for example, for renewable energy. It could be a frontrunner in this regard, showing other Member States the way forward, showing the whole EU how it could be done, and it could also become a hotspot for the relevant technology – but only if your government is ready to do something for that.  Finally, I would like to stress that the future of Europe depends on all of us. It doesn’t only depend on big countries, some countries; it depends on all countries. It depends on all of us together – bigger or smaller countries, north or south, all Member States have a responsibility to bring Europe forward or it will not go forward. And we, in this House, also share that responsibility. No matter what party we are from, no matter which country we are from, the future of the European Union depends on all of us inside this House, but of course also on each and every citizen.

Mr President, France, like other European countries, was struck again, bloodied, bereaved by terrorism, last night, right here in Strasbourg. On behalf of our europe of nations and freedoms group, I would like to express my condolences and solidarity with the victims, their families and loved ones. The fight against Islamist terrorism must be a top priority and we have the responsibility and the duty to give ourselves the means to wage this war that is being waged on us, and to win it. Mr President, since 1974, your country, Cyprus, has suffered a scandalous Turkish occupation over half of its territory. Yes, the invasion by the Turkish army and the ensuing occupation are scandalous, but who is still moved by it? The truth is that the European Union has never supported Cyprus against the Turks. On the contrary, it has been more than 30 years since Turkey entered into negotiations to join the European Union, having benefited from a particularly advantageous association agreement since 1963.  Each year, under the pre-accession appropriations, the European Union provides aid far in excess of those received by Member States such as Cyprus. Refusing any tussle with Erdogan, who dreams of a new Ottoman empire, the European institutions yield to all his demands, which are all whims of a spoiled child to whom one never knew how to say no. We swaggered when Turkey signed an agreement on migrants, but it was actually a new market of dupes. Turkey has pocketed a few billion from the generous Europeans, and the counterparties are obviously not up to scratch. That is clearly what we are seeing in Cyprus, by the way, at the moment. Just yesterday, we learned that more than half of the 8,000 asylum seekers you have in Cyprus had arrived quietly from the north of the island thanks to Turkish smugglers. 8,000, for a country of less than a million people, is a lot, and the migratory pressure has increased even more in recent weeks. But Turkey's dirty role should not absolve you of your own responsibilities. On Monday, after your country signed the ill-fated Global Compact on Migration in Marrakech, you celebrated International Human Rights Day. \"With rights and freedoms for all,\" you said, but without duties or constraints. You are therefore well in tune with the authors of this suicidal text for the European nations. Yes, suicidal, since it is a question of removing the very concept of illegal immigration in order to create a kind of universal right to migration, for men without links, above ground, cut off from their roots. Some argue that this text would not be binding, but then why did the United States, Australia, Israel, so many European countries refuse to sign it? And why, then, did the government coalition in Belgium simply explode because of this text and the disagreements that concerned it? But I would also like to look back at the financial and banking crisis that hit your country in 2012 and 2013. The Cypriots served as guinea pigs for the austerity cures that the troika would soon impose on Greece of the very docile Alexis Tsipras, Mr Mélenchon's friend. The connivances between European leaders and the banks are no longer to be demonstrated, from Macron to Barroso, who went to slippers at Goldman Sachs, as soon as he finished his term as head of the European Commission.  Hence the custom creation - I dare not say on order - of the single resolution mechanism. As in Cyprus, in the event of a bank's bankruptcy, it is the savers who will have to pay the bill again, since their accounts could be automatically punctured. This is despite the cost of bailing out European banks in 2008. This is akin to a real racketeering in gangs organized, by the state and by the banks, and this is precisely what the yellow vests are revolting against in my country, France.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 11, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Georgios EPITIDEIOS", "mepid": "125071", "text": "   Mr President, after condemning the terrorist attack in Strasbourg and wishing condolences to the families of the dead and injured, I too welcome you to the European Parliament.

Why, in this context, do you legitimise the presence of settlers in the occupied territories when you know that settlement is a war crime and that settlers are used as a means to change, to change the demographic composition of the country? Why, while Turkey does not recognise the Republic of Cyprus, do you not activate the right of veto to demand that the European Union immediately stop discussions on Turkey's accession and financing? Why do you not complain about the European Union's funding of Turkish Cypriots under the annual action programme of EUR 34.5 million? Why do you not protect the citizens of the Republic of Cyprus when the authorities, the illegal authorities of the pseudo-state, acting as legitimate, arrest and imprison them? Why do you allow the roadblocks to be opened when you know the economic consequences, smuggling, illegal work and the increase in crime that this entails? Above all, why did you allow the opening of the roadblock of Deryneia, which is interwoven with the murder of Isaac and Solomos? And finally, why didn't you prevent the sale of the German Leopard 2A4 tanks to the occupying forces in order to upgrade their fighting power?  Are you going to ask the European Union to impose an arms embargo on Turkey and the pseudo-state? Thank you very much and I look forward to your answers.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 12, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Νίκος Αναστασιάδης", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of Cyprus. Mr President, first of all I would like to express warm thanks both to the Vice-President and to the leaders of the various political groups in the European Parliament both for the kind words and possible criticisms that have been made. Criticism when it is in good faith, when based on evidence and evidence, is a guide for a government to adjust policies and adopt such decisions that create even better conditions for the living of its citizens. I would like to make a general reference to the Cyprus problem, the economy, the inequality that has been heard, political citizenship, policies concerning the granting of political citizenship, etc. With regard to the Cyprus issue, I must make it clear that the Greek Cypriot side has made major concessions for more than 44.5 years. We are talking about a state that was completely united with residents who lived in mixed communities. It consisted of mixed communities, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots.  As a result of the crime and the actions of the Greek junta against Makarios, with the excuse and pretext of protecting the Turkish Cypriots, Turkey invaded to restore constitutional order, despite the fact that no action was directed against the Turkish Cypriots, despite the fact that Makarios returned to Cyprus, the constitutional order was restored. Nevertheless, Turkey used the anachronistic right to intervene, invaded and divided the Republic of Cyprus, as has been its policy since 1956.  Since then, since the invasion, we have reached a historic but painful compromise: to accept the bi-social bi-community federation. We have made efforts, we have accepted political equality, we have accepted active, effective participation in the various institutions. However, every time we grant, in order to find a solution, some excessive – if you will – or excessive democracy-based rights, the Turkish Cypriots come back in Turkey's submission to demand more. Let me give you an example: The claim of the Turkish Cypriot community, which represents 20% of the population of Cyprus, to have a positive vote for every decision of the central state, whether it is the government or any other institution, tell me how it can be accepted? Nevertheless, and for the sake of finding a solution, we have said that we do not deny the right to a positive vote, if and when it will be exercised in order to protect the rights of the Turkish Cypriot community from any decisions that the majority can take against abuse of rights and to the detriment of the Turkish Cypriot community, since there is still of course an effective mechanism for resolving disputes. It wasn't accepted.  I come to Cran Medan, where we were very close and far away. We were indeed very close if the six positions of the parameters were adopted, as The Secretary-General of the United Nations put it, mr. Gutierrez for the creation of a normal state. What were these six conditions: the abolition of anachronistic guarantees, invasive rights, a vertical reduction of the occupying army limited to 650 and 950, i.e. the guarantee treaties and the treaty establishing the Republic of Cyprus, the way in which the Turkish Cypriots exercised their right to a positive vote, in which institutions, when and how it is exercised and how the smooth functioning of the State is ensured. , the issues of the territorial adjustments that were absolutely necessary, the issues of the property of the Greek Cypriots – the problem must be settled – but also an additional claim by Turkey for equal treatment of Greek nationals with Turkish nationals, as if Greek nationals were given preferential treatment. The Greeks are not given preferential treatment. The greeks are treated in the same way by the rest of the Europeans, but the claim was: for every Greek established under European law in Cyprus, we should have the presence of a Turkish national respectively.  And I ask you: We are only eight hundred thousand. If this were to be accepted, would we or would we not in no time alter the demographic character when this is already happening in the occupied area? Today there are more Turkish nationals than Turkish Cypriots. Therefore, what hindered the resolution of the Cyprus problem in Cran Medan was not that we do not care about the solution of the Cyprus problem. I should note that we had submitted answers on all six points of the Secretary-General, structured and comprehensive. Those who refused and insisted on guarantees, invasive rights, a military base, equal treatment, a positive vote were Turkey and the Turkish Cypriots. And I ask you: Which one of you would take on such a burden, give his consent and return home believing that it would be possible in a referendum to obtain the approval of such a solution? So it is obvious who led and how we were led to the impasse. Nevertheless, we insist and move forward and insist on starting a new dialogue from where we were, as long as there is good preparation, as the Secretary-General is asking for. I would like to say that within the next few days Mrs Lout, the Secretary-General's representative, will be in Cyprus. We are determined to work together. What we expect is for the other side to show the same good will. And I want to make one thing clear: that our aim, yes, is to find a peaceful solution, but – most importantly of all – not a solution for some days but a solution that is sustainable and, in order to be sustainable, must be functional and, in order to be operational, the conditions as set by Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot side cannot be accepted.  As far as the economy is concerned, I would like to say that not only do we not regret the decisions we have found ourselves obliged to accept, but we are also grateful, because, if we are not in the European Union, I do not know who would finance us so that the state does not go bankrupt, and I would remind you that in 2013, when we took over, we had cash available for civil servants' salaries of just one month and obligations until June that exceeded three billion.  Immediate action therefore had to be taken. Taken. There was also a proposal more favourable than the one that was finally adopted. Parliament did not accept it; But it must be said that by taking decisive and bold steps we have also achieved reforms and rationalisation of the economy and we are determined to continue in this way. The policy of nationalities: I want to say that somewhere there is a strong – if you will – targeting of Cyprus. I would like to inform you that in the last five years from 2013 to August 2018 the total number of nationalities granted by the Republic of Cyprus does not exceed 4,700, i.e. it represents 0.3% of the total nationalities granted by other States of the European Union. We have strict criteria in place. We've been audited by Moneyval. We have adopted policies that limit the number of people a year who can obtain Cypriot citizenship. We try and have decided to employ a foreign company in order to control the necessary procedures but also to exercise control over the financial resources of investors. We are very careful to avoid cases such as what I hear some people say, that some people are allowed to acquire European citizenship at the expense of the security of the European Union. But in Cyprus there has never been a terrorist attack! It's not in my country where the terrorist attacks take place. It is not in my country that most football teams belonging to oligarchs from other countries, third countries, or central points and large buildings and large real estate have passed into the hands of either Russian oligarchs, Arabs or others. That is not a bad thing, but a small country cannot be targeted because it has granted 0.3% of the nationalities granted by the other states of Europe, and I do not want to mention how many tens of thousands have been granted by the various countries. I'm stopping here. With regard to some phenomena on the issues of inequality and so on, I would just like to say that, when we took power, the economy was in the junks category. 22 downgrades. Today we have managed to overcome through upgrades all the problems and be back in the investment tier. We have a growth rate of 4% for the fourth year; we have been presenting budget surpluses of up to 3% for the last three years; unemployment has fallen from 16%, when we received the state, to 7%. And all this supposedly impoverished the Cypriots. Of course it is everyone's right to judge as they wish. What I want to say is that our ears are open to hear suggestions. We are ready to work with everyone to achieve better days for our country. And I conclude by reiterating that Cyprus is always ready to cooperate for the best possible and for a perspective and future of the European Union. Depending on our size, we are doing everything possible to consolidate regional peace, to establish strong regional cooperation, which is also in the interests of the European Union. So we will continue to be civilized in the belief that we can achieve much more together, as long as there is unity, as long as there is solidarity, as long as there is a common goal: the future of our common European home.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 13, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Ramón Luis VALCÁRCEL SISO", "mepid": "125032", "text": "   – Mr President, President Anastasiades, allow me, first of all, to convey my solidarity to the Cypriot people in the wake of last week's torrential rains, which claimed the lives of at least four people in Kyrenia.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I will be very brief. Most of the answers were given during my secondology. What I consider to be the first thing is to thank, among other things, the European Parliament and the Commission in particular for its support for the Missing in their efforts to ensure that another humanitarian problem, which is the verification of the fate of the missing, receives greater attention and under pressure to finally allow Turkey to open up 30 new sites located in military zones. , as they are called. I wish we could change geography and move either Turkey or us elsewhere, but as you can see we are doomed by geography to live side by side, which is why we prefer Turkey to be a European country rather than an uncontrolled country that can have expansive aspirations that often put security at risk.  As regards the issues of German tanks, they are being investigated by both the German and Cypriot governments. What I want to reiterate in conclusion is to reaffirm my determination and willingness to work with determination and courage, as much as is necessary, in order to achieve a solution that will finally allow the peaceful coexistence of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots in a state – and I want to stress this – that can function, be able to inspire, give duration, give perspective to all residents. , regardless of race, color, origin and so on, religion and so on. We can prove this in the future, as long as there are not those elements that give the right to overturn the desired objective, that is, a state where its citizens live and are guaranteed with all the privileges of other European citizens.

(Applause) I also greet Mrs Natalya Kaplan and Mr Dmitry Dinze, who represent the winner, Mr Oleg Sentsov. I want to call them to say hello and then to bring the session to life. Ladies and gentlemen, today, on a sad day for all of us, we pay tribute to Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian director and writer who has been detained for political reasons. He is the winner of this year's Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. Sentsov is rewarded for his peaceful protest against Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea, his homeland. He is also awarded the prize for his determination and commitment to the defence of human rights and dignity, democracy and the rule of law. The construction of Europe is based on these values, even more so today after yesterday's terrible attack. This Parliament will always be at the forefront of defending the freedom and dignity of the person, inside and outside the European Union. Oleg Sentsov, with his courage, hunger strikes and imprisonment, is a symbol of the struggle for freedom of political prisoners held in Russia and the rest of the world. I would like to extend a warm welcome to Natalya Kaplan and Dmitry Dinze, Sentsov's cousin and lawyer respectively, who are here today to represent him. Last July, the European Parliament called for the immediate and unreserved release of Oleg and all other Ukrainian citizens illegally detained in Russia and the Crimean peninsula. Today we want to make this request very strongly. I would also like to welcome Christophe Deloire, Secretary-General of Reporters Without Borders, winner of the 2005 Sakharov Prize, and the other finalists this year. I welcome the representatives of non-governmental organisations working to defend the rights of migrants and save lives in the Mediterranean. Then we greet, and I have already said goodbye, the parents of Nasser Zefzafi. (Applause) We also call for his immediate release. (Applause) You've seen the video that introduces us to this year's winner. Two days ago, we celebrated the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The European Parliament wanted to celebrate this anniversary by dedicating a whole week to human rights. Unfortunately, the battle for the defence of human rights is far from being won. Everywhere in the world men and women are persecuted for their ideas, for their beliefs, for their denunciations of authoritarian regimes. They are being suppressed for demanding freedom and justice alone. Thousands of journalists risk their lives every day. Many are killed or imprisoned to defend the truth and our freedom. All too often the powerful on duty trample underfoot the principles enshrined in this Declaration. This should not, however, discourage us but, on the contrary, make our efforts double, because our citizens are calling for a more effective Europe, one that provides the means to act and to promote the human rights of the world with determination. The Sakharov Prize was established thirty years ago to support individuals and organisations that are dedicated, body and soul, to the defence of justice, even at the risk of their own safety. Since then it has become the most followed human rights initiative in Europe. Five of our winners have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and just last Monday Dr Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad received this important award. In May of this year, Oleg Sentsov began a hunger strike, calling for the release of Ukrainian political prisoners held in Russia. After 145 days he was forced to interrupt him due to his critical state of health and the threat of forced feeding. The Russian Human Rights Center \"Memorial\", winner of the Sakharov Prize in 2009, granted Sentsov political prisoner status. The European Film Academy and a large number of directors, associations and personalities have repeatedly called for his release.  This year's Sakharov Prize is being awarded in a climate of renewed tension between Russia and Ukraine. The recent incidents in the Sea of Azov and violations of international law have contributed to further aggravating the situation. We reiterate our call to avoid escalation and our firm condemnation of any action against ukraine's territorial integrity. I would like to conclude by thinking of all the winners of our prize who are facing serious difficulties today. I am thinking of Nasrin Sotoudeh, who was arrested in Iran in June. concerned about her situation and also for her we call for immediate release. Tomorrow, Parliament will also adopt an urgent resolution on your case.  I am also thinking of Raif Badawi, winner in 2015, who is still in prison for peacefully defending freedom of expression in Saudi Arabia. I am thinking of Leopoldo López, who is under house arrest in Venezuela, Razan Zaitouneh, who was kidnapped in Syria several years ago and whose fate, unfortunately, is still uncertain. I am thinking of the Chinese activist Hu Jia, who lives under constant surveillance, and the Las Damas de Blanco movement, whose members are constantly being intimidated in Cuba. Not forgetting Sentsov himself: we look forward to receiving him in Parliament to give him the Sakharov Prize in person, because this is not just a prize but a commitment we make to our winners. Today I want to say to all of you who are not alone in the struggle: this Parliament will always be at your side!

First of all, he is a film director and a man with a capital ‘M’. He was an economist, but he never did any business. As a young man, he was enthusiastic about cybersports, and all the time he was reproached that computer games are not very serious and that he should start thinking about something else. But he started making his living playing games, bought a computer club and organised a team of cyber-sportsmen. But, slowly, he started retreating from this sport and watching more and more films. And then he understood that he had a lot to say and should start making movies. We became friends when Oleg was an adult. When we were both adults, his first short film, A Perfect Day for Bananafish, he filmed with his daughter Alina playing one of the characters. Oleg called this film educational: he just wanted to learn the process of making films and he showed it only to his inner circle.  He was a very goal-oriented person with an acute sense of justice. He made his first film without any education, experience, connections or budget, and his first film, Gamer, he financed himself. Funding was insufficient, but he succeeded in organising the whole process on the basis of enthusiasm. Many of his professional colleagues looked at him as yet another graphomaniac, and nobody believed that he would make a good movie. The result was, however, that he did a tour of the world and cinematographers perceived him as a fully-fledged colleague. In 2013, he started to work on his second film, Rhinoceros, the casting was done and he was planning to start filming, but the work was halted as a result of the events on Maidan. Practically from the first days of Maidan, he joined AutoMaidan – the activists who brought food, medical supplies and all necessary supplies to Maidan by car, and blocked the roads. Oleg was an office manager. He was in charge of the logistics of AutoMaidan, he coordinated people, directed everybody, and was perceived as a very good organiser by the people united by a common idea. At that time, we started communicating with Oleg much more often. He had no doubt in the victory of the activists. Then he went back to his native Crimea, but he couldn’t relax there. Little green men appeared on the Peninsula, and he once again joined the resistance. Oleg started bringing food, medical supplies and water to the Ukrainian resistance. When the little green men allowed the Ukrainian military to leave Crimea, he organised their leave.  In March 2014, Russia applauded Putin, praising him for the annexation of Crimea, and Ukraine was counting its dead and disappeared at the time. The repressive machine started operating in Crimea. It was well orchestrated and already worked well in all the occupied territories inside Russia, and especially in Chechnya. In April 2014, an anti-terrorist department was created in Crimea. Where there is a department, it is automatically thought that there should be terrorists, and Russian law—enforcement bodies started catching so-called ‘terrorists’ in order to earn new stars on their epaulettes. On 10 May, FSB people entered Oleg’s apartment; apart from him, only his 11—year-old daughter Alina was there. They searched his apartment in front of his daughter and confiscated train tickets from Simferopol and Kiev and back, along with a letter with a poem in Ukrainian, the computer, money saved for filming and some DVDs. They took two classic films from his collection: Fascism As It Is and a history of the Third Reich in colour. Thus they were trying to prove that Oleg had fascist and Nazis opinions. The FSB alleged that Oleg had been involved with the Ukrainian organisation ‘Right Sector’. It was this organisation that Russian propaganda used as a horror story for Crimeans, saying how they would destroy the Russians. The irony is that Oleg himself is a Russian speaker and considers himself as a Russian. In the same case, three more people were detained, historian Alexei Chirnii, the photographer and lawyer Gennadi Afanasiev, and a left-wing activist member of the environmental movement in the Crimea, anti-fascist Alexander Kolchenko. Chirnii and Afanasiev testified against Oleg. They were tortured, beaten and threatened with more violence. Oleg Sentsov was also tortured. The official documents indicated that he was detained on 11 May. It actually happened on 10 May. For a whole day, the FSB officers tried to beat a testimony out of him, against the Ukrainian authorities, against other people. When Oleg refused, he was told they would then make him the organiser of a terrorist cell and that he would go to a prison camp for 20 years. Oleg refused and that was the sentence he was given. At trial, Afanasiev recanted his testimony, stating that he had given it under torture, but the court did not investigate the statement, in fact ignoring the crime. This was also the case with Sentsov’s testimony. He repeatedly claimed that he had been tortured, and related what they had done to him. He had been beaten, choked and threatened with rape with a police baton, but the torture case was never opened. The answer came that Sentsov had traces of beatings as a result of sado-masochistic inclinations. After his arrest, the lawyers and consuls couldn’t find him anywhere. For two weeks, the hired lawyers tried to gain access to him, but they were hiding him, saying that he was in transit or in another pre-trial prison. And all the time he was in custody the Ukrainian consuls could not be allowed to visit him because he was a Russian citizen – allegedly, after the occupation he did not renounce his Russian citizenship under the official procedure and so automatically became a Russian citizen. Sentsov himself said: ‘I am not a serf. I cannot be transferred with the earth. I was, and remain, a citizen of Ukraine.’ There is no Russian passport in the criminal case, although Oleg was repeatedly forced to get one. It was only before he was sent to the colony in Yakutia, to the north of Russia, that the Ukrainian consuls were admitted to see Oleg. It happened just once. In Yakutia, which is 9 000 kilometres away from his native Crimea, he was kept for a year. He was hidden away from his relatives, from any possibility of their visiting him. Actually, Oleg did not want his relatives to visit him, because it would have been really difficult for him emotionally. After the Pussy Riot action held in Yakutia, Oleg was promptly transferred to the Arctic Circle, to the city of Labytnangi, and at the moment Oleg is in one of the northernmost prisons in the world. This is a strict regime colony on the Yamalo Peninsula. To send a southerner to the Arctic is a separate torture. Very soon, Oleg began to lose his hair and his teeth began to crumble, but Oleg is a person who cannot give up and just sit quietly. He is a fighter by nature, and the only method of fighting that he saw was a hunger strike.  On 14 May 2018, he declared a hunger strike. He agreed to stop it only when all the Ukrainian political prisoners were released from Russian prisons and prisons in the occupied Crimea, and by the most conservative estimates that amounted to 79 people. During his hunger strike, Oleg’s already undermined health began to deteriorate rapidly. His relatives feared for his life, and knowing who Oleg is, they understood that it was impossible to convince him. He would go to the very end – to the deadly end. All his internal organs suffered. The liver had enlarged, they removed a kidney stone, and he developed problems with his intestines and stomach. His internal organs did not receive enough oxygen, hypoxia began, and the effects reached the brain. In order to avoid force-feeding, Oleg agreed to medication maintenance, but his condition was still worsening every day. On 5 October, after 145 days of his hunger strike, Sentsov announced its termination. The reason was a statement by the officers that they would begin force—feeding him. Oleg understood the hunger strike would stop anyway, but he had a choice: to be tortured again, to lie fettered with a tube stuck up his nose, or to stop on his own. In order to avoid additional suffering, he chose the second option.  During all the 145 days, not a single Ukrainian political prisoner had been released, but this does not mean that Oleg lost. Thanks to his act, the whole world spoke about repression by Russia and Oleg drew great attention to the topic of Ukrainian political prisoners – and that is his victory. Especially for this occasion, he wrote an address to everyone here. I will now read it for you. ‘Ladies and gentlemen, I cannot be present in this room right now, but you can hear my words, even if someone else is saying them. The word is the main tool of a person, and often his only tool, especially when everything else has been taken from him. In a word you can cure, you can maim, you can save, and you can kill by commanding fire. There are people whose words mean a lot. There are people vested with power and opportunities, but they use the power of their words in different ways. You can call for acceptance and surrender, but on the contrary you can call for resistance and for fighting, even when there is no chance to survive but only a chance to die. But it is not so important how long you live, but how. No matter when you die, more important is how and for what. You can be a simple peasant, less than 18 years old, and then with your own words raise up a whole country to resist, accept humiliation and martyrdom, and then stay forever in history under the name of Joan. Or you can live as a bloody ruler to a ripe old age, tirelessly uttering a flood of false words that your people would supposedly admire, and world leaders would even shake hands with you, not wanting to quarrel with you, but after your death your name will be cursed right away, and the word ‘Bokassa’ will become a common word. Modernity is often not fair. History is always fair. Over time, everything falls into place and is called by its proper name. And someone rushes down to the garbage heap under the curses of the liberated people, along with the fragments of monuments to himself. And someone who was persecuted and almost despised by us, on the contrary, after death, takes a worthy place in world history, and his name is given to streets, ships and awards.

In the sense, we asked for this topic before the so—called gilets jaunes, but of course it is in connection with that. Last weekend, we had 75 000 people walking the streets of Brussels to ask for more ambition with regard to climate change. And on the other hand, you have the gilets jaunes in France but also in parts of Belgium. This could sound like a contradiction, two different manifestations, but actually it isn’t. It’s actually rather logical and understandable. People do understand the necessity and the urgency of fighting climate change, and they do demand urgent action of Europe and the Member States. But they cannot, they will not and they should not accept the fact that they are the only ones that will have to pay the bill for that: bad air quality, health risk, diminishing purchase power, job losses, unaffordable bills when it comes to energy, bad housing conditions. Think about our polluting cars and, at the same time, the new electric cars unaffordable for so many people. These people are not climate sceptics, but maybe they will become climate sceptics if we do not make sure that we make a just transition. Yes, we need a transition, but it will only be a good one when it is a just one. And for us, the S&amp;D Group, it is not just a necessity or a purely economic process of changing business sectors and securing competition. No, for us the social dimension is absolutely clear. Yes, coal mines: they need to be shut down. And yes, we will have to get rid of the combustion engine. But not while at the same time making all these things unaffordable for families and putting territories or families into uncertainty or even poverty. And in that sense, I think we need coordinated action to make that a just transition. Let me give you a few examples. First of all, just transition should be a key concept in all policy processes at all levels. Second, we need a radical change in the governance of the European Union. Broadening the European semester with social and ecological indicators which have the same weight as the economic, the fiscal and the debt indicators –that is also key. Investing in clean and sustainable industries and technologies and keeping these investments off the balance sheet, because otherwise we will not have enough room to make these investments. Creating new specific funds for just transition and dedicating money in existing funds and programmes within the Multiannual Financial Framework. And also making sure no investments go against these just transition principles. And to make a just transition successful, we need a profound social dialogue in this case. This should involve governments at all different levels, workers and their unions, employers, businesses and NGOs to work and cooperate together. We have no alternative. We have to make this transition, but by making sure we do this in a just way, putting people and social values at the core of our sustainable agenda, we will be able to get everybody on board and turn this transition into a successful Europe. The two most important challenges – and that’s my final word – that we are all facing are climate change and rising inequalities. Let’s pull them together and make sure that we come into a concept of sustainable equality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 60, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Juliane Bogner-Strauss", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I would like to thank Parliament for raising this very important topic and for giving me the chance to take the floor on behalf of the Council. The timing of this debate is apt, given that international climate negotiators are currently gathered at COP24 in Katowice in Poland, discussing, inter alia, solidarity and ‘just transition’. The topic was immediately brought to the fore when, on 3 December 2018, at the leaders’ summit taking place during the conference, the Polish Presidency of COP24 announced the adoption of the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration. The European Union joined the representatives of 45 states in giving its full support to the declaration, which remains open for others to join it. The Silesia Declaration underlines that a just transition of the workforce and the safeguarding and creation of sustainable employment and decent work are crucial to ensuring public support for long—term emission reductions. The EU’s support for the declaration, alongside that of its Member States, is an important signal to the international community, showing our commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement.  You are all aware of the enormous scale and urgency of the challenge that climate change poses to humankind. If left unconstrained, climate change will lead to large-scale and irreversible negative consequences for our environment and ecosystems, and for our economies. Action against climate change is more urgent than ever. The Paris Agreement sets the goal of achieving net—zero greenhouse gas emissions globally in the second half of this century. The EU has long been at the forefront of the global response to climate change. It already has in place a legislative framework for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions up to 2030 and it has managed successfully to decouple greenhouse gas emissions from economic growth since the 1990s. However, we know that, even though they are among the most ambitious in the international context, the policies the EU has in place today will not be enough to contribute in a sufficient manner to the achievement of the Paris Agreement’s temperature goals. According to the Paris Agreement, all parties are to present long-term, low-greenhouse-gas-emission development strategies by 2020. On 28 November, responding to calls by the Council and Parliament to present a long-term strategy for the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the Commission published a communication on a long—term strategy for the European Union. It outlines a vision of the economic and societal transformations required, while also seeking to ensure that the transition to net—zero greenhouse gas emissions is socially fair. Discussions of the long-term strategy within the Council have already started and, before the end of our Presidency, it will be debated by Ministers responsible for energy at the Council meeting scheduled for 19 December, and by those responsible for the environment on 20 December. The challenges posed by global climate change will require huge economic and societal transformation, which includes the continuing modernisation of European industries and economies with, notably, a transition to clean energy systems. Just transition is an imperative that was included in the Paris Agreement to ensure that the consequences for the workforce of climate change measures in regions and communities which stand to be particularly affected by them are taken into account. Some regions, globally and in Europe, are more dependent than others on carbon-intensive industries or on coal mining. Today, 41 regions in 12 EU countries are actively mining coal, and many face significant economic and social challenges. The transition towards low—carbon and climate—resilient economies and societies should ensure a just transition of the workforce, with the creation of decent work and quality jobs for all. While many sectors, cities and regions which are highly reliant on fossil fuels and high-emitting industries face undeniable challenges, the transition to climate—resilient economies also has the potential to create additional employment opportunities. According to a report published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO), this year, jobs created in renewable energy, building efficiency and other low—carbon industries can more than offset job losses in other sectors. However, policies will be needed to protect workers in the sectors where there will be fewer jobs in the future. The Silesia Declaration mentions the importance of the ILO guidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies for all, and emphasises that the UN 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals confirm the need to tackle environmental, social and economic problems in a coherent and creative manner. Ensuring a just transition for the workers and communities concerned requires a participatory and progressive representative process of social dialogue, involving all social partners. Just transition is finding its way into important pieces of EU legislation on climate and energy policy. With the inclusion of just transition as one of the investment priorities of the new Modernisation Fund, the revised Emissions Trading System (ETS) Directive will play an important role in supporting regions in 10 low-income Member States, which are dependent on carbon-intensive industries, during their move towards a low—carbon economy. Projects financed under the Modernisation Fund should support the redeployment, reskilling and upskilling of workers, education, jobseeking initiatives and start-ups, in dialogue with the social partners. In addition, the revised directive highlights the use of auction revenues by Member States for the purpose of promoting skills formation and the reallocation of labour in order to contribute to a just transition to a low—carbon economy, in particular in regions most affected by the jobs transition. In both cases, Member States are responsible for designing and implementing the relevant support schemes. It is to be noted that support is also available from a number of existing EU programmes and funding instruments. It is a very positive sign that the international community, governments, businesses and trade unions are increasingly paying attention to the just transition agenda. This is a conversation which needs to continue and to be as inclusive and participatory as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 2, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 10, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 61, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Marianne THYSSEN", "mepid": "1832", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, first of all I would like to thank the honourable Members for tabling this important and topical debate. We can only have a clean transition if it is also a just transition, and we can only have a safer planet if we involve our workers and our citizens.  This is a tale of two cities. While we are debating the issue today in Strasbourg, the UN Climate Conference – the COP24 – is taking place in Katowice. Katowice is a city in Poland’s region of Silesia, one of Europe’s most coal-intensive regions and, as such, Silesia perfectly illustrates the social economic challenges, but also opportunities, of transition to a low—carbon economy. This is why COP24 started last week by signing the Silesia Declaration on Solidarity and Just Transition, a declaration endorsed by the European Union as a whole and 20 EU Member States individually, a declaration which stresses that environmental and social developments must go hand—in—hand.  Our European climate policy is the most forward-looking in the world. We aim to reduce our emissions by at least 40% by 2030, but the Paris Agreement requires us to look further into the future. Two weeks ago, we published our proposal for the European Union’s long-term strategy, a long—term strategy on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, and the proposal shows how Europe can lead the way to climate neutrality by 2050 by investing in technological solutions, by empowering citizens, by taking action in industrial policy finance and research, and by ensuring social fairness.  We need to decisively tackle climate change, and there are more benefits besides those clearly related to environment and health. Already today the transformation is creating growth – green growth. In Europe, the clean energy sector has created roughly four million jobs; investments into industrial modernisation, energy transformation, the circular economy and clean mobility will create more and better jobs.  But change will come with its challenges and costs. These challenges might not be equally distributed between regions, sectors and between people. Emission-heavy industries need to rethink their industrial processes, and if they don’t, there are job losses, social exclusion and depopulation in the region. The labour market will change. Just like in the digital transition, some jobs will disappear, others will be created, and many jobs will change. Workers in declining sectors need guidance and re-skilling, and we have to realise that some people won’t be able to upskill or re-skill – they need social protection, and that means adequate social protection. Lastly, transition may affect most those who can afford it least – those who can’t invest in energy efficiency or low-carbon solutions. The success of the transition to the low-carbon economy depends on the support of our citizens; it should be seen not as a pet project of the elites. Our policy should be progressive and should not punish the poorest. To avoid polarisation, to avoid inequality, we must base our policies on solidarity. Social fairness should be part of all our climate policies, right from the start. We should not think about corrective actions post factum in order to remedy the consequences. Instead, we should include social and fairness considerations at the outset from the moment we design our policy responses. Also, therefore, we are putting a premium on investment. Our proposal for the new MFF has a strong focus on investment and innovation, with programmes such as Horizon Europe, the Invest Europe Fund, the European Regional and Development Fund, and the dedicated modernisation and innovation funds under the EU Emissions Trading System. We can anticipate skills needs and help workers change jobs by funding retraining and upskilling from the European Social Fund. Our proposal for the post-2020 European Globalisation Adjustment Fund helps workers who risk losing their jobs because of decarbonisation by funding retraining and activation measures. And with the European Pillar of Social Rights, we direct policy attention to support for individual transition through investing in skills and lifelong learning and upskilling and re-skilling, but also through investment and adequate social protection. And we base our approach on partnership. For example, last year we launched the Coal Regions in Transition initiative to facilitate green transition in 41 coal— and carbon—intensive regions located in 12 Member States. Climate change is a fact, and that’s why we are ambitious in our goals, and that’s why we are planning for the long term.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I have been very hesitant to speak at this debate, wondering if the time is right. I want to tell you that the continuation of our debates today is the victory of democracy over terror, the victory of freedom over those who try to muzzle it, so let me speak on the topic on the agenda today, as I originally planned. Six months ago, Emmanuel Macron was received by this assembly as the head of state to whom everything succeeded. He was promised a great destiny and, even then, remember, I intervened to ask you to be vigilant. Eight months later, the cards seem to be being replayed. Indeed, France has been facing a social challenge rare enough to be highlighted for several weeks. Employees, retirees, anonymous people who tighten their belts to make ends meet have united to be heard.  The cause of their anger is simple: the President of the Republic and his fiscal policy, which favours raising taxes and reducing public spending, was a miscalculation. I understand this social grumbling and exasperation of the middle classes and let me tell you that they have nothing to do with the problems of energy transition. Nevertheless, if I support the peaceful demonstration, I do not tolerate the violence that has raged several weekends in a row in Paris and in the provinces, and I want to thank the police and gendarmerie for their exceptional mobilization. After several weeks of total silence, Emmanuel Macron intervened on Monday to try to give pledges in order to stop a protest that he himself has spawned, but the president has been too late and, although the concessions are interesting, although not all, they cost 10 billion euros. Who will fund them? We cannot make promises on credit. Emmanuel Macron has divided the French instead of bringing them together.

Unfortunately, the transformation, including the one that is taking place in Europe, is mainly at the expense of ordinary people, which is why they reject this transformation, which is why the streets of French cities, where 'yellow vests' are protesting, look like this. After all, this protest did not come only from the increase in fuel prices. He came from the conviction that we are dealing with a profound injustice and the detachment of European elites from the fate of ordinary people. President Macron, in a nervous first reflex when these protests came, said that if someone can't afford more expensive fuel, let them buy an electric car, and yet he knows perfectly well that this car is twice as expensive as the standard one. This is reminiscent of the situation of the eighteenth century, and the statement, moreover, of the French Queen Marie Antoinette, who, on the news that peasants are starving in the countryside because they do not have bread, suggested that they eat biscuits. This detachment of European elites from the fate of ordinary people ends badly, and this can be seen not only on the streets of French cities, but also in many other western European countries. The situation is very different in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, in a country like mine, Poland, where, as you have rightly pointed out, a climate summit is taking place.

A safer planet is one where poverty is combated with policies based on solidarity and this political imperative is not left to the random growth of the economy and the unpredictable expansion of markets.

Madam President, I would like to begin by saying that today we all have strasbourgers, the victims and their families in our minds. For the past month, yellow vests have been an unprecedented social mobilization that calls for unprecedented responses. The trigger was the increase of a tax on diesel, but the cause comes from further afield: a massive transfer of wealth to the wealthiest in the country, which has been strengthened exponentially since the election of Emmanuel Macron, his choice of \"first ropes\" and the social contempt they display. This reality is particularly felt in rural areas, which are exposed to gender disruptions, whether in terms of transport, access to care or school, and a degraded employment situation. The enemy is therefore not climate policy but neoliberalism, starting with the 100 companies responsible for 71% of global greenhouse gas emissions. If there are punitive measures, they should be exercised on them first. According to the latest IPCC report, we have only 12 years to reduce these emissions, and produce an ambitious climate policy and social justice.  For example, the International Labour Organization estimates that a rapid transition to clean energy could create an additional 18 million jobs worldwide by 2030. There is no shortage of proposals: taxing the 10 billion annual profits of oil companies, taxing aircraft kerosene and heavy fuel from container ships, allocating all environmental taxes to the ecological transition, mobilising bank credit to the European Central Bank, developing real taxation.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, how can we dare to divide society between successful people and people who are nothing? Many of you have written to me, especially from France, since the beginning of the yellow vest movement. In often poignant words, you have told me your anger at being seen as nothing, your displeasure with our democratic institutions, your revolt against injustice in all its forms, especially fiscal, which these institutions perpetuate. You can't stand being taken for fools anymore.  No, enriching the rich - sorry, not throwing stones at the first of ropes - does not benefit everyone. No, strengthening the power of multinationals - sorry, defending our great national champions - is not defending the public interest. None of you condone the violence of the breakers, but, all of you, are speechless in the face of repression. And if the spark of revolt is the taxation of fuels, I know that you have at heart the need for our societies to respect the limits set by nature. Colleagues, the IPCC urges us to embark on a profound ecological transition without delay: we need our planet to become or remain habitable for all. But this transition can only be in solidarity. Let everyone take their share of the effort to the extent of their abilities and that it benefits everyone according to their needs. We know that half of all emissions are produced by the richest 10%. This ecological and solidarity transition must also be fully democratic, because no single individual has the plan of the ideal, just and united society, nor the GPS for that matter.

It is not only the climate, there is also the need, however, to achieve the so-called ecological 'budget balance'. We know that mankind consumes, in just seven months, the renewable resources that nature is able to regenerate, and not always, over the course of a whole year. If we compare the Earth to an ATM, from August to December 31, mankind makes debt withdrawals, creating an ecological debt that we will bequeath to children and grandchildren. Ecological budget balance is infinitely more important than balancing the budget. In order to achieve a balanced ecological budget, it is therefore necessary to move to a development model based on the circular economy and, in order to avoid climate damage, we need a shift to a society based on renewable energies. But these two transformations are not free, they have an economic cost. We cannot simply dump them on the citizens in the form of taxes on polluting fuels and the like in the name of a balanced budget. The Eu ropean Union and the Member States must be able to spend to finance the ecological transition, which will create jobs through the circular economy and renewable energies.

At the same time, this approach to these two categories means that there is a higher class that is more aware, that is, the managerial class, or perhaps the political class, of rich people, because the citizen usually simply means a citizen, an employee as a worker, that is, from this point of view, I believe that our debate should generally go in this direction.

Inaction is not an option. We owe it to ourselves, our children and the generations to come. We remain committed to involving workers and citizens in order to achieve a just transition. This means an effective transition in terms of emission cuts, as well as increasing renewable energy and energy efficiency. It also means a transition that leaves no region and no citizen behind. This transition is a clear opportunity for Europe to take leadership in innovative, sustainable solutions that will boost our long-term competitiveness and create jobs. It is an opportunity for green growth, which we should capture. However, to be accepted by the public this transition should bring benefits and opportunities to everyone – those in the cities and those in rural areas. We need a transition that is sustainable, in line with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and that provides a cushion and a safety net for those most affected. We should have the courage to acknowledge that this change will come at a cost, a cost which, in the short to medium term, might not be equally distributed between regions, between sectors or, most importantly, between people. That is why, in designing our policy response, social policy considerations should be included from the start in order to limit the deepening of inequalities.

From the point of view of workers, the transformation will profoundly transform the labour market, creating both new risks and opportunities.

The lack of inclusion of workers and citizens in the debate on the transition of the economy towards a low-carbon m.in may result in social m.in, as we are currently seeing in France. It is becoming increasingly clear that poorer citizens are the most burdened by the costs of climate policy.

Mr President, the current situation is a slap in the face to people who want basic justice, namely that everyone pays a fair contribution, including the multinationals and the millionaires. It's a slap in the face to people who want us to contribute to children's schools, care for the elderly, neighborhood safety. The proposal to tax certain turnover of tech giants is a temporary but therefore necessary intervention. It is sometimes the largest companies in the world that pay the least tax: Amazon, Google, Facebook, but also Uber and Airbnb. In addition to the problems they cause, for example the distribution of fake news, they also fail to pay taxes, contribute to the collective provisions of and for everyone.  At the same time, public support for change is overwhelming. 720 000 people have signed avaaz's petition supporting the DigiTax proposal. More than 80% of the inhabitants of countries where governments are opposed, such as Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden, say they support the proposal. The same more than 80% say that we should not wait for an international agreement. We must not give in to American threats. We should not limit the scope of taxes, but rather expand it with Netflix and similar digital content providers.  That is precisely the proposal of the ECON Committee. Netflix also has to pay taxes for its digital sales. In fact, I would like to make a case for increasing the rate from 3% to 5%. Only then will there be a level playing field between the digital company and the traditional large company. Because it is the digital giants that can pretend that they are not present in a country in order to avoid tax. Therefore, increase the rate.  The intervention is therefore necessary, public support is high and yet European countries are in doubt and refusing to reach an agreement. Incomprehensible. In a mutual agreement, France and Germany threaten to undress the proposal. Incomprehensible. Liberals and conservatives want a low rate. Incomprehensible.  The tax on revenue from digital services is temporary. I've already said that. It must be a prelude to a structural solution. A definition of digital presence, so that digital companies will pay income tax where they operate. To this end, the European Parliament has already called for the reports on the common and consolidated income tax. Dariusz Rosati's report is welcome and good, because that confirms that. We must be aware that the current income tax systems are completely dated and are not suitable in a time of globalisation and digitisation. Finally, the road to an international agreement. There is a very lopsided situation.  Currently, Google pays 86% of the income tax in the United States and only 14% elsewhere. So we do not have to count on the United States to come to our aid to rectify this skewed situation. We'll have to do it ourselves. On the contrary, a European initiative is needed to ensure that the American negotiators come to the table. This is precisely what is needed to ensure that the OECD talks actually have a chance of success. This is necessary to prevent each European country from doing its own business and introducing a DigiTax itself. The plans for this are already in the balance, but will only splinter the labour market. In short, a digital tax is needed for basic justice, a level playing field between companies. That can't wait.

This principle that taxes should be paid where the value is created has been a long-established principle in the second half of the 20th century in all developed countries, and it was aimed at reflecting the traditional system of industry where companies were physically present in individual countries, and that was the reason for them to pay taxes. However, the emergence of the digital market and digital services poses important challenges to this traditional model of taxation, because it turns out that digital companies can provide digital services actually with very little or no physical presence in the country of destination. For this reason, the Commission and many experts from the Member States rightly noted that a large part of revenues created by Internet international giants who provide digital services in Europe is simply not taxed.  The report on the Council directive laying down rules relating to the corporate taxation of a significant digital presence is devised as a permanent solution, given the fact that international efforts to establish a global solution for digital taxation being conducted under the auspices of the OECD are not progressing at a satisfactory pace. In this situation, even though we are all – and the European Commission of course as well –interested in developing a common global solution and are prepared to work in the framework of the OECD to achieve such a solution because the prospects for getting this global solution are very slim and this task is difficult (it will take much more time than expected), the EU decided to come up with its own proposal. This proposal is, first of all, focused on the definition of the digital services. These services differ from the traditional provision of services in three important aspects. First of all, these digital businesses are allowed to provide services in the country without any physical presence. Secondly, they rely heavily on intangible assets such as user data. Third, the value in those services is created because of the users’ use of respective digital Internet networks.  So these are the three characteristics that distinguish digital services from the traditional services. As a result, the Commission proposes that, instead of using a physical presence, there should be a definition of a significant digital presence, which is defined in the draft directive by three criteria which are well explained in the document, and on the basis of these three criteria the countries will be able to define the revenues that accrue to that country and these revenues will be taxed as regular corporate taxes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 85, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Juliane Bogner-Strauss", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, I would like to thank everyone for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.  Let me start with digital taxation: I would like to give you a brief overview of the work of the Austrian Presidency, and I would like to summarise the Ecofin Council outcome and the next steps, as we see it. All Member States agreed that the fair taxation of the digital economy is very topical. We also all agreed that, in the long term, this requires a global solution. It becomes more and more evident that global changes in economic models might require a larger overhaul of agreed international tax rules. If we design specific rules targeting only some of the digital business models, we risk not capturing all and not making the rules future—proof. International rules have to be adapted and this has to be done – preferably in an orderly way – by reaching international agreements with a wide scope, both in terms of ambition and in terms of the number of economies adhering thereto. There are discussions currently ongoing at the level of G20 and the OECD. The European Union is actively contributing to these discussions. The G20 has set the OECD the deadline of 2020. I believe this is a realistic deadline, and the OECD should be given a fair chance to negotiate and implement revisions to the international tax framework by that date. Keeping in mind the wider global context, it is our firm belief that, when it comes to interim levies, a common EU approach is preferable to unilateral national measures. Until now, 11 Member States have announced that they have, or shortly will have, a national digital service tax in place. We are convinced that, if we do not reach agreement on the EU interim measure, even more Member States might consider taking this path. We could see a proliferation of different national taxes with different rates and scopes. This could lead to the fragmentation of the Single Market and could harm the competitiveness and growth of the EU economy. In this context, the Austrian Presidency devoted considerable efforts to the Digital Service Tax Directive. All technical and legal aspects of the proposal were examined in great detail. Numerous meetings took place at technical, as well as at political levels – most notably at Ecofin Council meetings on 6 November and 4 December 2018. For the meeting of the Ecofin Council last week, we prepared the compromise text, which had the broad support of Member States. In our view, that compromise was balanced and legally sound, representing elements with the most support. Unfortunately, before the Ecofin meeting, we could see that we would not have unanimity on the text. During the meeting, two delegations – Germany and France – in an effort to constructively contribute to the discussions, suggested that we should continue discussing the directive, but with a narrower scope. We have not yet had in—depth discussions of this new suggestion, since delegations need to study it in their capitals. However, many delegations confirmed their willingness to discuss it. Therefore, as the Presidency, we will try to take discussions forward on that basis. The incoming Romanian Presidency is closely associated with these discussions and will be ready to seamlessly take over as from 1 January 2019. Last but not least, on the topic of digital taxation, I would also like to thank the honourable rapporteurs, Mr Tang and Mr Rosati, for their work on this and we welcome the fact that you will very soon adopt the two reports. On the second topic that you have proposed to discuss today – the need for a majority rule for taxation – I can be very brief. As the Treaties currently stand, taxation is subject to unanimity. I am aware of the passerelle clause in the Treaty on European Union. Should there be such an initiative on the table, it would be examined in accordance with the procedure foreseen by the Treaties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 86, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Mr. The Commission. Mr President, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. It is my task to represent my colleague Mr Moscovici, who is due to meet the Prime Minister of Italy in Brussels this afternoon for the current occasion. I would like to thank, with great respect, the two rapporteurs, Mr Tang and Mr Rosati, for two competent and, I believe, comprehensive reports which facilitate the work at European level also for the Commission and with which I can largely agree. That is why the Commission presented an initiative to this end in March this year. We are convinced that, in the digital age, the corporate taxation procedure in the Member States is no longer completely up-to-date in the European and world. In the analogue age, decomposition works very, very well for products and services, and thus also the fair allocation of sales, revenues and thus possible taxes. But in the case of digital services, this is increasingly difficult to do if there is no physical presence and when data derived from Europeans and European events leads to sales and revenues, but then also taxes outside Europe. This development will intensify. The share of global GDP through digital services and big data is increasing. There is therefore a need to analyse the situation and also to act to ensure the fairness of taxation and the stabilisation of revenue for public funds. We have therefore made two proposals to ensure fair and efficient taxation. I would like to start by saying that we are prepared to optimise and develop our proposals. We have made a mark-up and are always able to work flexibly on further development with the aim of reaching an agreement. One is the reform of the corporate tax rules in order to secure adequate profit shares and share of turnover for Europe. And it is a provisional tax – a provisional one – targeting the main digital activities that are currently missing out on an increasing volume of sales in Europe. I am pleased to see that Here and on other issues, Parliament and the Commission are allies. I would also like to thank the Presidency of the Council for a dedicated moderation of the debate in the Council, which I believe can be effective. The two reports , as I have mentioned, show a high degree of competence and broadly support the Commission's proposals. By deciding on these two reports here tomorrow, you are sending a clear signal to even more hesitant Member States to speed up the debate in the Council as well. We think that the Franco-German initiative can be helpful here. Paris and Berlin have proposed to limit the scope to advertising revenue in order to reach an agreement here by spring next year, with the aim of bringing a corresponding digital tax into force on 1 January 2021, but to do everything possible in time to reach international solutions at OECD-plus level. The digital tax, if there is no solution at international level, would come into force in January 2021 and would expire in 2025. The likelihood of an OECD agreement is to be left out, but since the US is a major OECD partner and has so far disproportionately participated in sales and revenues, I do not think a solution at this level is very likely. The other argument that needs to be seen is that the trade dispute with the United States, which we want to avoid and have so far avoided, could become a little more likely. We will have to weigh this up in the coming months. The Paris and Berlin proposals are not quite as ambitious as those of the Commission, but a chance to reach an agreement. We have agreed that the tax should be temporary. We agree that the optimal solution should be structural and global – hence the OECD level as the next level of discussion. And we must agree that the absence of an agreement would lead to a disorderly approach, with 10, 11 or 12 or more national solutions. This would be a fragmentation of the European, especially the European Digital Single Market. The digital tax dossier shows once again that it is extremely difficult to resolve tax problems within the framework of the unanimity principle. That is why, at the beginning of next year, as announced by President Juncker, we will propose to this House, in the State of the Union address, the decision-making process for a qualified majority in the tax field. This would enable us to act, and we could also be able to act more quickly and with a high probability of results are coming. Examples where the majority principle would be useful are the proposed common consolidated corporate tax base, the reform of VAT law to create a single VAT area and the reform of digital taxation. A transition to qualified majority voting would also broaden the scope of tax policy in Europe. We believe that taxation can help to achieve general policy objectives – in environmental protection or in the field of energy policy, in the rural sector, and financial transaction tax, energy taxes or climate taxes are examples of this. It would also be democratic progress. In a Union of 28 or 27, unanimity is not really practicable; it has become cumbersome and counterproductive. That is why we are asking the House to respond with benevolent interest to our proposal at the beginning of next year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 87, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, the design of a stable and modern fiscal framework is essential to open up digital opportunities for individuals and businesses in a market of more than 500 million consumers, that of the European Union. The objective we wanted to defend in this report is for each company to pay its dues and, moreover, where it belongs. What we can in no way allow is for digital companies to pay on average less than half the corporation tax than traditional companies. This is an injustice to our SMEs and it is an injustice to all citizens.  The proposal put to us by the Commission , which we support , imposed a 3% tax on the revenues of large technology companies, with the aim of establishing rules of fair play between the digital sector and the traditional sector. We reached good agreement in the Committee on Economic and Economic Affairs, with a series of commitments to keep the tax at 3%, while extending the scope so that more companies in the digital sector would be subject to this tax.  But once again, the Socialist Group is again in breach of its agreements and, unfortunately, has decided to break the compromise we made just over a week ago at the last meeting of shadow rapporteurs. He's worth his word and believe me, I'm sorry.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which This proposal is a bad proposal, and it is ill-conceived and does not get any better by the fact that the Social Democrats, in particular, are arguing here with very strong populist prejudices, which can all be refuted if you think about it in more detail. Each of us is in favour of a fair and fair tax regime, and each of us is against tax evasion and tax avoidance. But we must first of all state that tax evasion and tax avoidance are, of course, a much more important phenomenon than limited to the digital economy. In other words, a digital tax is certainly not the right instrument to combat tax evasion and tax avoidance. We have other instruments for this, and we should use them to do so. However, the question also arises as to whether the starting point that taxation is currently unfair is correct at all. After all, what is taxed for? After all, it is taxed for companies to use a country's infrastructure – a country's public services. If digital companies do not have a physical presence in a country, one has to ask the question: is it not natural that they use less public infrastructure than companies with a physical presence?  Is there really a distortion here, an unfairness, as everyone in this House is so recklessly talking about? In any event, the Commission has failed to prove that there is unfairness. She did not say how we should measure fairness in this case at all. What is being proposed is something that would be very complicated, very expensive and very bureaucratic. And it is not clear that we are improving in any way. In fact, the profits from digital activity are, of course, taxed, but perhaps not at company level, but only after distribution to shareholders. But taxation is, of course, taking place within the framework of personal income taxation.  It must therefore be said that this is actually a distribution albattle.

There were two proposals on digital taxation, which were overwhelmingly supported by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs last Monday. The first proposal for a digital service tax, which is meant as an interim measure, will ensure that the revenues generated by user activity on certain digital services are taxed in a fair, efficient and transparent way before a comprehensive solution can be reached. The second proposal offers the comprehensive solution to reform corporate tax rules, so that profits are registered and taxed where businesses have significant interaction with users through digital channels. It is, therefore, hard to believe that the Council was unable to reach an agreement and has been watering down the proposals, including the scope, and has postponed the decision. The Council Presidency spectacularly failed. We can also see that it is mainly those Member States who benefit from profit-shifting schemes which are the ones who are against these proposals. In this area the European Union is clearly paralysed and will regret it dearly.

Objective number one: to reach an international agreement, but not only on the next two years, but within the next two years. In order to build pressure on this and to have our own solution in case there is no agreement at world level, we have made our proposal and we are working to get it adopted unanimously.

My colleague Mr Moscovici will do everything possible to reach an amicable solution here with all the Member States in the coming weeks. Thirdly, the principle of unanimity is a general problem.

First, there is a lot of misunderstanding in this debate because we have two different proposals on the table – two completely different Commission proposals and some of the speakers have completely mixed them up and discussed them as one. This is not the proper approach.  Second, to all those who question the rationale behind the need to tax digital companies, let me give you just one example. Google representatives admitted at the hearing before the TAX 3 Committee that they pay tax, profit tax, corporate profit tax in the US to the amount of USD 6.5 billion, and for the same number of users in Europe they pay only USD 200 million a year. That means they pay USD 32 per user in the US and USD 0.4 but user in Europe. This is, of course, a question of fairness. Why should Europe give up such a large proportion of the tax due here? On the point as to whether we should go ahead of the OECD, I see no conflict between us working on a solution – a permanent solution – and the OECD making some progress. Of course, if there is a global solution, we are going to wind up our proposal. There is no question about that; we have to remember that.  And finally, let me tell you that this is not against American companies. This is only because the American companies are definitely on top of all digital companies. They are on the top because they make most of their profits outside the US, which is not taxed. That’s why they are so heavily capitalised. We want to restore elementary fairness and transparency in the taxing system and this is our main goal.

Given the nature of digital activity, where value is being added, costs assumed and profits made constitute matters lacking the clarity found in other economic activities. This makes it possible for GAFA and others to fudge their income statements and avoid having so as to pay taxes on their profits. In these circumstances it is legitimate to introduce a tax on their sales, where these occur, to curtail and eliminate such tax avoidance.  While this report supports the introduction of such a tax, it does so as part of a strategy by which, on a European scale, we move towards a harmonisation of taxation, not least by putting in place the tools that would make such harmonisation easily possible.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The debate gives the Commission an opportunity to inform you of the state of play that interests you are about possible abuse of European programmes in a Member State and a possible conflict of interest here. We are taking a comprehensive and unbiased approach to the matter. Let me briefly briefly present the various periods: the most important current period is that of 2 August this year. Since then, the new Financial Regulation adopted by this House and the Council and the new Article 61, which has strengthened, or could say, strengthened the definition of a conflict of interest have been strengthened. It concerns the direct, indirect and shared management of European budgetary resources.  As far as this period, since 2 August, is concerned, we have made clear to the government and the head of government of the country concerned our legal opinion, touching article 61 of conflicts of interest, by writing to the government and the head of government. We have received an initial reply and will now evaluate it further. Importantly, during the period of the new Financial Regulation, no European funds have been disbursed to the Member State concerned and/or to projects in the Member State concerned. In other words, since 2 August we have not seen any budgetary relevance in the implementation of the 2018 budget. We have also made it clear in a letter that, until the legal situation is satisfactory from our point of view and the conflict of interest has not been resolved, we have no intention of elaborating. Secondly, in our letter, we also made it clear whether and, if necessary, the obligation of the person concerned to remedy and resolve the conflict of interest can be complied with.  A conflict of interest under the Financial Regulation means that that person concerned must refrain from any act which may conflict with those of the Union of his or her own interests. The person must take appropriate measures to prevent a conflict of interest from arising with regard to the tasks falling within his or her remit and measures must be taken to remedy situations that could objectively be perceived as a conflict of interest. The new rules will also apply in the case of shared management, and they are, first and all, a matter for the national authorities. According to the Financial Regulation, their task is to establish, maintain and take measures to prevent conflicts of interest. This obligation concerns the Member States as a whole. We have therefore also taken measures to inform you accordingly, to give you advice, and we are monitoring the measures that are and have been taken.  It is also clear, however, that this is not just a matter for the national authorities, but the Commission – our services – is responsible for protecting the Financial Interests of the European Union and therefore also has the power to take appropriate action in this area. This is done in the Commission by the Directorates-General REGIO, AGRI, Employment in contact with the Legal Service and the General Secretariat, as well as DG Budget, the authority that is my responsibility. We have received a number of official complaints for the period since 2 August, including from a Czech parliamentarian, Transparency International, and the Prime Minister concerned also addressed the matter in a letter to us. We will fully clarify the issue with the aim of resolving conflicts of interest and not making any payment from the 2018 or 2019 budgets by then. The second period is that before 2 August, which I would like to divide into the time when people concerned were not yet members of the government, and the time when they were ministers in government or were also prime ministers. We divide these periods very precisely. We have arranged through our services for a comprehensive audit to be carried out, which our officials will also carry out on the ground on several working days in January.  What is it about, if you look at the volumes, if you take into account the two budget periods 2007 to 2013 on the one hand and 2014 to 2 August 2018 on the other? We are talking about several programmes, we are talking about the second pillar of our agricultural policy, we are talking about the ERDF in our coalition policy, and it is about the ESF, the European social policy, to the smallest extent. AGRI – our Rural Development Programme – when adding both periods, involves 115 projects with a total volume of European funds, i.e. our co-financing size, of total of EUR 12.4 million in both budget periods. These are 115 projects for which we have co-financed. A further 26 projects have been approved, but not yet paid. If you look at the projects co-financed from erDF – regional policy – and from employment, from ESF, a total of 76 projects with 44.3 million – added – total payments from the European budget are involved in the 2007-2013 budget period.  For the current budget period 2014 to 2020, again REGIO and Employment, there are 26 projects with a total volume of currently just under 3 million euros.  As I said, for the period after 2 August, we will work to ensure that, in our legal opinion, the conflict of interest is eliminated, avoided and no payments are made until then. We will review the entire period – from 2007 to the end of 2013 and from 2014 to August 2018 – through comprehensive audits by the above-mentioned Directorates-General in January, and then provide you with a comprehensive progress report and an overall assessment. We have overseen my letter to the Prime Minister at the end of November, Mrs Gräßle and Mrs Ayala Sender, and we are also happy to forward it, within the limits of the agreed confidentiality, to all other ordinary and deputy members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, if desired. We would like to draw attention to the necessary confidentiality, which has been agreed.

Thank you very much, Commissioner, we are happy to accept all these text announcements. I have not yet made the letter available to colleagues because we were expecting a response from the Commission. Therefore, the letter can of course be viewed from afterwards under the agreed confidentiality conditions. This is an item on the agenda on which we must show our colours. I would like to say that, in budgetary control, we are following developments in the Czech Republic with growing concern. We have been dealing with this conflict of interest since 2014 and have already put down resolutions here on several occasions, and have written passages in the respective discharge reports. It's time for something to happen. That is why, Commissioner, thank you very much for taking up this matter and for letting clear words follow. We can see that we now have a payment to the companies of the former Finance Minister and Prime Minister. These payments increased from EUR 42 million to EUR 82 million. There is a saying in Germany, a beautiful song: the boy sat at the source. The Finance Minister was head of the audit authority for EU funds and has been shown to have interfered in the work of these authorities. The Prime Minister now chairs the Structural Funds project body and is thus sitting at the source himself. In my Member State, we would also have a criminal assessment for this: it would be infidelity. That is why the Czech authorities really must ensure that they do the work that all of us, the whole of Europe, expects of them. It would be very important for us to follow the financial side, but the Czech authorities should also pursue the criminal aspect. I have a very good impression of the state of the Czech authorities and also of the Czech press. We have seen for three years – Commissioner, I have told you – a rather lacklustre European Commission. However, we are now pleased that the current last amendment to the Financial Regulation really does lead to something. And, Madam President-in-Office of the Council, it would be up to you to take this debate forward in the Council as well. I know it is a difficult dossier. However, precisely because the credibility of the whole of the European Union is at stake here, you are called upon to take action. We welcome the study by the Legal Service and your letter, Commissioner, to the Czech Prime Minister. But we are also calling for action now. And the deed is this: no more money to Agrofert as long as this construction continues, where, firstly, equal opportunities are massively damaged, secondly, competition is undermined, thirdly, self-service is operated on EU taxpayers' money and, fourthly, the suspicion of tax evasion and infidelity that hovers above everything has not been dispelled. I am also talking about the tax-free crown bonds of 2011 and 2012. What shocks me is the way we are danced around on our noses. There have been many lies. Yes, I met the Prime Minister as Finance Minister at the time, and I believed him. And that was a mistake, because then we also stopped the work over a very long time. But he has announced and delivered nothing of what he promised. And now, I fear, it will be the same again. I am disappointed with the ALDE Group. Mr Verhofstadt stands here and rails with a big bohei against Hungary, and rightly against Hungary. But I would have expected Mr Verhofstadt to sit down here and call his friend, his Czech friend, to order. We expect something to happen here – not out of partisan activity, but because it is a question of the hygiene of this House.  (Applause) We meet the whole world with our index finger raised. The rule of law is important to us, and the rule of law is a test, especially in the Czech Republic. Something has to happen here!

You each time you say to me, \"I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it.\" But the thing is, he doesn't.

Not to mention emblematic companies such as Volkswagen, also with some conflict of interest and with European funds and aids.

I apologize in advance to the interpreters that some deadlines may be difficult for them to translate.  First of all, I would like to say that we, opposition Members from opposition parties, have not brought this issue to the European Parliament. It was brought in by a group that does not even have any Czech members, and I think that this is clear evidence that this is not a reflection of the Czech internal political struggle, but that there is indeed a suspicion of a conflict of interest on European soil concerning the use of funds from the European budget. Unfortunately, it resonates from the highest places, that is, mainly from the place of prime minister of the Czech Republic. What's going on? The Prime Minister was one of the key economic players, he managed a large group that had a significant position on the Czech market in terms of agricultural production, food industry, chemical production, and this group was also a big beneficiary of subsidies from the European budget and these were really gigantic amounts. Although the Prime Minister, formerly as Finance Minister, has formally and legally cut himself off from this business in the form of a trust fund, it does have close associates, family members, so there are some doubts as to whether he is continuing to influence this concern. Of course, as Commissioner Oettinger said, there are also stricter rules that have been in place since 2 August this year, and therefore the matter needs to be properly investigated. If I can appeal from this place to supporters or voters or the Prime Minister's fan club, it's really not a campaign at the moment, it's not a purpose-based one, it's not a conspiracy. The point is simply that it is necessary to investigate whether someone is playing \"small houses\" here, or rather in this case a \"big home\". I think that you, too, the voters and supporters of the Prime Minister, should be interested in the economic side of things, because there was a time when politicians in the Czech Republic resigned on far less suspicion. The second thing that needs to be addressed is the subsidy system at all. What is the purpose of subsidies, whether cohesive policies or the common agricultural policy? It's economic convergence. If we have countries that have 130% of gross domestic product per capita, and at the other end of the country that are below 50%, then we have to try to compare them a little with those European policies. I am afraid that if the system is set up in such a way that large groups, such as Agrofert, can be the beneficiaries of European subsidies, then we will never achieve this goal. This is therefore an appeal to the Commission to think a little about the way subsidies are allocated in preparation for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the next period and to think more about SMEs, small and medium-sized enterprises.  I'm not happy that we're discussing the Czech Republic here. I am of the opinion that dirty laundry should be washed at home, but on the other hand, the whole issue concerns European money, so the European Parliament is the place where we have to talk about it and we have to.

The Commission is in communication with one of the Member States, examining a potential conflict of interests which involves the Prime Minister and concerns the use of EU Structural Funds. I do believe that in such a situation it is critically important that we carefully look at the facts at hand. The Commission’s legal analysis concludes that the Prime Minister, Mr Andrej Babiš, is in a situation which occurred and may objectively be perceived as a conflict of interests. This is based on the financial regulation that applies since August this year. Commissioner Oettinger, when questioned by the Committee on Budgetary Control, made it clear that it is now up to the Czech authorities to address the situation, based on written guidance from the Commission. From the perspective of my Group, it is important that solutions are swiftly found and systemic measures taken so that the situation is brought fully into line with EU legislation. We have a first written reply from the Czech government that signals that the authorities, and the Prime Minister personally, are aware of the gravity of the situation and conducting an analysis. This analysis should obviously be followed by the necessary steps to solve the situation. It is now up to the Czech authorities to do so and to take measures to remove all concerns and doubts. To my EPP and Green colleagues, I would like to ask you not to fall too quickly into the trap of painting all the European countries with the same brush.

Often it is people who find it difficult to make ends meet.  That is why reports of conflicts of interest or fraud are getting extra hard. We are right to make tougher demands for respect for the rule of law when european funds are spent. We want the public to be able to trust that their money is being spent properly. In the case of the Czech Republic, irregularities have previously been detected in connection with the Stork's Nest case. And now there are renewed indications that there could be a conflict of interest and that the Czech Prime Minister is personally benefiting from EU funds.  No one is guilty until proven guilty, but we must be confident that investigations are taking place both in the Czech Republic itself and through OLAF which are independent and thorough. We have a right to have Parliament well informed. I would ask the Commission and the Council to do so.  Finally, one general call to the Commission. After 2015, no anti-corruption report on the Member States and on the European institutions has been published.

Citizens do not want their political leaders to see the European Union as an ATM machine, as an ATM where money can be taken away, where business and political friends can be enriched.

An audit is one thing. Once that audit is in January, what's the timing? How will you act quickly? How will you ensure that action is indeed taken and will it continue before the 2019 elections?

I find it very unfair for the Commissioner here to say that the Czech authorities have to deal with this matter.

This means that he cannot now blame the situation on the Czech authorities. The European Union is guilty and the European Union must resolve this. If we are to look at how subsidies are granted and how they are managed in the European Union, I would like to recall that years ago a group of Members dealt with the management of the European Union and concluded that around EUR 5 billion is lost annually in the European budget without a trace, without any accounting records, without any information on what happened to the money.

Mr President, the Czech Prime Minister, Andrej Babia, is accused of a conflict of interest by the European Union. Owner of a group of companies specialising in agri-food, chemicals and media, he is said to have paid his companies around 100 million euros in European funds allocated to the Czech Republic. This charge is very suspicious. I have several reasons to believe that it is driven by a desire for political persecution. A shrewd businessman, Mr. Babio knows the world of finance and business, which is why he is well placed to describe the euro as a bankrupt currency. This assessment is all the more a sham for the European Union as it leads to the Czech Republic's refusal to join the euro area. Even more serious in the eyes of the Brussels Commission, on 27 June 2018, Mr Babio made the fight against illegal migration the priority of his government. To President Macron, who blamed him, he replied this, and I quote: \"No one will dictate to us who will live and work with us.\" As we know, for Jean-Claude Juncker, Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron, denying immigration is an unforgivable sin. As if all this were not enough, Mr. Babio finally has the audacity to define himself as a populist. The international press also calls him the Czech Trump and his party, which is called \"The Action of Disgruntled Citizens\", evokes a desire to revolt against the pseudo-elite that irresistibly reminds us of the French yellow vest movement. It is for all these reasons that I accuse the European Union of trying to persecute Mr Babio and the Czech Republic. Instead of trying to lecture the whole world, the Union should instead question its own practices and ask itself, for example, why it put at the head of the Brussels Commission, a man, Jean-Claude Juncker, who illegally deprived several European states of billions of euros of tax revenue for the benefit of his country, Luxembourg.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 140, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Stanislav POLČÁK", "mepid": "124704", "text": "   – Mr President, conflicts of interest are one of the most serious systemic defects in financial operations within the budget.

Then something really doesn't add up. I dare say that such a huge conflict of interest with the Prime Minister of a Member State of the European Union has not yet known this level of ours.  This is not a matter of questionable interpretation of the regulation, as the Czech Prime Minister is trying to excuse. The interpretation is fairly clear. If it draws European subsidies, it must comply with European rules, which really hit each of us. We Members must insist on compliance with the established rules, the Guardian of these rules is the Commission. It is primarily the Member States that have responsibility for carrying out the checks, but the Czech Republic is failing completely in this control.

The European Commission always stresses that it is following the set rules, and its conclusions certainly cannot be expected before all the facts are verified. If we do not have complete information in the Committee on Budgetary Control, how can we adopt a resolution in plenary on this matter? Why don't we let the institutions work?

Mr Babiš became Minister of Finance already in 2014 at the time when he already owned Agrofert.  Agrofert is today the biggest receiver of EU subsidies in the Czech Republic and operates in several other EU countries. There are still some uncertainties about the relation of Mr Babiš towards the Czech legislation on conflict of interest, so the reasons to adopt new European financial regulations are clear: to definitely avoid these types of conflict of interests.  Today, thanks to the Czech Pirate Party, who was the first to notify the Commission, there is no doubt that Czech Prime Minister Babiš and Czech Minister of Agriculture Toman are seriously violating the Financial Regulation. National authorities of Member States are obliged to secure preparatory measures, audit and control of financial resources from the EU budget, but we can’t expect the authorities in the Czech Republic to be able to properly comply with such rules in a situation where both the Prime Minister and the Agriculture Minister have confirmed relations to companies drawing agricultural subsidies. This is why I call upon you to take swift and strict measures to control the flow of EU financial resources to the Czech Republic and to implement the necessary corrective measures to end this illegal conduct.  Such shameful conflict of interests of executive powers, who will actually participate in the European Council this week, have to be solved urgently in order to avoid further damage to the Czech Republic and to its people, as well as to the European Union.

You soak up billions of pounds— or euros—worth of taxpayers’ money into the centre, you then take that money and, politically motivated, redirect it into projects in countries you think it should be redistributed to. You then find out – because there’s such a huge amount, and it always would be the case with such a huge state, with such huge money – that sometimes it goes in directions you don’t like. Sometimes, it breaks the rules. On this occasion, apparently, allegedly, it would appear the Czech Prime Minister has been using it in a somewhat dubious way. All of this is then judged from this esteemed senate building and looked on. You decide what to do to the Czechs. You have a super—powered Commissioner, a powerful accountant, a real Superman of accountants, who’s going to rip open a nation state’s books to check through them. Having been in small business myself, this is a little bit like having the auditors turn up. It’s very frightening, I can assure you. Well you are doing that on a grand scale.  It boggles the mind as to what might happen, for example, if we had a ‘remain’ UK. What would happen? Would we one day have Theresa May’s successor dragged in front of the super—accountant who says ‘you’ve not spent the money the way we think you should’ – although most of the money actually goes the other way. It’s nightmarish to think a nation state could be in this situation, and to think that a supranational governance like you could throw money like this – millions upon millions – into something that you then afterwards realise might well be going to friends and family and being completely misused.  Then the whole point: conflict of interest. Well, I understand it in business terms but I can give you some more conflicts of interest that EU money is often used in, and it doesn’t get investigated. What about the conflict of interest of the EU funding of the BBC, who then publicised propaganda on behalf of the EU during the Brexit campaign and discussion and continued to do it? Surely that’s a conflict of interest. What about the conflict of interest of British political figures who’ve made money, employed legally, working within the Commission and other things? People like the Kinnocks, Lord Mandelson, who then engage in British debate about whether or not we stay in the EU? This is about what you think is a conflict of interest and what isn’t. If you can pay someone and you allow them to go forward to spread your propaganda, you think that’s okay. But if you’re paying someone randomly millions like this and then they do things with it in a way that most likely does seem unethical, you then want to clamp down with super—accountant. It is hypocrisy.  The truth is that when you have such a massive amount of money slushing around, even the greatest of organisations – which maybe this might one day be – cannot possibly run it effectively, efficiently without corruption. You can’t even get your own accounts signed off. So how can you then come down like this when you’re throwing money around at a government that may be corrupt?

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I am grateful for this intensive debate, which shows me how seriously Members from various positions take the matter and thus also have a high expectation of the Commission – for me, for my colleagues and for the Commission's services. I want to continue to meet this high expectation comprehensively in the coming weeks. We were asked why the anti-corruption report is no longer being presented. Freedom from corruption is an important factor in the state of administrations, governments and Member States. That is why we have made anti-corruption and the fight against corruption our own section in the European Semester and want to expand this further there. The rule of law, freedom of corruption, quality of administration in general are factors that should play an important role in country specific recommendations and before that in the semester. You will find out how we assess the state of corruption in the Member States, Member State by Member State. Secondly, it is, of course, a joint responsibility of the Commission. But Let me point out that our possibilities are limited in the operational business. Unlike national governments, we have no underpout. Our support for budget implementation is the Member States, the regions, their authorities, and this is all the more true when resources are shared. In other words, we take special action when we have reasons, suspicions, indications that things are not right. As a rule, we assume an orderly administration, a performance of tasks on the basis of European national law.  I would like to point out that Article 36 and Article 63(4) of the financial regulations state exactly that. I can read this here in English: [...] applied to shared management requiring Member State authorities to put in place effective internal control including the avoidance of conflicts of interest. In other words, it is a primary responsibility of the Member States, the regions, their administrations, and we are responsible when we have reason to be suspicious. That is why, because of this mistrust and the complaints, I now see every reason for the Commission to dig in– I will say so. That is what we are doing. I was asked: when will the audits take place? The Directorate-General for Employment will be in Prague from 8 to 11 January with a team of experts, DG AGRI from 14 to 18 January, DG REGIO from 28 January to 1 February and from 11 to 15 February. I then expect our services, after having full access to all the necessary documents, to report in Brussels to me and my colleagues.  And I can promise on the basis of the relevant question – Bart Staes asked this: I want to give this Parliament a comprehensive report by mid-April at the latest, that is, before the last plenary session here in Strasbourg, which you can then use for a debate and evaluation and commentary, if necessary. The Storchennest case has been raised. This was a project – I believe 1.8 million co-financing was requested. Following olaf investigations, the Czech Government withdrew the co-financing. My final point is that I want to do everything I can to ensure that my person, my colleagues and our authorities are extremely objective and do not engage in any form of domestic issues or even different positions, but that they try to win the trust of all Members from this country, but not only from this country but from the whole House. Thank you very much for today. In the new year, I am happy to answer your questions bilaterally, perhaps to respond to them again during the discharge, but, as I said, to report fully to this Parliament before mid-April.

This is an extremely important issue in the context of the various problems that arise during this interdependence and cross-border interaction. Why is it important to prepare an appropriate legal instrument at Community level? The differences between national legal systems and the resulting intricacies, particularly when disputes arise between counterparties, mean that such processes can take up to years. It is therefore important to give EU businesses the opportunity to resolve these disputes more easily and equally safely. A few years ago, the Committee on Legal Affairs launched this initiative to prepare European sales law, which had great potential in this context to help EU entrepreneurs. Unfortunately, this proposal was not welcomed by the Member States and the work was frozen for several years. However, we have made another effort to tackle these problems, particularly in the context of the changes taking place in the European Union in our market, especially in the context of the changes that will take place after Brexit.  In my report, which I am submitting to the House, I ask the European Commission to consider and prepare a legislative proposal for a new instrument in the form of a European accelerated civil procedure. The idea is that these disputes between traders can be conducted more easily and in a cheaper way. This procedure is modelled on the existing and introduced small dispute procedure. However, this amounts to eur 5 000, while the one we are proposing would go beyond that amount of EUR 5 000 and introduce the possibility of resolving disputes more speedily. What would this higher speed be? The fact that that procedure could be carried out in part at least in writing, that procedural action, in particular the hearing of parties or witnesses, could be introduced by the courts using the latest technology, that is to say, without having to go to the place where the case is conducted. Of course, we are not changing substantive law here in any way, then the cases would be conducted by the national court of the State competent to pursue the case. The small claims procedure has also been designed to enable European entrepreneurs to make a choice. This is a voluntary procedure. The parties could agree to it at the time when the dispute would arise, of course it can only be implemented if all the parties to the dispute agree to such a procedure. Of course, we know perfectly well that the key to doing business is its predictability, its security, thus legal certainty, and therefore we are turning to the European Commission, but also to the Member States, to consider making some kind of change.  It is for the European Commission, in particular, to consider whether it would be appropriate to make changes to the provisions of The Rome I, Rome II and Brussels I Regulations, on the basis of which disputes are currently taking place. It is also up to the European Commission, the Member States, to ask and ask them to consider some kind of action that would be complementary to this legal procedure, because the accelerated dispute resolution instrument alone would obviously not be sufficient.  The point is that the Member States should consider the establishment of chambers or commercial divisions in their courts, since the conduct of such cases by specialised judges, firstly, speeds up the procedure, improves the quality of the decisions delivered. It would also be a matter of involved in the continuous training of judges and lawyers in the field of commercial law. Focus on education in the areas of international law, private law and commercial law, but also on increasing funding for academic research on these issues. Consideration should also be given to member states reviewing the current procedures for commercial disputes. I hope that the European Commission will fully consider this proposal, which we are putting forward in the report on which we are currently starting discussions. I am, of course, open to all kinds of comments leading to an even greater and better improvement in the functioning of European companies in the single market.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 168, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zwiefka, and the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) for their commitment to an efficient system for commercial litigation in the EU and for their work on this legislative initiative report. Indeed, there are a number of ideas which the Commission will consider and which we shall use in our future work because I can confirm today that the Commission shares the same objective.  Efficient and high-quality justice is an important pillar of the European Union. It is an indispensable element of a business-friendly environment which enables prosperity and jobs in the internal market.  In our work, in the justice scoreboard, data shows important differences in the length of court procedures between the Member States, and there is room to stimulate improvements. We share the view that well designed court procedures are one of the key factors of efficient justice. This is why we propose to modernise the rules on cross-border cooperation in taking of evidence and serving of documents which – once adopted – will shorten court proceedings and reduce their costs. I thank the JURI Committee for taking up these files and look forward to the first reading position of Parliament. We will look diligently at the proposals contained in the report. The recommendations contained in your report concern a number of actions, both legislative and non-legislative. Some of them seem to be designed for a longer—term perspective, like the creation of the EU commercial court. We will examine thoroughly their feasibility.  We certainly concur with this report which highlights the importance of judicial training. The future Justice Programme will continue to support the training of the judiciary and judicial staff as a tool to improve judicial cooperation in the EU and a specific objective of the programme will be dedicated to this. This will contribute to the building of the European area of justice by creating a common judiciary culture among justice professionals of the Member States. This is also important to ensure the correct and coherent application of law in the Union and mutual trust between justice professionals in cross-border proceedings.  Overall, I would like to stress that in commercial matters we need to hear the opinions of stakeholders who will be potentially directly affected by the proposed measures. Support, and even demand, from the part of businesses is necessary for success of the proposed measures.  Although we have achieved a lot in our work to strengthen commercial procedures in the EU, there is – as I said before – room for improvement. At the conference on the effectiveness of justice systems organised by the Presidency in Vienna two weeks ago, I stressed the need to improve access to justice, to modernise justice and thus to increase the trust of people in the justice systems. Ideas were put forward about how we can use digitalisation for the benefit of faster procedures and in the interests of both legal practitioners and citizens when claiming remedies.  I believe that the Commission’s work on effective justice systems, particularly on the EU justice scoreboard and the monitoring through the European semester, will help us to achieve these goals.

I am pleased with it, among other things, that this is not about any effort to regulate from above, but, on the contrary, it is about responding to demands from below, and i therefore believe that this proposal, if implemented, will show other European citizens the added value of European integration. If we create a European accelerated procedure for cross-border trade disputes, we will speed them up and thus respond to the basic complaint that entrepreneurs have. We want the solution to be faster and therefore cheaper. We want this procedure to be based on the principle of thorough pre-trial preparation of the parties, so that it takes place primarily in writing, so that the procedural time limits are as short as possible.

The reasons why we have dealt with this issue are known to all those present here. The settlement of trade disputes in the European Union is still too slow, it needs to be speeded up and it needs to be based on the harmonisation of a matter, that of cooperation, for which civil measures are still very far apart in European countries. An accelerated civil measure for Europe has undoubted advantages: it not only removes the elements of conflict and potential conflict, but also becomes an opportunity for great resource savings, which companies can then use and reinvest in their own interests and in the interests of the people with whom they have a relationship, of all stakeholdes, starting with those who work in these companies. We are therefore talking about a procedure, as we know, which should only apply to disputes relating to relations between undertakings, that is to say, all those which have no consequences or aspects linked to the rights or conditions of other undertakings or workers. What is fundamental to us is that any procedure for the accelerated resolution of trade disputes established at European level ensures full respect for the rights of the parties, including the possibility, subsequently, of being able to activate a judicial process. We have defined that the character will be exclusively voluntary as far as the procedure is concerned and, therefore, we need the consent of both contractors. The choice of a procedure cannot be allowed before any dispute begins: this is important for contractual clauses or in commercial agreements between undertakings, because there would be a risk that one of the parties could influence the others by its decision, and the party influencing it is necessarily and objectively always the strongest, to the detriment of small businesses. We must therefore ensure that the solution we are proposing does not contain any risk of penalising the weakest in trade relations. This element is justice, it is democracy, and we are particularly committed to this, as we have shown with the proposals we have made and with the nature of the debate we have had.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 171, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Jiří MAŠTÁLKA", "mepid": "23704", "text": "  on the part of the GUE/NGL Group. – Mr President, let me first thank my friend and rapporteur, Tadeusz Zwiefka, for preparing this report, which I think is very good. It is no secret that the resolution of trade disputes in the European Union is still unmissably slow. It is estimated that clients in some Member States wait up to four years to enforce the terms of a commercial contract. In particular, it is the speed and efficiency that clients most desire from the court when resolving commercial disputes. Although it must be acknowledged that, according to the comparison issued by the Commission each year, some progress is being made in the length of civil proceedings. On a number of measures proposed by the rapporteur, I would immediately sign off on the report as such. Training lawyers and judges in commercial matters, greater access to EU and national legislation, as well as the idea of introducing a European accelerated civil procedure, are all topics for discussion. I am somewhat sceptical about the idea of establishing a European Trade Court. I would also like to note that, unfortunately, poorer people still have more limited access to justice and people with incomes below the poverty line are not entitled to any legal aid in certain types of disputes.

I will only repeat now at the end that the Commission will use all the instruments we have to hand, especially the justice score board, which is a very useful benchmarking tool. This is the comparison tool which also serves to help the Member States to look at the progress they and the other Member States made to interpret the reasons for such progress, because it is very important to see why in some Member States the progress hasn’t been made. As Mr Maštálka said, yes we see slow progress, but still – as I said – it is slow, and we need to do better. What is the lesson from the justice score board? It is that digitalisation is not a magic wand, but it is a very important tool which the Member States use to make the processes more rapid and more efficient. It is quite clear that where progress is slow or there is no progress at all, it is a matter of capacities. We need to increase specialisation and professionalism of the judges, and that’s why we are also investing in training. The other matter we look at is how to use the European semester, and here it is an interesting development in the Commission itself, because we stopped looking at the finance which should be covering the expenditures of the judiciary as if they were costs. We more and more look at them as investments, and this is a very important factor when you look at the European semester where we cover the matters which have direct influence on the economic development in the country. That we make a very clear line between a well working judiciary system which has a positive influence on the economy, which gives the guarantee to investors and entrepreneurs that the law is properly enforced in the country and that there is stability in the functioning of the judiciary system and many other things which simply are clearly favourable for the economic situation and progress in the country. We put this topic of finance in judiciary to the Vienna conference, which we had two weeks ago. We had the opportunity to hear how well the World Bank is looking at this connection between financing and the judiciary system, and I think this is something which the Member States should also take into account in planning their budgets. So, once again, a very inspiring report. We will work with it; I will summarise for my followers all the knowledge and the things which should be covered by possible future legislation.

The issues of austerity, because we are talking about them too, of course, we are talking about legal certainty, that these legal instruments should be applied with a sense and full understanding to the various sectors of the economy, to the weaker and stronger, that this justice should be a determinant, but that the finances of the judiciary are also important. In my deep conviction, apart from the fact that shortening the process gives financial savings to the parties who are in conflict at this point in time, it also offers considerable savings for the justice system itself, because it goes without saying that a dispute that is ongoing in court for four to five years also costs the judiciary more than a dispute that closes in a short period of time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, to err humanum est, to persevere with autem diabolicum, which literally translates as 'making mistakes is human, but persevering is diabolical'. How many cases of maladministration are afflicting Europe? So many, too many. In my experience as an MEP, this is the fifth year that I find myself commenting on the work of the European Ombudsman, this year as rapporteur for the European Parliament's report. This work, that of the Mediator, which is not only carried out with great care and rigour, but which is becoming increasingly crucial in guaranteeing the highest levels of protection of citizens' democratic rights, for which I thank you. Yet, as every year, we find ourselves here debating the new cases of maladministration that overwhelm the European institutions, without the mistakes of the past being used by this Europe to learn its lesson. Conflicts of interest, lack of transparency, 'revolving doors', lobbies and lobbying without effective controls, decisions taken behind closed doors are just some of the problems that this Europe still does not want to tackle in practice, increasing that sense of mistrust towards it and, consequently, the gap between citizens and institutions. The European Mediator's approach and the recommendations made have always been high-profile and constructive. Unfortunately, however, all too often the leaders of the European institutions have been indifferent to what they were asked to do and unwillingness to make substantial improvements on central issues on which the Union's credibility and image are at stake. The image of the 'glass palace' should be the beacon to be followed in order to remove all barriers between those inside and outside the palaces of power, in order to build a European Union that is truly based on respect for the principles of ethics, moral integrity and transparency. It is for this reason that in the report, in addition to retracing some of the most serious cases that marked 2017, I wanted to openly support the recommendations made by the Mediator, giving them further prominence and strength. We now need stricter rules on the integrity obligations that European Commissioners must comply with, both during and at the end of their term of office. It was a shock to the whole of the European Union that Mr Barroso, President of the Commission in the years of the worst economic crisis, took on goldman sachs, the business bank that was most involved in the very outbreak of that crisis. Therefore, the recent meeting, in October 2017, that the current Vice-President Katainen has made with Barroso himself and recorded as a meeting with Goldman Sachs is therefore also highly objectionable. This further gesture has made it clear that Mr Barroso, despite what he had done and his commitment not to lobby the EU institutions, has always managed to find open doors with the highest institutional leaders, ready to welcome him. The Barroso case is perhaps the most striking, but Transparency International, in its investigations, as early as 2017 indicated that 50 % of commissioners passed to work for very powerful private sector lobbies, including Bank of America and Volkswagen. If we also consider that there is a register of transparency on lobbying at EU level, which is burdened with very serious shortcomings and to which it adheres only on a voluntary basis, we can see how opaque lobbying activities are in the EU institutions and how unhindered the private sector can affect decision-making processes unhindered. In relation to this, the report called for a legislative act leading to the adoption of a compulsory and legally binding transparency register for all EU lobbyists and institutions and agencies. Stricter rules are also being demanded of the European Central Bank, in order to protect the integrity, reputation and independence of the institution from private financial interests, given that its President, Mario Draghi, persists in wanting to be a member of a club, the so-called G30, which operates in complete darkness and collects the gotha of the private financial and banking world, including the heads of banks under the supervision of the ECB itself. With regard to the Legislative Process of the European Union, the report calls for full protection of citizens' right to know the choices made throughout the decision-making process. There is still a serious lack of transparency in the trialogues, which are still completely inaccessible to the public, as well as in the procedures followed by the Council, where the positions adopted by the Member States on legislative dossiers are still not registered and citizens' requests for access to documents are rejected on time. The choice, which I consider shameful, to extend the use of glyphosate until December 2022 and the use of scientific data provided by the same manufacturer, Monsanto, in the procedures adopted at EU level for the assessment of human health risks led to the request of the Mediator for the immediate launch of an investigation, also extending to the EU procedures for the collection and evaluation of scientific data on GMOs , plant protection products and medicinal products. These cases are just some of those addressed in the report, which give us an insight into a highly deficient situation that needs timely remedies. Citizens must enjoy a European Union in which the duty of moral integrity is guaranteed in the behaviour of all its representatives, where a truly transparent administration is ensured and protected from conflicts of interest with the private sector. The citizens of Europe deserve a completely different European Union from what it is at present. Finally, allow me to make one final point: it is with regret that I welcome the many amendments tabled by the Group of the European People's Party, aimed at weakening the text and deleting and putting under the carpet many of these cases that we have talked about. I would like to thank the Mediator once again for her hard work, I thank all my colleagues for their contributions to this report, I thank my staff and I await the Commissioner's comment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 178, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Emyli O'Reilly", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Ombudsman. – Mr President, good evening and thank you, Madame Evi and all of the shadow rapporteurs, for your work on this report. Let me of course first express my deep condolences to the families of those killed last night in Strasbourg and send my best wishes to those who were injured. Our thoughts are with them and their families tonight and also with all the members of the army, police and emergency services who so often put their own lives on the line to protect ours. Thank you also to DG SAFE and the staff of this Parliament for their work in alerting us last night and for protecting our security. Honourable Members, as Ombudsman I help Europeans in their interactions with the administration of the EU institutions. Over the last five years, I’ve been able to do so only because of the engagement and cross-party support of this House. I also very much welcome the presence of Commissioner Jourová at this debate. As in previous years, accountability and transparency-related inquiries have accounted for the highest percentage of my office’s work. The EU administration has some of the highest standards of administration in the world, but as a comparatively young system the EU also faces challenges which makes it vital for its institutions, bodies and agencies to be as accountable and transparent about their decisions as possible. For example, while the Parliament is proactively transparent in its legislative work, the Council of the EU falls short of the appropriate requirements of transparency and participatory democracy that the Treaties demand. In an inquiry opened in 2017, I therefore called on the Council to improve the recording and publication of legislative documents so that citizens and indeed national parliaments can be better informed and hold their national governments to account. I subsequently sent a special report to Parliament to ask for its support for my recommendations, and Parliament is now working on a report on this subject to be tabled for plenary in January.  I thank the two rapporteurs, Ms Toom and Mr Leinen, and all other members of the two committees involved, who supported my report. This is a good example of Parliament’s ability to find common ground and work together when it comes to supporting my work and the accountability of the EU system. The draft Toom/Leinen report states that ‘greater openness on the positions taken by national governments may serve to alleviate the ‘blame Brussels’ phenomenon, which distorts the reality of how EU legislation is agreed, fomenting euro scepticism and anti-EU sentiment’.  The challenge that public administrations face in a time of widespread disinformation is also an issue that my office has touched on. In 2017 I hosted an event on EU agencies, how to manage the risk of reputational damage with the directors of EFSA and ECHA. These agencies are vital in the protection of our health and it is important that the important factual messages they send out have widespread acceptance. My work naturally requires me to highlight administrative issues which need attention, but I also witness all of the good work of EU officials and their willingness to learn and evolve following my recommendations and suggestions. Sometimes a gentle reminder can achieve more than a formal inquiry can.  In 2017 I published a practical dos and don’ts guide for EU officials on how they should interact with lobbyists and how they can protect their institution and the public interest. The guide is now being used by the Commission in its training for new staff and I want to thank the Commission for its support.  Honourable Members, to acknowledge the excellent work of EU officials, in 2017 I launched the award for good administration with more than 90 projects nominated. The overall award went to DG SANTE for its promotion of EU collaboration in helping millions of Europeans suffering from rare diseases.  A few weeks ago I launched the 2018 awards, which will be presented in spring 2019, and I look forward to even more entries so that best practice can be shared and citizens can be made more aware of the positive impact of the EU administration on their daily lives. Last March I hosted our annual European Network of Ombudsmen conference in Brussels, with the topic ‘Future of the EU – Ensuring an inclusive and fair society for citizens’. The annual event brings together over 90 European, national and regional ombudsmen to share good practice and to have the opportunity personally to interact with MEPs and with Commission officials at the heart of the EU itself. Dealing with complaints to my office, of course, is, and always will remain, the core work of my office. 2017 saw an increase in overall complaints to my office. 2 200 complaints in total and this strong upward trend has continued in 2018. While we have introduced new efficiencies, my office will, in the near future, require a modest increase in budget to hire more case handlers so that the expectations of our complainants can be met. As your report on my activities recognises, further examples of issues we have worked on in 2017 include: (i) our inquiry with the EEAS to stop unpaid internships. This was supported by the Budget Committee, and this means that the EU is now an example around the world, as it now pays its trainees; (ii) our inquiry into how the European Medicines Agency handles meetings with the pharmaceutical industry and before they submit applications for drug authorisations; (iii) our year-long inquiry into the ECB President’s continued membership of the Group of 30, a private group of senior bankers; and (iv) our ongoing work with the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.

And thank you, the Members of Parliament, for supporting my office in its efforts to maintain the high standards of public administration in the EU.

The European Ombudsman has been an essential part of the EU institutional architecture since 1995 and I would like to thank Ms Emily O’Reilly for her work to help citizens make the EU administration a better administration.  European citizens are entitled to high administrative standards from EU institutions and bodies. This is why the work of the Ombudsman in fighting maladministration is so important. Often, the Ombudsman acts as a facilitator or go-between to help solve concrete problems. The Commission is always ready to find solutions whenever it can. The figures speak for themselves. Only 5% of the Ombudsman’s inquiries end in a closing decision of maladministration. The compliance rate of EU institutions and bodies in general with the Ombudsman’s recommendation is also high, at around 80%, showing how effective the work of the Ombudsman is. The Commission takes swift action to address cases of maladministration and complies with the Ombudsman’s recommendations whenever possible.  Every administration can get better. There is a high willingness on the side of the EU administration to correct mistakes, to improve where necessary but also to take new initiatives in the general interest of the Union and the citizens. This also deserves to be said and acknowledged. This is why the Commission particularly appreciates the Ombudsman’s initiative for an award for good administration that she launched in 2016. As we already heard, the Ombudsman conferred the overall award to a Commission service, namely DG Health, and four out of seven specific awards to other Commission services. Please also allow me to say a word about transparency and ethical standards, since these topics are addressed in your report as well. I would like to emphasise that, in these areas, the Commission lives up to very high standards, often higher than in many other administrations. In the area of lobbying transparency, the Commission has led by example. To meet a Commissioner, Cabinet Member or Director-General, lobbyists must first sign up to the transparency register. In our proposal for an interinstitutional agreement, we have suggested to extend this principle to the Parliament and the Council. This would represent a major step forward towards greater transparency at EU level, as the register would become de facto mandatory for lobbyists.  The Commission’s ethical rules, enshrined in the Staff Regulations, prevent the risk of conflict of interest and ensure that Commission staff act impartially and for the public good. This was reinforced last June by a new decision on officials’ outside activities and activities after leaving the service. The new Code of Conduct adopted in January sets clearer rules and higher ethical standards for Members of the Commission, while also increasing transparency.  The Commission will continue to work with the Ombudsman to ensure good administration and maintain the highest possible standards of public service.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 180, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Lukas MANDL", "mepid": "190713", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Commissioner and, above all, Mrs O'Reilly, Mrs O'Reilly, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for her excellent work. It is about the report on citizens' rights on the European Ombudsman' Office, and in particular about citizens' rights in relation to the state sector. I would like to focus on three points in the short time available. Firstly, parliamentarism and the role of us as a Parliament in this process. Secondly, directly on the work of Mrs O'Reilly and her ombudsman. Thirdly, an important area that we have included in this report. I would also like to start with this in a moment, because it seems to me to be the most important, namely the area of anti-Semitism.  In Europe, we are witnessing an increase in anti-Semitism in three dimensions: the old anti-Semitism, the new anti-Semitism and the kind of anti-Semitism that is expressed in double standards towards the State of Israel. That is not what we want in Europe. We must fight this in Europe, and we must do so with all our might. It is important that we have been able to include in the report to be voted on tomorrow that the ombudsmen in the Member States are also particularly called upon to pay more attention to anti-Semitic developments. The second area I would like to address is, in concrete terms, what the Ombudsman is doing. More than 15,000 enquiries and concerns from citizens have been received by the Ombudsman in 2017. More than 1 000 have been transferred to public authorities, and almost 2 000 have been specifically classified as citizens' concerns, and Mrs O'Reilly has set more than 400 specific activities, 14 of them on her own initiative. I say this so clearly because the figures reflect what is being done here, and because it should also be a sign to us as a Parliament that we are - yes - responsible for legislation and, yes, also for the control of the authorities of the European Commission, and specifically that we, as parliamentarians, are also called upon to represent citizens' concerns. , especially as a representative of the citizens in relation to the state sector. In this sense, Madam Ombudswoman, you can really serve as a model for parliamentarians. I would like to thank the rapporteur for her cooperation. She has mentioned that she is not pleased that we in the European People's Party have tabled a number of additional amendments – that is part of the parliamentary process.

Thanks also to the work done in committee, it is a report which, in my opinion, lacks Euroscepticism and unfounded criticism of the European Union system, which does not lend itself to easy anti-European and nationalist polemics. , and the responsibilities of the Member States, if it is at that level that decisions are actually taken, so that the bad habit of offloading the inadequacy of national policies on to the European Union ceases once and for all. The reality of the data highlighted by the Ombudsman in his report leaves little room for interpretation or timidity, and it is certainly no coincidence that the three main issues covered by the Ombudsman's inquiries closed in 2017 were transparency and access to documents, the culture of service and respect for procedural rights. It means that much more can be done in this direction. The European Union must therefore play its part, for example by publishing the key documents of trialogues, as requested by the Ombudsman, or , and I say this as a member of the Committee on the Procedure for authoring pesticides by the Eu ropean Union, by launching a strategic investigation to assess how, for example, the Eu ropean Union agencies and bodies ensure the collection and examination of independent scientific evidence. These are just two examples of the demands contained in this report, which I consider to be balanced and balanced in relation to the positions of the Ombudsman, which remains a point of reference for citizens, as demonstrated by the petitions coming to the European Parliament, and I am also a member of that committee. The demands made on the Union to improve itself must, however, be inspired by the conviction that the European Union is a valuable goal for cooperation between our countries, in practice for our entire community. The Ombudsman will continue to play a key role in the democratic stability of the institutions and in the construction of Europe and in identifying the major issues that have a negative impact on the lives of European citizens.

Mr President, we are discussing the European Ombudsman's action report for 2017. I think it is a very important job on Mrs O'Reilly's part and I congratulate her on her work, as well as congratulating the rapporteur, Mrs Evi. The issues raised are very important. I think they focus on the concept of transparency and of course on combating maladministration and, when we look at these things in the light of the activities of the institutions, we will find that there is a serious issue with the Commission, which, while it is often obliged to refer the Member States for infringement of Community legislation, does not. This is a classic case of maladministration. The second case of maladministration is that of revolving doors. It is not possible to have a former President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, working for a private company such as Goldman Sachs. In addition, we had a problem with the appointment of the Secretary-General of the Commission. These show that there needs to be a clear change in the way the Commission works, as well as in the way experts are appointed, so that there is no conflict of interest.  For the Council, what can we say? Opacity in the legislative process. No one knows which Member State has voted what, so the Member States are behind the Council's collective decision. The next issue is the European Central Bank. Mr .  Mr Draghi is part of the G30, a classic case of maladministration in an organisation involving private banks, where Mr Draghi is supposed to check on private banks. Finally, we have the functioning of the European Investment Bank. There must also be transparency in its operation. The European Investment Bank cannot give 280 million euros to Fraport as a loan to grab the fourteen regional airports in Greece.

It should be noted that in the report we read that the European Ombudsman also calls on the Commission to adopt a new procedure for the appointment of the Secretary-General in this regard. It seems to me, actually, a little bit. Let us now see what the facts are: the Commission, in its position as Secretary-General, has in fact created an artificial urgency, so as to justify the failure to publish a vacancy notice, and has activated a procedure for selecting the Deputy Secretary-General precisely in order not to fill that role directly but to appoint Mr Söderman in two successive stages.

The worse spectacle is the hasty vote of 450, 500 amendments in an hour, without counting the votes of MPs, sometimes contrary to the opinion of the Chamber, as we have even had an example today when the President insisted that he would not repeat the vote electronically.

However, Emily, as you would know, much, much more needs to be done.  In the north of Ireland, the Committee on the Administration of Justice (CAJ) launched a complaint with you that the Commission failed to fully and faithfully translate their commitments that they made in December in the Joint Brexit Report. Before complaining, the CAJ wrote a letter to President Juncker that has been acknowledged but not yet answered. These are administrative errors and fall within your remit. Whilst it took a year to get sight of the mapping exercise of north-south cooperation, it was only released by the Brits after your call. In February, we were told that Annex I of the backstop would be extensively outlined in the list of directives that we in the north would be able to avail of to uphold our rights. However, it ultimately only contained six anti-discrimination directives. Indeed, we were guaranteed that the people of the north would be able to access and exercise our rights where we reside. However, the wording ‘where we reside’ was not inserted into the Brexit withdrawal agreement. Undoubtedly, the backstop is the least worst option for Ireland, yet the British negotiation tactics have contaminated politics and practices, creating an insidious environment resulting in maladministration. Emily, you should not have to wait for complaints to materialise. You should be able to use your remit to ensure that the Commission’s Brexit commitments are fully and faithfully implemented.  Mr President, on this night I would ask you to allow me just a few more seconds, because as mayhem is unfolding in the Tory party, it is without doubt evident that the people in the north of Ireland should have their say what Union they want to be a part of, and the test has been met in the Good Friday Agreement for a unity poll to be triggered.

If public confidence in political decision-making is to be increased, lobbying must be more transparent.

Less than a fortnight ago, Mr Draghi took part in another G30 meeting in New York. The ECB is charged with directly supervising many of the financial institutions that are represented in the G30, including Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and many more. There is no system in place to ensure an ethically appropriate level of distance between the ECB decision-making and supervisory processes and their friends in the G30 bankers’ club. There is no way to ensure that the private bankers and finance CEOs of the G30 don’t influence ECB policy. Mr Draghi’s membership of the G30 is beyond inappropriate. The ECB appears to believe that it is beyond the basic norms of public scrutiny, accountability and transparency, and it faces no consequences for its outright rejection of the Ombudsman’s report.

I always find this debate very inspiring, because it gives me a sense of the issues that we’re working on in the office that are of our particular interest to you, and also it shows me that some of the issues that we have laid particular emphasis on – such as Council transparency – have also found significant resonance right across the Parliament. I noted the comment of Mr Mandl about anti-Semitism and suggesting that the European Network of Ombudsmen take a greater interest in that, and I would like to assure him that that is something that we are actually doing: increasingly, some of the network ombudsmen have that specific task, and I have suggested that that is an area that we could discuss at our seminar in Brussels next year. On Council transparency: yes, on the opacity of decision-making, I think Ms Auken pointed to the fact that this is really about the exercising of every citizen’s right to participate in our democracy, and of course that is the cornerstone of the inquiry and that is essentially why we’re doing it. A number of Members talked about our inquiry – not an own-initiative inquiry, but because we got complaints in relation to it – on the appointment of the new Secretary—General of the Commission. The Commission has responded to us, and I shall be very shortly responding to them. I was interested in a comment by Mr Csáky acknowledging that my office can’t do everything, and also acknowledging the difficulty that there is sometimes in getting some of my recommendations fully accepted. I should point out that, depending on the year, between 80% and 90% of recommendations are accepted, but there are some that aren’t accepted. This can be an issue because in most Member States, with the standards of administration that we see in the EU, it is a relatively rare event that an ombudsman’s recommendation is not accepted. I think it doesn’t mean that you have to make recommendations that are so easy that everybody accepts them; I think you have to be a little bit brave and not shy away from difficult recommendations. But when there are particularly sensitive ones, then it is important that I get the support of Parliament, and I think that that puts pressure on it. I recognise the Members talking about Brexit. Yes, I have looked for opportunities that I can appropriately use in my office to support citizens in relation to that. I was pleased that the mapping exercise has been published, and I will continue to work on it and I take note of the other comments that were made.

I believe that full transparency of the decision-making process at European Union level is needed, because in a system based on the principle of democratic legitimacy, all institutions must be held accountable for their actions before the public.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 201, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "   The next item is the report by Cecilia Wikström, on behalf of the Committee on Petitions, on the deliberations of the Committee on Petitions in 2017 (2018/2104(INI)) (A8-0404/2018).", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 202, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Pál CSÁKY", "mepid": "124930", "text": "  deputising for the rapporteur. – Mr President, the petitions we receive in the Committee on Petitions (PETI) help us to better assess the impact that EU legislation has on people’s daily lives and to find loopholes and problems with the implementation of EU legislation. By acting as a bridge between citizens and institutions, the Committee on Petitions can contribute to both the creation of better legislation and helping people in their everyday lives. The number of petitions received per year is rather constant, even if it is important to note that the petitions received during 2017 was the lowest number during this mandate. However, the new system put in place via the PETI portal, which allows citizens to support existing petitions has increased greatly this past year – up from 6 000 users who supported a petition in 2016 to 15 000 users who supported a petition in 2017. This is a very positive trend which means that citizens can show they have support for an issue without having to file a petition by themselves. It was therefore an important milestone when the petitions network was launched in March 2017. It serves as a useful tool for better follow-up on petitions in parliamentary and legislative work, increases the visibility for the petitions received within the House, and intensifies cooperation with colleagues in the other committees. The main area of concern of the petitions received during 2017 were environmental matters such as such as water and waste management, and preservation. This demonstrates the need for proper environmental legislation and implementation. Other areas of concern were fundamental rights, especially voting rights and children’s rights, the free movement of persons, and social affairs such as working conditions. The Committee on Petitions had discussions on petitions covering these subjects in various committee meetings during 2017. The work in the Committee on Petitions is very rewarding, due to the direct contact with citizens. It’s a constant reminder of the results of the legislation that we are working on, and for whom we write the laws. It’s both interesting and demanding to meet the various petitioners who come to the committee and talk about their problems. We cannot always solve the citizens’ problems but we can at least raise awareness of their concerns. We can all always do better and together we should strive to improve our citizens’ support even further. The chair of the Committee on Petitions, Ms Cecilia Wikström, looks forward to continuing this work together with her colleagues until the end of the mandate. Finally, the chair of the Committee is very pleased with the work done in the Committee on Petitions and the results achieved together. She would like to thank all the colleagues and the Secretariat of the Committee on Petitions for the good cooperation and work done during 2017.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 203, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, let me begin by thanking Ms Wikström, Mr Csáky and the whole Committee on Petitions (PETI) for the comprehensive report on the activities of PETI in 2017. Like its predecessors in previous years, the report gives evidence of the wide range of issues that petitioners bring to PETI’s attention each year, and of the committee’s efforts to ensure that the voices of those petitioners are really heard. The Commission shares Parliament’s view that the right to petition is both a fundamental right of all EU citizens and a key element of participatory democracy, allowing for citizens’ active engagement in the fields of EU action. Citizens often turn to the committee as a last resort because they feel that they have exhausted all other avenues, and we, both the Commission and the Parliament, can demonstrate that we listen to their concerns and take them seriously by offering proper responses and, where possible, showing them existing solutions at European or national level. This is a concrete example of how we can collaborate to bolster citizens’ confidence and trust in the European project. However, we should also recognise that there are often cases where the expectations of citizens supersede the powers of the EU. Unmet expectations can lead to frustration and the argument that the EU is simply not up to the task. While this is understandable, though lamentable, it is impossible to answer citizens’ calls that go beyond our competences and EU law. It is our collective duty to inform citizens of the possibilities and limitations of EU law in order to stem unfair accusations that the EU doesn’t want to listen and/or is unfit to act. As the report points out, our institutions have built good working relationships in recent years when it comes to handling petitions. Of the petitions declared admissible by the Parliament in 2017, about two-thirds were referred to the Commission for an opinion. In return, the 670 replies that the Commission sent back to the Parliament in 2017 testify to our engagement to support the critical work of the committee, which the Commission takes very seriously. All Commission replies are prepared with care and are widely consulted upon among its services. Appropriately ranked officials with expert knowledge of the issues discussed participate in the committee’s meetings with the aim of providing the most meaningful and up-to-date information in a timely manner. Here I am therefore pleased to reaffirm the commitment of the Commission to continue our good collaboration and to bring forward the EU added value in the resolutions of petitioners’ concerns. The report calls on the Commission to make proper use of its powers stemming from its role as guardian of the Treaties, and for a timely handling of infringement procedures. The Commission’s new enforcement policy sets out a more strategic, effective and proportionate approach to infringement policy to allow us to deliver on our policy priorities. We will give priority to pursuing the most important breaches of EU law affecting the interests of citizens and businesses. One key development is that we will launch infringement procedures without relying on the EU pilot mechanism unless recourse to this mechanism is seen as useful in a given case. This will allow us to act firmly and quickly when infringements obstruct the key EU policy objectives and to ensure timely handling of infringement procedures. The main objective of infringement procedures is to ensure that Member States give effect to EU law. These often lengthy procedures are conducted between the Commission and a Member State and are not designed to provide for individual cases. As guardian of the Treaties, the Commission enjoys discretionary power which allows it to decide to open or not to open an infringement procedure. According to the Treaties, where citizens’ rights under EU law are affected at national level they must have access to rapid and effective national redress mechanisms. As the Commission stated in its 2016 communication, national courts are the common courts for upholding EU law and contribute effectively to enforcing it in individual cases. As for informing the Parliament about ongoing EU pilot investigations and infringement procedures related to petitions, the Commission strives to give as much information as possible in its written replies to Parliament. However, it has to respect the necessary confidentiality with regard to the Member State concerned, as recognised by the Court of Justice. More generally, the Commission proactively disseminates information on infringements and publishes it on the centralised platform of the Europa website. The report also touches upon a number of other important issues for which the views of Parliament and the Commission largely converge. Let me only mention the high priority in preserving citizens’ rights after the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union, or the protection of the rights of persons with disabilities. I will, however, end my remarks here once again thanking Ms Wikström and the PETI Committee for your very helpful report.

It constitutes, in fact, a bridge between them and the EU institutions. In my opinion, our committee has an important role in raising awareness through a debate, ensuring public participation and cooperation with Member States, and within the House through the petitions network that was launched last year. The subjects raised in the petitions of 2017 pertain mostly to environmental matters, fundamental rights, free movement of people, child welfare and social affairs. Our work is not limited to the handling of petitions. The Committee organises fact-finding visits and hearings, commissions studies, gives opinions to legislative committees, is a member of the European network of Ombudsmen, and had a role in revising the regulation on the European citizens’ initiative. Last year, we dedicated a lot of time to petitions on Brexit, as they encompassed vital contributions to citizens ahead of the negotiations. As a committee we raised important questions to plenary by means of oral questions and resolutions. Here I would like to firmly state that we should stick to our mandate as a committee. I have the impression that some of my colleagues would like to take over the role of legislative committees.

I remember over the years the many cases dealt with, the many answers we have given to the European citizens who have addressed us. I will mention one for all: the case of the children who disappeared in Spain under the regime of Francisco Franco, a story that marked me, also personally and in particular, to which we committed ourselves with a mission that had touching moments, when we met the now elderly mothers who are still looking for these children.

Mr President, the Committee on Petitions really is the committee which is directly linked to the citizens. It is the only committee in which citizens can come forward and speak, and that is a qualitative difference.

Let me just point out that once again the Committee on Petitions rejected my request to hold a public hearing on the serious issue of German compensation, an issue of concern to Greece, but unfortunately once again the Committee on Petitions did not accept my proposal. I hope that he will deal in the next period with the new report that I will be reporting on the issue of German reparations, the issue of German debts, which include the compulsory occupation loan, the compensation of the relatives of the victims executed by the German occupying troops and the war reparations.

Unfortunately, we continue to see an absence of interest from States to transpose or implement the legislation correctly. We have seen an irresponsible attitude on the part of state authorities in implementing, for example, the Air Quality Directive, the Water Framework Directive, international obligations in humanitarian aid, the Directives on the protection of precarious workers, the ratification of the Istanbul Convention or respect for the principle of the free movement of citizens to prevent expulsions in Member States. After assessing so many cases, which also affect my country, we cannot be surprised by the crisis of legitimacy of this Union, which we are currently seeing and suffering. I am also still outraged at the European Commission's lack of reaction in many cases. The European Commission needs to be more involved in its replies, please, and with its actions. On many occasions, the Commission takes several years to bring the offending States to the Court of Justice.

A year ago, I was talking about the activities of the Committee on Petitions last year about the fact that the largest number of petitions come from Romania and Greece in proportion to the population. Romania is ahead of only the large Member States, Germany, Italy and Spain. Unfortunately, nothing has changed in this respect. In 2017, 5.2% of petitions came from Romania, making it the fourth in a row and 3.7% from Greece, sixth in order. Romania has already outsked the United Kingdom in this area in the previous year, which is a major concern. It is also interesting that if we look at the nationality of the submitters, the order does not change, but the proportions do: 6.8% of the submitters are Romanians and 4% are Greek citizens. On the one hand, these facts give rise to optimism, because Romanian and Greek citizens are increasingly exercised their rights to EU citizenship and petition the European Parliament, and on the other hand these figures also highlight the fact that, in addition to the large Member States, Romania and Greece are attracting an outlier number of petitions, i.e. these two Member States deserve special attention from the European Parliament. It is also clear from the Committee on Petitions' activities in 2017 that a very large number of petitions submitted concern fundamental rights and justice. In addition to environmental protection, the European Union has much to do in this regard, as citizens have a legitimate expectation that European law will be applied to the same standards throughout the EU.

This is partly due to the lack of information about the EU, but also partly due to the lack of reaction from the institutions. Unfortunately, numerous petitions get superficial replies from the Commission, which leads petitioners to conclude that the whole institutional system of the EU is inefficient. The European Parliament, as the institution receiving the petitions, has a special role to play in the process of turning citizens’ claims into a real political change. But to make it a reality, we need to intervene on multiple levels. First, we need to ensure that information on EU law is made available to specific groups of citizens in the most user—friendly way. Information on filing a petition should also be made clearer. Second, we need to make sure that petitions manage to bring a mindful impact on EU policies. Petition is the right of any EU citizen, but we cannot give a right that does not really empower people. Some petitions are closed without people getting a concrete reply. This is the case of numerous petitions on the problem of non-citizenship in Latvia: this is a problem that affects 12% of the population, and has lasted for 27 years already. The only hope of Latvian non—citizens is an efficient reply at the EU level. When the petition becomes the only one and single tool, we cannot allow this single tool to be useless. Third, based on the petition statistics, we need to enhance cooperation with Member State authorities on the matter of implementation of EU law.

They turn not when they are very well – we do not have many petitions from citizens from Denmark or Luxembourg, for example – but when they feel injustice, when they have problems, when they need someone to just give them a hand. They also turn to issues that we widely regard as broader but relevant to our environment.  Here, Mr Mamikins very rightly emphasised that it is important that they translate into decisions. This is our role to treat these petitions as a source of information, as a way of getting down to earth sometimes. At the same time, let us be aware that even if sometimes we do not help directly, we will at least listen.

My choice of the word ‘collective’ in this context is a deliberate one, as both Parliament and the Commission have key roles to play in this area. And as Vice—President Liberadzki said, there is always something uncomfortable at the beginning: this is always the complaint of people about something wrong; something that they find unjust; something which they would like to see solved. A large number of petitions and a diversity of issues entail a combination of this bad start but also something very good: it is the proof that the people have confidence that if they come to us with their complaint we will do something useful. That we will deal with the complaints, that we will come up with a solution if it is within our power, and that we can come up with a workable solution which will change the situation for the better. This high level of confidence which the people show to us through their petitions is also a very strong commitment for all of us.

If you don't mind, I'm going to use my native language. After the European People's Party has asked me to speak on this subject, allow me to summarise my own opinion and that of the European People's Party in three points and then conclude this debate from the position of The President of the Commission. Firstly, I would like to emphasise once again to all colleagues that the Committee on Petitions is the only committee in this House that has direct contact with citizens. It is very important what image we give of ourselves when we develop relationships with citizens and try to solve the problems they raise. I would therefore also like to ask the European Commission, I would also like to ask the other commissions, to give the Peti Commission more prestige, to take the requests of the Peti Committee seriously. I believe that the good work that has been done so far can still be improved, and let us not forget that the Peti Commission can essentially function as a conscience of the European Union, because if there are problems and citizens turn to us, it is also a show of trust. The other thing, Mr President, I, you know, come from Eastern Europe, Slovakia, a small country – I am also a representative of a small community in the Hungarian community, which is 10% of the country – and I have also been Deputy Prime Minister of Slovakia on two occasions, so I can also judge the activities of the offices and judge the opinions and requests of the citizens. I therefore consider it one of my tasks and I am very pleased that several of my colleagues on the committee have joined me in reinforcing people's legal consciousness and reinforcing their civic consciousness. If they can articulate a petition well and stand up for their rights, I think it will strengthen Europe because we need strong citizens in Europe. And the third thing, dear Mr President, if you will allow me – and now, as Vice-President of the Committee, on behalf of the Committee – I would like to thank my colleagues for their cooperation in committee, and I would like to thank parliament's plenary for its support. In February this year, something happened that has not yet happened: on the proposal of the Committee on Petitions, a 'short resolution', a decision has been taken on the protection of indigenous minorities, for example, which I would like to thank you for now! I would also like to thank the Secretariat for its work. The head of the secretariat will now be transferred to another position, leaving the secretariat, Mrs Virpi. Allow me to thank Mrs Virpi by name for her work. And I would like to ask that there be excellent cooperation in the committee in the future, not on the basis of political considerations, but on the basis of a discussion of the material problems.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 216, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Fabio Massimo CASTALDO", "mepid": "124812", "text": "   The debate is closed.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, we have the opportunity to present one of the programmes, that relating to the European Union's space strategy, which, with less uncertainty, documents, I believe, the usefulness of a strong Europe, of a Europe with concrete leadership. The Great Space Tradition of the European Union finally has the opportunity to be achieved through an integrated programme, as proposed by the Commission. There are a number of elements on which the work we have carried out in recent months is based, a fruitful work in which we have tried to build on the Commission's proposal, which has certainly put us in a position to operate properly. First of all, the theme of the budget. The budget proposed by the European Commission is an important budget of EUR 16 billion. We have worked to improve, to a certain extent, its ability to cover all the needs that have emerged, in particular on Copernicus and, I have to say, a strong discussion on the new programmes, namely SSA and GOVSATCOM, and maintaining the primacy in terms of the budget allocated, in our opinion correctly, to Galileo and EGNOS. From this type of work, our proposal, which emerges, as you know, Commissioner, now amounts to EUR 16.9 billion and it is important that it is not reduced. Then, among the various pillars on which the space strategy is based, there is the industrial theme. European industry in the space sector has an enormous impact capacity and we believe that the Commission's proposal to propose an integrated programme, which will put all the various programmes in a solid and structured relationship, including the EGNOS, Galileo, Copernicus programmes and also the new SSA and GOVSATCOM programmes, is correct. This will, in our view, generate efficiency and, on the other hand, reduce unnecessary costs, thus reducing unnecessary duplication and repetition, which have sometimes, in the past, reduced the programme's firepower from an industrial point of view. A second central element from an industrial point of view is the whole game linked to downstream: we need an articulated and detailed dissemination and use of all the data and services generated by the space programme. This will be of great benefit to end-users and, of course, to the whole industry which must be able to make use of these services. We are very strong on the upstream, we must also become so on the downstream, so that the supply chain is complete. This is a judgment that also emerges from the assessment of the enormous impact that a good space programme can have on the geopolitical game. Today we are living in a context of serious geopolitical uncertainty. In a nutshell, we can say that a space programme with the above characteristics would allow us to have four major points of advantage for the European Union: competitiveness, first of all, sustainability, autonomy – why not? especially in the management of some sensitive data – and security. The articulation of these four major pillars will generate the expected result, namely real European leadership through a completed space programme worthy of the name. The second part – and I will close, I am going to conclude – which concerns the negotiation phase that we have been through so far, and which we will be addressing, is the great game of governance. I would like to say a few brief words on this but, in my view, useful and determined to achieve this. The European Commission has overall responsibility for the space programme, oversees its security and coordinates all the bodies involved in the implementation of this programme, in particular what is now the GSA, that is, the Agency that will become the European Union Agency for the Space Programme, and the European Space Agency, which traditionally contains the best expertise within it. So the European Union Agency for the Space Programme with increased competences, but above all constant coordination by the European Commission: these are the secrets for the space strategy to be carried out. I would like to add one final point because, Mr President, Commissioner, in addition to being rapporteur in the ITRE Committee, I was, and am also, draftsman of the opinion of the TRAN Committee and therefore brings together in this speech the two elements, the two horns of the problem. With regard to the important impact we have on transport, within the framework of the space strategy, I am not going to dwell on it, of course, it is part of what I have already said as far as industry is concerned. But let us think about the theme of sustainability, the theme of the use of drones in the improvement of postal services, the theme of the game of environmental sustainability through more careful and articulated management of traffic, especially road traffic. Then there is the question of aircraft: there is a need, as far as air transport is concerned, to ensure that the I would like to thank the Commissioner for his work on this subject, and i.e. the commission of the European Parliament. That is why I would like to say thank you: thank you to all my colleagues and to the shadow rapporteurs with whom we have worked so far, creating compromises, in my opinion, that are equal to the great challenge and thanks to the Commission's proposal, which has put us in a position to work properly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 219, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first I want to personally thank the rapporteur and also the shadow rapporteurs for their work and for their really devoted support for this file. We see this file as very important for the future position of Europe as a global and competitive space actor. Let me just briefly say a few words on what the idea behind it was and why we decided to table this proposal. Europe has definitely gained momentum in space. Our space programmes, as we call them, ‘flagship’ ones – Galileo, Copernicus and EGNOS – are operational. They are on time and on budget. They offer really quality services to users with performances that really exceed expectations – ours and everyone’s. In the coming years, the European space sector will also have to deal with major challenges in relation, of course, with global evolutions on environmental, economic, security and geopolitical levels, and additionally there is a disruptive wave in the making. Of course, it is especially coming from the US, and we also see the emergence of the new private space actors, new business models and new technologies in this field. This is what the space programme that the Commission proposed is all about. Climate change, digitalisation, data economy, security, safety of people and goods, competitiveness of the European space industry, strategic autonomy – that was mentioned before – and technological independence are all issues that are directly linked to the space programme that we are discussing here today. Following that space strategy that we adopted together and that was endorsed by this Parliament just two years ago, the EU space programme has the following objectives in order to address those key challenges that we are facing. The first very important one is to ensure the continuity of the existing space infrastructure and the services, and at the same time, the development of the new and enhanced ones. The second is to foster an evolution to ensure that our current programmes and projects are responding to the new needs – more precise positioning for connected cars, for example – but also fighting climate change and ensuring more security for Europeans. These are all issues that we want to tackle with our space programmes. Additionally, we want to promote the emergence of the European ‘new space’ approach. This is not about copy—pasting what is done in the US, but to invent a genuine European approach to maintain an innovative European space sector that is able to compete globally. The third point is to adapt to new realities. We must see the space sector as an enabler of our security. That is why we are proposing to launch two new components: space situational awareness (SSA), allowing to protect our satellites in orbit, and GOVSATCOM, to allow secured communication by satellites. We also proposed an element to maintain the EU capacity to have autonomous access to space, relying on EU independent industry – again, it was mentioned by the rapporteur.  For all these priorities, we proposed a budget of EUR 16 billion for the next MFF. This is, of course, an ambitious agenda, but one we think is necessary to make sure that Europe remains the second space power globally. I’m happy that the Commission’s proposal for the EU space programme has been equally supported by the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE), but also by the associated committees: the Committee on Budgets (BUDG), the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), the Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) and the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI). I know that these committees have, in particular, raised some important elements to our discussion: for example, the importance of ensuring the adequate funding necessary to maintain state—of—the—art and innovative Galileo and Copernicus initiatives, and the importance for the European Union to be ambitious on the new programmes, including SSA and GOVSATCOM, as I mentioned. These programmes are really crucial to protect the key interests of the Union, and the Commission noted with great interest the remarks from the committees on the need to ensure sufficient budgets for them. The impact of the space programme on the whole European economy, in particular for small and medium—sized enterprises, but also for mid—caps, and the need to better support space startups, the importance of maintaining an autonomous access to space and the impact of the European space initiatives on the other policy areas – that was also mentioned before – agriculture, transport, of course, environment, climate monitoring, security and defence.

It enables Member States to realise technology benefits that are too substantial for any individual Member State, and as well as that obvious economy of scale, the added value created by the space programme is considerable: the direct benefits, for example, of a competitive space sector worth around EUR 60 billion a year, providing 230 000 high-skill, high quality jobs. Value—added benefits already realised in fishing policy, environmental programmes, precision farming, transport and traffic modelling are also contributors of added value. In this way, we get a greater return from EU budgets, and we also get data for better informed budget decision—making. A couple of cautionary words: the Commission is creating a European Union agency for the space programme from another agency. This carries some risks, we believe, of duplication with the activities of the European Space Agency. A tight definition of that agency’s brief and diligent scrutiny is the way to mitigate that risk. The progress of this departure, along with the adequacy of funding for Galileo, Copernicus and the new streams, should be reviewed at the mid-term of the MFF. And finally, it is worth observing as a cautionary note that some of the discussion has focused on the notion of a uniquely European Union space industry.

I think it is insanely necessary that we take the existing activities with Copernicus. network with EGNOS, GNSS and, of course, Galileo, and then be able to use the data available there for the different areas. I say to you: this space programme is critical infrastructure, and we can no longer rely on the comrades on the other side of the Atlantic that we used to rely on. I think collaboration with Russia and China can be safe, but Europe needs its own space programme in the digital age. With Galileo, we do not need to put our light under the bushel either. We have our own space station, a space station with launchers, the 20th satellite will go into orbit in 2020, and Galileo is operational and can provide data – in a special way for ship safety. In the Committee on Transport and Social Affairs, we have often discussed this with each other: is it necessary to use pilots, or can we guarantee ship safety, I say on the Strait of Gibraltar, I say on the Bosphorus, I say in the Mediterranean as a whole or also in the Baltic Sea on the Kadetrinne with such a programme? That is possible. Pilot programmes are already under way in this respect, and this is very important.  I am vice-chairman of the Committee on Fisheries. We are discussing a control regulation, which should then have, so to speak, a vessel monitoring system. This can only be done through the appropriate satellite systems that we have. It is then also clear and necessary that the European Fisheries Control Agency in Vigo should be able to record all the data that is then necessary in this regard in order to have real control. This, of course, has something to do with ship safety.

I have long called for the synergy between the Galileo and Copernicus programmes covered by the GSA to be strengthened. Extending security accreditation to other programmes was the first logical step. I am glad that Parliament will now go further and entrust the Agency with other tasks, such as marketing or cybersecurity. The space program is now hiding all space projects under one roof. I have repeatedly said that Galileo and Copernicus have a clear added value for cooperation at European Union level. Some colleagues expressed skepticism about the SSA and, in particular, the GOVSATCOM component. On the contrary, I think that we should also move towards a greater scale here. But at the same time, I see a limited budget.  Furthermore, the involvement of third countries. Here we would like to see greater flexibility mutually beneficial for the European Union and for the friendly countries with which we cooperate in the field of security. Of course, I am thinking first and again of the United Kingdom, whatever the future relationship may be. On the related issue of public procurement: If we have a security agreement with third countries, we should also open tenders for their industry.

Mr President, Dear Commissioner, 'The sky is not the limit' I like to say in good Rotterdam. Especially when it comes to space travel. And with this EU space programme, we are in the leading group worldwide. We're proud of that. This is not about dreamy March trips, but about concrete progress that benefits the hard-working Europeans here and now.  For example, in my own Member State, the Netherlands, we know exactly where and how the soil is falling through space, so that we can maintain our dikes and our infrastructure properly. It helps us to innovate agriculture even further, to tackle the climate problem and to make the most of space during military operations. But there are also concerns. All data produced must be secure and used only for good purposes. Our Galileo and also our Copernicus programme make a lot of data available at the level of detail and we should not run the risk that the influence or application of data will lead to damage to our societies.  With this package, we will not only invest money, but also standardize and open up data to our companies. In this way, we give start-ups and SMEs more opportunities to accelerate their development. This means not only better space technologies, but opening up allows us to innovate on everything. This means making agriculture more environmentally friendly with new techniques, making the transport sector cleaner by further optimising transport flows, and also allowing our medical sector to make people better faster. The frontrunners have the best chance of doing this, so with this package we are going to take start-ups and SMEs in Europe a step further.

It is from all the use, about the overwhelming control of our system and what we have managed to fight for, that this system, with increased funding, will also be so in the future.  Satellites, of course, are also an area of innovation, but not only innovations in technologies and hardware, they are an innovation and in the development of various applications and applications that they also bring. Data and information are the greatest value today. A few weeks ago, a publication by the European Network of Regions using space technologies was presented in the European Parliament – 99 examples of how Copernicus data is used in everyday use in our regions. This shows the recognition not only of the regions but also of all those entrepreneurs and economies who have managed to use this data in the right way.

The objective of the programme is very meritorious: to integrate the various initiatives and implementation programmes and to give them a new impetus in order to ensure a competitive position of the European Union in the space industries. It involves not only its reference companies, but also knowledge centres and the network of small and medium-sized enterprises with high potential in this area. Commissioner, the development of a network of small and medium-sized enterprises spread across the Territory of the Union and with contributions to the European space strategy is a condition of convergence that is worth betting on. The planned investment, as I said, EUR 16 billion for the European space programme, includes a budget of EUR 9.7 billion for the Galileo programme and EUR 5.8 billion for the Copernicus programme. The remaining 500 million are earmarked for initiatives in the field of satellite government communication and knowledge of the situation in space. These are key initiatives of coordination, integration and supervision, but they are clearly underfunded.  The Union needs all its programmes to be perceived by its citizens for the importance they can have in daily life. In the new technological framework, the scope of the defence of populations and vital interests is wider than that established by the traditional reading of past conflicts and, therefore, establishing a rigid boundary between civil ends and the purposes of protection in the event of conflict is an academic exercise.

Bureaucracy and on-the-spot checks are also time, expert and resource costs.

I want to start with one sentence: every one of us needs to know that the European Union’s space sector has recorded a tremendous achievement in this field. This is really something that we should be proud of and we need to repeat this again and again. Our Galileo and Copernicus programmes are the best genuine system in the world and 10% of our newly established start—ups are rooted and have a base in data given by the European Union from those two programmes – almost 10% of newly established start-ups. This is important data and we all need to keep this in mind. The current proposal for the space programme creation is another important milestone in the development of the sector. Let me refer to two points. First, on the overlaps between the European Space Agency and our European Union agency for the space programme in Prague. I want to underline and stress very strongly that there is no overlap in our proposal between the role of those two agencies. Our objective was to clarify precisely the competition between those two agencies and, according to this, to make a very slight adjustment in the governance. We now also have to take the new realities into account of course – Brexit, but also the increasing role of security issues. We are not removing any competition from the European Space Agency. We need to rely on them because they have a lot of genuine and top—quality technical expertise, which is very much needed once the programmes are operational. They need to be managed and be employed by the agency and this will be the European Agency for the space programme in Prague. On the involvement of third countries, we all know that space is about cooperation and that space is global, as one of you said. At the EU level, it is also about cooperation because what we have achieved in our space programme could not have been achieved by any one Member State alone. We understand this, but of course there are some components of our programmes with some essential security elements which are increasing and growing. We must not be naive but must preserve Europe’s strategic interest. We need a kind of flexibility to be on some points strict on the participation of third countries because those security concerns and issues are growing and they take up more and more space in the space programmes. So I want to call on the Parliament to allow us – and allow the space sector – this flexibility through Article 25 of our proposal. These were the two points that I wanted to clarify a little bit, but I think that we can all see what a long way we have come since the first space programme was launched. Parliament has been extremely supportive in this direction and now we must keep this momentum going. This is the most important thing. Our request to you is to have a really constructive and rapid negotiation between the Council, the Commission and Parliament on this really important instrument for European industry, and not only for big companies. This is the most important thing for our start-ups and for our smaller companies, as I explained before. This is important for European citizens – every one of them – and for the European economy. So I very much trust that you will give the mandate to move the proposals to the negotiations tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 233, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Massimiliano SALINI", "mepid": "125670", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I must say that I strongly agree with the words with which you have initiated this synthesis, this conclusion. We Europeans are the best on the space game, he is absolutely right. The performance of our solutions in the more mature programmes such as Galileo and Copernicus document our absolute leadership capacity for the solutions with which we have occupied the construction of truly important infrastructures in these constellations. Now our big game is about downstream. I am only referring to this point among the many that we have touched. The issue of applications, for example: the use of the benefits of Galileo technology forces us to be rigorous. Today, many of the utilities deriving from the Galileo constellation are exploited by non-European applications. The application geolocation systems that we all have on smartphones refer to applications that are not born in Europe, are born outside Europe, and therefore generate benefits outside Europe, free of charge! They use the services of our constellation and make profits that are not here. You rightly mentioned startups and the many challenges we are winning. Let us also win this one of the downstream and we will have taken that path, thanks to the huge public and private investments that we have generated in recent years within space, we will have made the parable and given Europe one of the programmes that, more than any other, in my opinion more than many others, can convince Europeans of the usefulness of the European Union.

First of all, let me thank the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) shadows for the effective, positive and very smooth cooperation we had in committee negotiations. Since the beginning, I very much welcome the Commission proposal as the long-awaited answer to the lack of EU coordination in the digital race with other global competitors such as the US, China and Japan. Member States are multiplying public and private commitments to acquire state-of-the-art technology and to make it easily available for companies as well as for citizens. However, these efforts are too small on a global scale, and they can result in overlapping actions which we cannot allow since resources would be wasted. The EU is a pioneer in research and innovation, but our digital single market witnesses a growing demand for advanced digital products, services and professionals without us having the European capacities to answer it. This programme will focus on five objectives to reinforce the digital transformation, proposing more investment in artificial intelligence, super-computing, cyber security, skills and the spread of technology. Companies, especially SMEs, will be able to approach artificial intelligence and innovative solutions within a framework that preserves our European core values. Researchers and developers in the Union will have easy access to high-performance computers without depending on third countries. In this respect, I would like to remind you that of the top 20 super-computers on this planet, only four of them are at the moment located within the European Union. The European Union needs to count on its own digital serenity when confronted with cybersecurity. We need to catalyse investment to develop within the Union hardware and software applications that ensure a high level of security and also, not to be forgotten, data protection. The programme will also ensure that citizens get the opportunity to acquire advanced digital skills to be able to use the new tools at their disposal, especially in the public administration and public services. As rapporteur, I would like to highlight the key elements that will ensure the success of the programme. We will have in place a network of European digital hubs across Europe that will act as a one-stop shop for our companies to easily benefit from the programme. We will counteract the skills gap in our labour market, offering targeted high-level training to upgrade our professionals’ competences thus unleashing the creation of new job opportunities. And we will promote our European liberal values by prioritising solutions that are fully in line with EU legislation, especially on data protection, that are based on open licensing policies and open standards, and that respect Union ethical principles as we wait for the release of a set of ethical guidelines by the Commission next month.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 237, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Bogusław SONIK", "mepid": "28299", "text": "  author of the draft opinion of the Committee on Culture and Education. – Madam President, i voted in favour of the report by Mrs Schwab For the Committee on Education and Culture, the Digital Europe Programme is of paramount importance, particularly in terms of strengthening Europe's leading role in the world in terms of digital transformation and impact on European culture. This first Pan-European Digital Programme will benefit not only citizens, but also businesses, cultural and creative sectors. One of the main pillars of the programme is investments aimed at enabling citizens to acquire advanced digital skills enabling them to access and use the latest technologies. Under this programme, employees will have the opportunity to acquire advanced digital skills during long- and short-term training courses and in-service traineeships. This objective is particularly important for the cultural and creative sectors. It also stresses the need to guarantee access to the most advanced technologies and effective digital technologies, from Artificial Intelligence to advanced computing techniques; Synergies between the Digital Europe Programme and all other programmes covered by the Multiannual Financial Framework are also an important point. In view of the ambitious objectives of the programme, it is necessary to guarantee adequate appropriations in the budget.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to start by thanking the rapporteur, Mrs Angelika Mlinar. Thank you very much for all the work done with the shadow rapporteurs, thank you also for the strong support you have expressed to us. I would like to thank the members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their massive vote in favour of the report on the establishment of the Digital Europe programme for the period 2021-2027. This vote also reflects the importance and necessity of this programme for the future of our citizens, our businesses, and for our European leadership. For the first time, we have proposed in a EU budget a digital programme that puts priorities at the forefront, which are based, on the one hand, on what we have already achieved in the Digital Single Market strategy, but also on a vision, on a very clear ambition to continue together to maximise the benefits of digital transformation. , both for our citizens, our businesses and for the public administrations of the Union. So we have somehow prepared the ground, we have prepared the ground with the establishment of EuroHPC, the joint venture for high-performance computing, with the proposal of a European network of cybersecurity skills centres, as well as with a new centre of expertise for industry, technology and cybersecurity research. This 'Digital Europe' programme is essential. We must act now, without further delay, and give Europe back the tools to ensure our digital leadership. To do this, let us be clear, Member States on their own will not be able to cope with the scale of the changes and investments needed to compete globally. Here, the key word is union. Together, let us put our resources at the service of the common European interest. We can take the reins of this digital transformation and reap the benefits. With this in mind, the Digital Europe programme aims to strengthen digital investments in key areas such as artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, high-performance computing and advanced digital skills - you know how important this topic is to me. But our European approach wants to put new technologies at the service of all our citizens, our businesses and public administrations. The example of the digital innovation cluster network is a good example of how all these benefits must reach all regions and people living in rural and urban areas. Now is the time to take action: we need to significantly increase our investments in the digital future, and this is essential to regain our leadership. At this level, the ambition will not be sufficient, it will be necessary to continue to have broad and solid support, including from a financial point of view. We take note of the fact that today's report indicates that the budget proposed by the Commission should be considered the minimum amount for the Digital Europe programme to aspire to success. Yes, ladies and gentlemen, like you, we are convinced that the 'Digital Europe' programme, the Horizon Europe programme, the mechanism for interconnection in Europe, in synergy and complementarity, will enable us to support and encourage the digital transformation of our European society. It is time to act together, to achieve our goals together and to jointly defend the interests of our citizens, our businesses and our economy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 239, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Paul RÜBIG", "mepid": "2278", "text": "  Draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her I would particularly like to thank Commissioner Mariya Gabriel very much, because she is constantly setting new initiatives and, of course, it is precisely these initiatives that are important not only for our small and medium-sized enterprises, but above all for our citizens, who are now growing up in the digital world and have to recognise that we can actually reflect the real world in the digital world and that new rules of the game apply in the mirrored digital world. The digital mirrored world has become predictable: with algorithms, with artificial intelligence. That is why we want us to say: OK, what can we do to make this world more transparent?  Of course, we need a mapping of algorithms so that people can understand what activities can be done with algorithms, that we can also explain to younger people who go to school what coding is, that you can learn this in a playful way. We need to see aspirations since the first push, where we discussed roaming, and Pilar del Castillo Vera and Adina-Ioana Vélean, and we have all fought to make the digital single market possible across borders at a reasonable cost.  The truth is that the first Roaming Regulation was the starting signal for the Digital Single Market. I hope that we will have a global digital single market. That is why we should also focus more on new technologies such as blockchain or ledger technologies, because, of course, confidence-building measures in the future will be crucial to whether our children are able to maintain their digital integrity in these systems.  Digital identity is actually the most important thing; these are the ethical principles that we find in the real world, and of course we want to find them in the digital world.

We need to reinforce our capacity and ensure that it is widely used in our economy and our society. I think that was the main message when the European leaders met in Tallinn and it’s also a conclusion that we can widely share in this House. We already have the Digital Single Market, and the programme we’re discussing today has to make sure we get the much-needed investment to match the ambitions of that strategy. It’s already important. If we want the EU to play a role in the digital transformations of the future we need to act today and we need to invest today. Already the demand for new technology is growing at a much faster pace in the EU than the supply. In high-performance computing we see that the lack of adequate resources actually pushes scientists and researchers out of Europe. We have an excellent artificial intelligence community, but it is still underdeveloped compared to other markets. Fragmentation and relatively low public investment in cybersecurity put our society and economy at risk while the European cyber industry remains very fragmented. From the perspective of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), this last point especially is very important. Cybersecurity is critical to both our prosperity and our security. As our daily lives become more and more digital, they also become more and more exposed, and the risks in recent years have grown exponentially. Increasing the trust of citizens and businesses in digital communication, in cybersecurity, is an absolute priority for the EU and I’m very happy that with the report that we will vote on tomorrow, with this programme from our Commissioner, this is exactly what we will do.

As the poet Paul Éluard said, the future is no longer what it was and today, failure to include the technological frontier in areas such as those in which this programme would mean an irreversible social, political and economic backwardness. We must therefore be thoroughly rigorous and determined in defining the priorities, rules and methodologies to be applied. Only a narrowand short-sighted vision can call into question the funding which, although significant, is still small and results from the lack of overall ambition of the European Commission's financial package. €2.7 billion to develop a powerful high-capacity computing network; EUR 2.5 billion to strengthen artificial intelligence skills; EUR 2 billion to develop cybersecurity capabilities; EUR 1.3 billion to ensure digital transformation in public administration, with citizens' access and care of services as a priority; EUR 700 million to develop the necessary skills, so that this information generates a significant volume of new high-quality employment opportunities, we are talking about EUR 9.2 billion. Sounds like a lot of money.  However, when we buy this potential investment with what is foreseen by other major powers, namely the United States, China or Japan, we realize that, after all, it is not an excessive investment, on the contrary, it is a small investment. And it is also because of this differential of financial effort that we have to be particularly strict in implementing the programme. As shadow rapporteur for the Socialists and Democrats, I would like to like to see the excellent work of working with the rapporteur, which I welcome, and the other groups, which has made it possible to give consistency and translate into a report strong ideas, strong ideas which I would like to summarise. Firstly, since Digital Europe is not a programme to develop infrastructure, it needs infrastructure to succeed. It is therefore very important to link this programme with other programmes, such as the Cohesion Funds, Horizon Europe or the Connecting Europe Facility. Secondly, it is very important to set a strong ethical standard in the evaluation of projects funded by the program. Important steps are taken in the report in this direction and must continue to be deepened overall in the context of the European Union. Cooperation with third countries is another key issue and this report provides a balanced, flexible but robust response, setting relationship levels and clear criteria for defining winning partnerships.  It is also important to ensure the dimension of convergence and inclusion associated with the programme. Therefore, the fact that each Member State has at least one innovation and development hub within the Framework of the European Network is an important element of protecting the geographical and territorial balance. Data protection is also a cross-cutting trait to the development matrix of the program's objectives.  We live, Commissioner, Madam President, a time of energy and digital transition that is a technological revolution. A revolution must always be guided by values and must have the interests of citizens as a watermark of its development. Deepening inequalities, the perception of injustice and the fear of change have been driving citizens away from the European project. Digital Europe must be a connection program and not an exclusion programme. This week, as the Commissioner well knows, the first 2 800 European municipalities that will have guaranteed high-quality connections in their public spaces under the Wifi4you initiative were known. There were 2,800 municipalities selected from 13,000 local territories.  The Digital Europe programme must be able to feed the new European network of services for citizens and the defence of those citizens; it has to be the embryo of a differentiated digital identity based on our common values. This will also be the measure of your success or failure. We all, who believe in this project of peace and freedom that is the European Union, to cooperate to make a lot happen with the resources we have, mobilizing civil society and European companies to this key strategic challenge, the challenge, after all, of putting the technological and digital revolution at the service of people, the decentrality of the planet, justice and quality of life.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 243, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Dario TAMBURRANO", "mepid": "124813", "text": "  Mr President, president, ladies and gentlemen, i.e. the european Union, the European Union and its Member States are Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to join in congratulating previous speakers and also on the comments on the importance of this programme.

I would also like to point out one thing: in the past, a society and an economy have been built so many times on the basis of certain technological innovations and too often the side effects have not been prevented. Even in the transition to digital we have side effects that are already manifesting themselves in our societies, given that there are some problems such as the degradation of psychosensory balance, cognitive and emotional fragmentation, chronic distraction, especially in children and adolescents – there is already a wide medical and scientific literature – these are problems that will increase with the inevitable transition to digital , which is also a good thing.

In the world of fast-growing technologies, the mastery of basic skills is proving to be extremely insufficient. In this sense, the new Digital Europe programme sets the right direction, defining as one of its main objectives the development of advanced digital skills. I think the budget of the programme is ambitious enough.  However, I am of the opinion that more balance is needed in allocating funds to individual items. I share the view that the target resource for advanced digital skills is extremely insufficient. Financial support under this strand must represent at least 12 % of the total budget. I believe that the mistake in which huge funds for digitisation should not be made again, while at the same time people do not have the necessary skills to use advanced technologies. As regards the digital innovation hubs, which will play a key role in the implementation of the programme, I believe that, in addition to respecting the geographical principle of their allocation, preference must be enjoyed by poorer and sparsely populated areas in the Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 245, "date": "2018-12-12.json", "name": "Notis MARIAS", "mepid": "125069", "text": "   Madam President, the digital economy really is the future of Europe, because that way competitiveness can be strengthened.

But how will there be public investment when the Stability Pact creates certain problems and limits the Member States themselves to the possibility of making funds available? So here you have to make sure that there is an exception, that it does not count in the deficit, when there is investment in the digital economy and especially when it is an investment in order to have opportunities to develop the digital economy.

We send a strong message to our companies: we believe in you, we would like to see our European champions grow. And we are sending a very strong message to our international partners: Europe is lagging behind, but it has strong assets, from scientific research to industry sectors, to get back in the race. It is now time to move quickly to the inter-institutional negotiations and to continue to work hard to make the Digital Europe programme operational and beneficial to citizens and our businesses.

I’m eager to start the negotiations with our co-legislator and I wish to work with the incoming Romanian Presidency in the same positive and efficient spirit that has prevailed so far. On a final note, regarding the programme’s financial envelope, I have taken the path of being quite a pragmatic rapporteur and I did not table any amendments to the Commission’s proposed budget. That approach was also shared by my shadow rapporteurs. I consider that the novelty of the programme will be a key factor in the negotiations on the overall EU budget, and therefore I will advocate keeping the proposed EUR 9.2 billion as a minimum acceptable amount consistent with the programme’s needs and ambitions. If we start reducing it, we will get into problems.

The Programme focuses on five areas – AI, supercomputers, cybersecurity, digital skills and digital transformation of public administration – where the funding should go. I support the Commission’s ambition to finally establish such a programme but the proposed amount of EUR 9.1 billion rather limits its ambition. For example, for AI an allocation of EUR 2.5 billion is planned for 2021-2027 to boost Europe’s economy and enhance society, and help Europe in the AI race with the US and China.  I believe that unfortunately it will be rather difficult for Europe to become the front runner knowing that the US and China have already invested billions in AI and are planning to continue. By 2030 China plans to build an USD 1 trillion AI industry. Europe needs a clear vision and a common European industrial policy on AI, so the allocation of funds would be successful.
