The European Council agreed with the UK Government’s assessment that it is highly likely that the Russian Federation is responsible for the nerve agent attack in Salisbury. We expressed full solidarity with the United Kingdom by condemning this attack and, as a response, many leaders decided to expel Russian diplomats. The EU ambassador to Moscow was recalled for consultations. Speaking about Russia, I should mention last weekend’s targeted airstrikes by France, the United Kingdom and the United States against Syrian chemical weapons facilities. The use of chemical weapons, anywhere in the world, must not become normalised. Nor can it be without consequences. The airstrikes were necessary and proportionate to deter further use of chemical weapons by the Syrian regime to kill its own people. It is urgent that all parties in Syria engage in the UN-led political process to end this tragedy. Above all, Russia and Iran should stop playing games and seriously engage in finding a responsible and peaceful solution. The European Council discussed trade and called for a permanent EU exemption from the US tariffs on steel and aluminium. We strongly supported the steps taken by the Commission to ensure that the interests of the Union are fully protected. If there is no permanent exemption for the EU, we will have no choice but to react. We wish to avoid this route, which is why I called for a dialogue that will bring more trade between the US and the EU, not less. Free and fair trade is one of the most powerful engines for growth and jobs, and we should make full use of it. It is simply in everyone’s interest. Leaders also discussed the digital economy, which is a great opportunity but also a challenge for tax systems. There was a clear understanding that we need to make our tax systems fit for the digital era. A global tax regime would certainly be most welcome, but many felt that it would take too much time to prepare. The discussion confirmed the leaders’ desire to work towards an effective and fair solution among EU Member States. In the context of the digital economy, we also discussed recent revelations related to Facebook and Cambridge Analytica. The European Council called on social networks and digital platforms to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens’ privacy and personal data. EU and national legislation must be respected and enforced. This important matter, together with other issues relating to Digital Europe, will be discussed by the leaders at the informal meeting in Sofia in May. During the euro summit, leaders exchanged views on long-term challenges ahead of the EMU. The EU economy is back to pre-crisis growth rates, which makes this a very good time to reflect strategically on our ambitions. Many of the themes we discussed – like a fiscal capacity for the euro area – are difficult, but I see avenues to be explored. As we agreed in December, the most urgent political priority remains strengthening the banking union and further developing the European Stability Mechanism. This remains my goal, even though I am not a blind optimist. In June we will aim to take a first set of decisions and provide additional guidance on the way forward. On Brexit, the EU27 adopted guidelines for the future EU-UK relationship and welcomed the progress made on the withdrawal agreement. We want to use the positive momentum in these negotiations to finally settle outstanding issues such as the solution to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The UK’s decision on Brexit has caused the problem, and the UK will have to help solve it. Without a solution, there will be no withdrawal agreement and no transition. Leaders will assess the negotiations in June. In parallel, we will start our first talks about the future EU-UK relationship. Finally, on Turkey. Despite many controversies, we agreed that the EU-Turkey meeting should go ahead. I met President Erdoğan in Varna, together with Jean-Claude and Prime Minister Borissov. We took stock of where things now stand in our relationship and set out some parameters for the future. We expressed clearly different views on democratic standards, Turkey’s involvement in Syria and its illegal actions in the eastern Mediterranean as well as the Aegean Sea. However, we decided to keep the lines of communication open. We will also continue to work closely together on issues such as migration and terrorism. Before concluding, let me say a few words about the Western Balkans, where I will travel next week to prepare the EU-Western Balkans summit in Sofia on 17 May. The message to our friends is clear: the European Union is, and will continue to be, the most reliable partner for the entire region, as the biggest investor, the biggest donor, the biggest trading market and the best promise for a better future for citizens. Our summit should reaffirm the European perspective of the region. And, more importantly, it should improve, in concrete terms, connections with and within the region.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 2, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": " Thank you, Mr President, for taking stock of Syria with regard to the Council's initiatives and the positions you have taken.

Donald Tusk hat flächendeckend über die letzte Sitzung of the Europäischen Rates berichtet.

I would like to add, in a word as in a thousand, since Donald Tusk spoke about the summit with the Western Balkans, which the Commission proposed at yesterday's meeting to open accession negotiations with Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The opening of negotiations is not a decision which is the responsibility of the Commission alone; of course, a Council decision must be taken to that effect. The opening of negotiations does not mean that negotiations will begin tomorrow, nor that a date would be set for the end of these negotiations. All candidate countries will be judged on the basis of their own merit and we will see in the coming months and semesters what the Council's decision will be, which I would not like to anticipate. However, we agreed in this Chamber that the Western Balkans need the European perspective so that the tragedy we witnessed during the 1990s does not recur. It is therefore the responsibility of the States concerned to prepare for and make progress. Some have made substantial progress, others have made more modest progress. The future will demonstrate whether the States concerned are able to become members of the Union, but this is a process that will take a long time.

A warm welcome to the European Parliament! Dear Donald Tusk, if we were to put a heading on the last European Council, you would say that we will achieve results again by the next Council. This means that many topics have been retaliated once again. Nonetheless, there are issues that move us and that move us around. On the subject of migration, we have now concluded two major elections in Europe. Voting was held in Italy and elected in Hungary. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats believe that the window of view is now on migration, the most important substantive issue for this continent. We have seen in the election campaigns how people are working to move forward now and to find solutions on this most important issue. The points are on the table. We need external border management, we need quotas to take in people in a structured way in the future, and we need a Marshall Plan for Africa. My group and, incidentally, Parliament as a whole have already taken clear decisions on this. We are ready. We are ready to conclude and we hope that the Council will finally move forward. The second major issue is the reform of the euro. It is therefore legitimate — even if I look towards Berlin — to define national positions. This is quite normal in European domestic policy. But now is no longer the time for national positions, but now is the time to seek the compromise to reach out to each other. That is why I hope that we will really get going on the euro reform by the June summit. The big message here is that, with the European Monetary Fund, we will become independent of the International Monetary Fund in the future. I do not want to be dependent on Donald Trump in future crises in order to sharpen this politically. We have to solve our problems ourselves. Last but not least for the Brexit: We have a strong united European Union there. Thank you for the work. Ireland is the open question. We are all Irish in this regard. We have a clear message to convey that we are behind our Irish friends. And yet the last few weeks have shown that we are partners — on Syria, on the issue of dealing with Russia — and will continue to work in partnership with each other, including the UK, even though we are now going to go our separate ways in the European Union. On Russia, perhaps the final idea. How about we bundle, analyse, and analyse, the activities that Russia is now practicing on European territory? A few weeks ago, Theresa May gave a noteworthy speech in Parliament in London, where she spoke about the influence of fake news, the influence of Russian propaganda. We have reports in El Pais, Spain, which show how Russia has influenced the Catalonia conflict. We know that Russia has financed the Front National, thereby supporting far-right parties in Europe. I would find it exciting as a mandate for the Commission to present an overall record, where we have Russian influence everywhere. To solve the problem, we need to identify the problem. That is why we must be aware that we now have aggressive behaviour in Russia that is challenging Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Maria João RODRIGUES", "mepid": "124737", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, we are one year ahead of the next European elections, and we feel this is the right moment to address the President of the European Council, as someone presenting a leader’s agenda, and the President of the Commission, as someone presenting a road map for the European Union, in the following terms: we need, once and for all, to have a full match between our vision, our ambition and the means we deliver to meet this ambition. This is not happening yet and this European Council was, once again, clear evidence of this.  We should ask whether it is possible for Europe to become a leading continent in energy transition, in making the best of the digital revolution with full respect of privacy, and turning these into more and better jobs. Yes it is possible for Europe to be the leading continent, but is this being delivered to all regions and cities of Europe? No, this is not the case.  Then we should ask whether there is a lack of resources to meet this ambition. No, there is not a lack of resources: we need to go to the new sources of taxation. All the discussion on digital tax makes a lot of sense, and we do not understand why we are still hesitating about that. We need to move forward, because the sources are there.  The first test will be the level of ambition to be set for the next Multiannual Financial Framework, the Community budget, because of course we need to address the new needs of external action. Stronger means, including defence. But this should not be done by sacrificing the commitment with cohesion policy, which must remain strong in Europe.  But let me tell you that the bigger test will be about the eurozone, because once and for all – this is the heart of the problem in Europe now – we cannot have a eurozone where the possibilities to invest in the future are completely different. This is creating great inequality, so we need to provide not only a completed banking union – yes, we need to complete that – but we need to integrate the European Stability Mechanism into the Community framework. This is the moment to move in this direction. We need to provide the fiscal capacity to enable all members of the eurozone to invest in the future and create better jobs. If you do not address this problem, the ground is there for populist nationalist forces to go on growing all over Europe. So we need to go to the heart of the problem, to overcome the eurozone crisis once and for all, and to enable Europe to bring real European solutions for European citizens.

You mentioned, Mr Tusk, how important free trade is. I have one request, and I speak also for the rapporteurs from the other two or three big political groups: we are concerned that while there is a focus on EU-Japan, which is absolutely correct, please do not demote the importance of the EU-Singapore agreement. We should have signed this in the last Parliament but we delayed it on the EU side, and we really owe it to the Singaporeans to get on with that trade agreement. Let us also focus on a trade agreement between the EU, the world’s largest trade bloc, and the UK, the world’s 5th or 6th largest economy. As Manfred himself has said, as we look at the global challenges there will be occasions when it is in both the EU’s and the UK’s interests to work together. As the Salisbury attack and the ensuing intervention has shown, let us also resolve to continue cooperating in those important areas of security and intelligence, because many of the challenges we face are not just European challenges but global challenges.

We still need to have the citizens’ rights completed, because certainly after the Windrush scandal in Britain, we want to be sure that the same is not happening to our European citizens and that there will be no bureaucratic nightmare for them. So on 24 April next week we will organise a special session on these rights between the Home Office and five of our committees involved in this. And if there are changes needed, we will communicate to the negotiator, David Davis and to Michel Barnier what modifications are needed to avoid real problems for our EU citizens. My second point is on the coming Council. As Manfred Weber has said, there are three points needed on your agenda. First of all, a breakthrough in the migration package. Sorry, but the European Parliament has a position; we are ready to negotiate this migration package. It is absolutely needed. The proposals of the Commission are very clear. And so my request to you is: when is the Council going to have a position so that we can drastically reform the migration policy of the Union? This is absolutely needed. The second is breakthrough in eurozone reform; we also need this. The four presidents’ report, the five presidents’ report, the recommendations of Mario Draghi; when will the Council tackle this problem? It is almost nine years after the outbreak of the financial crisis, and we are still not capable of concluding on this. My third suggestion, Mr Tusk, would be that you put the cases of Hungary and Poland on the agenda of the Council. I have here the report of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) about the elections in Hungary. You have read it, I hope? It’s incredible – we can say that – that access to information as well as the freedoms of the media and association have been restricted in Hungary. They are saying there was intimidating xenophobic rhetoric during the election. There was media bias, there was opaque campaign financing. I think it’s time that you put this on the agenda of the European Council. Can you go forward – can we go forward – with the Member States with such a report of the OSCE after their elections? And the same is happening for Poland. My fear – and I hope that I am wrong – is that there will be only cosmetic changes, and secondary legislation in Poland, and that the main problem which is the independence of the Constitutional Court is still not solved.

Yes, very briefly in response to what you said, Mr Weber: dear Presidents, it is good that you have made a clear statement here again about the European Monetary Fund. I have to say, however, that it is a sign of poverty when the stop sign is now set up from the country that benefits most from the euro from the Bundestag faction of the CDU/CSU. The requirement that this Monetary Fund, unlike what the Commission has put forward, can only come through a treaty amendment means nothing more than the need for referendums to postpone the whole for years. No, we will not get the European Monetary Fund like this — not in time. And that's why it's the task to clean up. However, with regard to the Council meeting, I would like to say the following: if you look at the conclusions, then it is also about the pillar of social rights, it is about poverty, about education. And it says that there remains a common commitment to implement these social rights in Europe. However, the monitoring of implementation should take place with due regard to competences. This means nothing more than: in the case of poverty, education, and many other issues, the Commission should be reluctful of looking to see if the relevant progress has now been made. What do we see at the same time? Throughout Europe, people are demonstrating with regard to the European treaties and often with the European flag in hand. Let us look to Hungary, Romania, Malta, where two corrupt ministers are still in the government. Look to Slovakia or Germany, where people are trying to enforce their right to clean air with regard to the European treaties. But Member States say: corruption, fundamental social rights, the rule of law — that is not the competence of the EU. But that is a breach of the fundamental European rights laid down in the Treaties. However, Article 7 is such a sharp sword that we cannot enforce it. I would therefore like to make a proposal to you, Mr Juncker, to respond to Member States' refusal to work on this issue. Specify a rule of law mechanism that regularly monitors right there. Let us ensure that you actually present the annual report on corruption that was once planned, and that does not sweep it under the carpet during the European Semester. Don't let the butter be taken off your bread, present sharp annual implementation reports on progress in the Pillar of Fundamental Social Rights! Last but not least, we are waiting — and Daphne Galizia would have earned this too — for your consideration of the shortcomings of the rule of law in Malta. We'll wait for them.

Mr Juncker, the Orthodox Easter has passed and the two Greek officers have not been released, even though you and Mr Tusk have requested it, quite rightly so. Tomorrow the European Parliament will vote unanimously on a resolution calling on the Erdoğan leadership for the immediate release of the two Greek military officers guarding the Euro-Turkish border. We are asking you not just positive statements, but pressure, initiatives, measures, so that the two Greek military men who defend European policy and European borders in accordance with international law can return directly to their homeland, to the Greek army and to their families. It is not only Greece that is asking for this, the European Union is unanimously calling for it, Mr Tusk and Mr Juncker, and you must prove that by deeds and by escalating pressure.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Nigel FARAGE", "mepid": "4525", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, for Brexit voters this whole thing is a slow, endless agony. We didn’t vote for a transition deal, we voted to leave. Now, I’m not the least bit surprised by the intransigence of Mr Barnier and the EU’s negotiating team. They have got to defend their empire, which is coming under sustained assault from voters everywhere, in particular the recent wonderful results in Hungary. But in the face of all of this the British have blinked, and you get the impression that the Prime Minister doesn’t really believe in Brexit, she’s just carrying out the will of the people. I’m concerned that we’re headed for a really very bad deal from a British perspective. We’ve already conceded too much money, too much authority for the European Court of Justice and we’re betraying our fishing communities. And open-door immigration, the primary reason we voted Brexit, continues with no end in sight. We’re headed for Brexit in name only, so I’m pretty frustrated and I think 17.5 million people are too, but there is one bit of really good news. The George Soros-funded attempt, headed up by Tony Blair and others, to get the British to have a second referendum – you know, the old trick that was tried on Denmark and Ireland in the past – that has now run into the ground. There isn’t going to be a second referendum and we are going to leave on 29 March next year. The historic break is coming, and once we’re a sovereign country once again we will be able to unpick this mess.

The first is Syria, where I already feel unwell in me when large parts of the House applaud that it has taken place, and we all know that it has taken place against international law and even without a UN mandate. If this European Union claims to be based on a common set of values, these important basic principles should be followed accordingly. The same goes for Salisbury. It may be that the Russians are behind this, it may be that the Russians are not behind it. But here, too, a serious diplomatic measure is justified only if it really happens on the basis of undoubted evidence, and not if it is based only on mere suspicion. We hosted French President Emmanuel Macron here yesterday. With all due respect to the way he envores the European Union, as an Austrian representative, I would like to stress one thing here: this European Union is based on 28, soon 27 members, and it cannot be the case that a dominance of France and Germany sets the tone and the direction to which this European European Union will set the tone and direction unification project. I believe that there are 28 and 27 equal partners at the table — from Eastern Europe to Western Europe, from southern Europe to northern Europe.

Europe wasn't prepared to deal with it.

Let us be clear: not only the UK was targeted by the attack; the attack showed that we could all be targeted at any moment. This needed a strong response, and I welcome the united position of the Council. On the Western Balkans, finally let me say a few words on this event, which is of historical importance for the region. Yesterday, recommendations which were benedicted by the Council before for Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to open up the negotiations represent a well-deserved step forward and a clear signal for the whole Western Balkans region, which requires in the future additional efforts. We have always said that the Union includes all its components, and the Western Balkans is an intrinsic part of the Union. For that reason, I again welcome very much the wisdom and the wise decision of the Council. On Syria, I have only two points. First, I think it is important for the EU to cooperate through its security members to guarantee a political solution for Syria and the strategy for the post-war phase.

A few brief conclusions: as always, I have listened carefully to Mr Giegold, including what he said about rule of law review procedures. I very much agree with him and draw attention to the fact that when we presented the Western Balkans Strategy on 6 February this year, we announced that we will present an initiative in October to strengthen enforcement in the field of the rule of law. We will do the same, and I am glad that we already know Parliament's support. With regard to the rest of the Western Balkans strategy, I would like to say that I have no question — as President Macron said yesterday — that we must deepen the European Union and speed integration before further accession. I have in mind — this is not new — that we use the Treaty article, which states that the European Council can decide unanimously on the areas of competence of the European Union to be decided by qualified majority in the future. It won't be different. It is rightly stated in some German daily newspapers today that, in the way the European Union now works, it will not be able to continue to function if further accession occurs. In this respect, we are all called upon to ensure that all possible initiatives are taken on the basis of existing Treaty articles to make the European Union more assertive and more decisive. With regard to the Greek officers who were detained in Turkey, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, during the press conference in Varna after the summit with Turkey, in the presence of Mr Erdoğan, I drew attention to the fact that we did not accept this and expressed the wish that before the Orthodox Easter celebrations these two men who have no evil in the shield, be released. It is ridiculous to say that two Greek officers who have actually lost their way around the border are a threat to Turkey. This is ridiculously ridiculous, and I'm not gonna take it.

While fully acknowledging the importance of the EIT's decisions, I would like to highlight the anomalies in communicating the European summits, the shortcomings of post-EIT information which will further remove our citizens from the EU. It is natural that the leaders commented on the decisions of the eIT in their own countries with slightly different stresses. However, it is unacceptable, and as a top body of the EU, it also undermines the authority of the European Council, so that the entire population of a Member State receives a liar, not even reflecting the agenda, information about the summit. I can say that 90 percent of the Hungarian population still knows about the March EIT, that there was only one issue (which is not actually on the agenda), illegal migration, where Prime Minister Orbán defended his people in a hard fight and defeated the EU's “forced resettlement” partners. This is it: through the government press monopoly, as part of Orbán's election campaign, Hungarians received this absurd picture of this important EIT meeting.

First of all, my sincere thanks to the Court of Auditors for the annual report on the implementation of the budget for 2016 and, of course, to the Directors-General of the Commission for their annual reports, which for us laid the basis for our parliamentary work. I also join my thanks to the staff of the Secretariats and our offices, as well as my heartfelt thanks to all shadow rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs for a wide range of consultations. Seven months of work is now behind us, and I can already anticipate the positive result: the Commission can be granted discharge for the implementation of the 2016 general budget. It is also positive that we have succeeded in reducing the estimated error rates, although in most cases in the area of shared management has not yet fully managed to achieve the self-chosen target of an error rate of two percent. However, even in very few cases more than five percent of the investigated processes were considered to be fraught with errors. However, it can also be noted that many errors could be fixed after corrections in the project and program execution. This should pay particular attention to whether the objectives that should be achieved with the use of the European budget have actually been achieved, because we owe this to the European taxpayer who feeds our budget with his contributions. Compliance remains important, but performance should become more important. In doing so, we must also highlight some of the weaknesses that have been identified in programming and execution. 2016 was the third year in the new funding period, but the implementation of programmes and the absorption of programmes and the absorption of With regard to cohesion policy funding, we were just beginning this year. In order to avoid further delays and avoid the risk of significant overpayments at the end of the funding period, the Commission and the Member States need to step up their efforts and speed up the implementation of the programme in order to effectively create this important instrument for creating growth and jobs in the regions. to be letting. In agricultural policy, new instruments such as greening and the programme for young farmers have far from achieving their objectives. Migration policy and the integration of migrants, as well as the protection of Europe's external borders, are new challenges that require a separate budget chapter. Until now, the funds for this have had to be removed from various other budget approaches. The increase in trust funds and a variety of financial instruments obscure transparency and impede parliamentary control of the implementation of the budget. Care must be taken here to ensure that Parliament is able to carry out its control tasks in full. The EU is the largest donor of development aid. In order to better assess the achievement of targets, however, we need more meaningful indicators than before. The EU Delegations' annual monitoring reports should also finally be publicly available. In 387 articles, Parliament has formulated its observations and proposals for the implementation of the 2016 budget. Most committees have delivered their opinions. On this basis, I hope that we can continue the discussion on this basis, including with regard to the new multiannual financial framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 46, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Barbara KAPPEL", "mepid": "125024", "text": " rapporteur. — (DE) Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger, Mr Lehne. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I too would like to express my sincere thanks both for the preparatory work carried out by the Court of Auditors and for the excellent cooperation with the shadow rapporteurs. I would also like to thank all the staff who have worked on this report. The European Development Fund is, as you all know, the Union's main financial instrument for development cooperation with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, as well as the overseas territories. This cooperation is based on the Cotonou Agreement and the Overseas Association Decision. The main objective of the Cotonou Agreement is to combat poverty, in line with the means of sustainable development and the gradual integration of these countries into the global economy. The agreement will expire in February 2020. Negotiations on a new agreement will have to start by August this year at the latest. The Council is expected to adopt an enabling decision in the first half of 2018. All this against the backdrop of new global challenges that will change the way in which development cooperation funds are provided. All relevant stakeholders are already working on new support policies and a reorientation of the current framework for external assistance. This will also have an impact on the impact and activities of the European Development Fund. The report addresses these new challenges, both in the chapter entitled 'Reacting to the new world, world of development priorities' and in the chapter on the new ACP partnership, which provides, inter alia, that the EDF will be included in the general budget. The financial dimension of the European Development Fund is tall. The 11th European Development Fund alone has a portfolio of €30.5 billion for the period 2017-2020. For 2016, commitments for all the Union's trust funds amounted to €5 billion, €2.4 billion, or almost half of them, were allocated to the Trust Fund for Africa and the Bêkou Trust Fund, which is funded by the EDF is managed. Budget support payments were €644 million in 2016 and €914 million went to international organisations as part of the deeper cooperation. In the area of migration and development alone, 106 projects totalling EUR 1.5 billion were approved in 2016, EUR 594 million were contracted and EUR 175 million was paid out. Under the Statement of Assurance, the Court of Auditors noted a positive trend for 2016. The target for the expired contracts, namely the reduction, was only slightly exceeded at 15.15%. Similarly, the target of -25 was only marginal for all old open pre-financing. The old outstanding commitments were reduced by 36%. Overall, the error rate was 3.3%, which is a slight decrease. The residual error rate was 1.7%, which is below the major threshold of two percent. EUR 14.16 million of unjustified payments was recovered. The cost of control amounted to 4.26% of the total cost. Nevertheless, the Court of Auditors notes that some of the supervisory and control systems are still partly ineffective, and the report, too, is quite critical in its broad lines of funding and supervision, which is in the nature of the matter. Development aid is provided in a difficult and unstable geopolitical environment and is affected by problems such as weak government formation, corruption, social and economic instability, armed conflict or crisis. — which means, particularly in the field of budget support activities, that the risk of diverting resources remains high because of the risk of corruption and fraud, due to the risk of corruption and fraud, to mobilise more domestic revenues in developing countries to reduce dependency on development aid, and in particular: calls for enhanced cooperation with the European Union in the field of combating tax fraud and aggressive tax planning. In spite of all this, according to the Court of Auditors, the audit of the European Development Fund is reliable, as is the legality and regularity of transactions. A discharge of the Fund for the financial year 2016 is therefore foreseen and has already been approved by the CONT Committee.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 47, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Derek VAUGHAN", "mepid": "96918", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, I will talk on Parliament’s discharge. First of all, I wanted to thank all the shadows and the staff involved in the discharge. At the start, I wanted also to say that there have been improvements in the performance of Parliament’s own budget. There was a positive report from the Court of Auditors on Heading 5, and spending was not affected by material error. In terms of individual improvements in the budget, we’ve seen the driver service being brought in-house successfully, and we’ve had lots of comments about the improvements made there. We now have a road map for gender equality. The gym in Brussels has been reopened after a long closure. On harassment, the Secretary-General has agreed to set up a network of confidential counsellors which is welcome. An MEP portal has been established. There’s a new ICT project improving services for Members and local assistants. Work on improving security in and around Parliament has been undertaken and an environmental policy covering Parliament has been accepted by the Bureau. All good things, and all things we should welcome. However, there remain some concerns. There were lots of amendments submitted on Parliament’s voluntary pension fund. We’ve seen those amendments. Some of those amendments were realistic, some were not so realistic, and on this we are awaiting the Bureau’s response to the Secretary-General’s proposal. And on this difficult issue, I think we need to spend a little bit more time considering the options which are available to us. We are also aware that the Bureau set up a working group to talk about the issue of general expenditure allowance (GEA), an issue we talk about every single year in the discharge process and on this again we await the Bureau’s final proposal and an agreement. But as a minimum, the policy should include having separate accounts for the GEA whose seats should be kept, and unspent amounts of the GEA should be returned at the end of the Member’s mandate. We should insist that these are at least the minimum which should be required. We also still of the difficult issue of the single seat, although recently Parliament has voted to have a single seat, many, many times, and no doubt Parliament will continue to vote to have a single seat, and we await some action on that. In addition to that, we need a proper building strategy, particularly for the PHS building in Brussels. We understand it is not easy. It is a difficult issue and the matter of the building policy is made even more difficult by the issue of Brexit. On accredited assistants, there are some who missed out on EU pensions because they have not been employed for ten years. They feel particularly badly treated, and this issue deserves some attention. Also trainees who don’t get up but up-front mission payments is another issue. This seems particularly unfair to the lowest paid, and again, we need to see some action on this. Finally, we need to address the delays in pay and expenses to local assistants. Hopefully, all these issues will be addressed in the near future. I would say, perhaps, just in conclusion, that in the Committee on Budget Control we had a long debate on Parliament’s own discharge, and thanks to the Secretary-General for his input into it. We emerged from that debate with a widespread consensus. There was great cooperation amongst the groups, or most of the groups, and this was reflected in the big majority in the Committee to grant discharge for Parliament’s own budget. I hope later today we will again see a large majority to give Parliament’s budget discharge.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 48, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Ingeborg GRÄSSLE", "mepid": "28220", "text": " rapporteur. — (DE) Madam President, Commissioner, Mr President of the Court of Auditors. Above all, I would like to extend a very warm welcome to the Presidency of the Council, our former colleague, Monika Panayotova. We are pleased that you are here because we can not always count on your presence. But you, as the second arm of legislation, are of course very necessary to discuss the improvements that we want to achieve with you afterwards. We would really be delighted if we could make progress at one point in particular, namely the Council discharge. I am a little confused because I should have taken over Mr Valli's reports on the other seven institutions. I assume he is speaking about the reports themselves, so I can actually concentrate on the integrity report, on the resolution, which is also before us today with discharge. First of all, however, I would also like to thank the President. I do not know how long ago we were allowed to discuss the financial management of the EU here at prime time and in the morning. It's been forever. And that is why I have to say: it is a new experience that you can discuss here fresh and rested, and not only from 11.30 pm to 1.30 in the morning, as is usually the case. I see any nodding. So thank you for your preference. As chairman of the committee, I would like to compliment my fellow Members. Beyond party political ideas, we have always succeeded in finding factual agreements together. The resolution on the Commission's integrity policy has put this normally objective cooperation on a new basis and we are used to this. Nonetheless, we have so far succeeded in presenting something that already has a common breath. That is why the vote today is also very important. There are again, tabling amendments which are a no-go for my group, for example. I am talking here about Amendments Nos 1, 6, 7 and 13, which are policy votes for the Group of the European People of Europe. If these were adopted, then the Group of the European People's Party would vote against it, and I would then also withdraw my name from this resolution. I say this quite frankly because I believe that it is important for everyone involved to know this. I do not wish to use the extensive speaking time to continue commenting on the resolution. I would just like to warn against further tightening up a resolution that is already clear and which is actually to the limit. That's not necessary. We believe that everything is in it—in a friendly tone, without mentioning names, and those who are meant know perfectly well that they are meant. Therefore, it is not necessary to clarify clear things even more. It would only harm us all and would do nothing at all. I would particularly like to thank Mr Valli for his work, because his work will bear my name afterwards, which I find unfair. Usually it's always the other way around. I would like to tell you that I find it a pity that you are withdrawing your name because of one point, namely Brexit — an amendment has been adopted to regret Brexit — because I think you have worked well and you have done a really remarkable job. I would like to thank you very much for this. I would also like to thank the Court of Auditors for a point that is important in Mr Valli's report on the other institutions, namely the Court's special report. I believe that we have a real job here. And when I see that the Court of Justice does have astonishing shortcomings — and the best legal system is useless if it takes too long to get your right — then I believe that we have a common have a task. I would like to turn to the Council again.

It is certainly a great job, where we highlight several critical points and also give many suggestions to other institutions to work at their best. I am sorry to have had to remove the name but, for political needs, I cannot accept that we regret the choice of citizens on a referendum that — as much as I myself may not agree on the outcome — was while always a popular vote and therefore we should never deplore the vote of citizens. As far as the report on the European External Action Service is concerned, I remain rapporteur and I would like to say that the Service embraces important and often urgent issues: but it must still be accompanied by excellent management of human and financial resources. The report revealed the issues relating to the management of delegations, especially in foreign and difficult areas, as well as the management of real estate and procurement procedures. Both points are critical and we must ensure that they do not affect the budget and the proper functioning of the institutions. On buildings, although some progress has been achieved in this field in recent years, there is still ample room for improvement, especially within the rental and purchase procedures for delegations. As for the budget of the latter, it has emerged that more than 40% of expenditure is related to real estate: the costs are still too high. We must therefore encourage solutions such as co-rentals to reduce expenditure and ensure that the procedures for buying buildings are transparent and lead to real cost optimization. It is also necessary to simplify the budget of delegations in order to improve their management and efficiency. At the same time you can reach a level of higher transparency and ensure that citizens are aware of the expenses incurred. Considering procurement, persistent weaknesses in procedures under EUR 60 000 were found in 2016 and shortcomings relating to internal control rules. The European External Action Service must therefore improve monitoring activities and must ensure that the procedures meet the fees required, even in difficult situations. Healthy practices are needed to avoid mistakes and irregularities. I remember that human resources must remain in the foreground: work must still be done to prevent harassment, to promote gender balance at all levels and to safeguard whistleblowers. Finally, economically support trainees and ensure that they have a finally meritocratic internship access procedure. I therefore strongly call for a transparent, rational and efficient budget. The reporting must be timely and precise, both for the expenses faced by the delegations and for the costs of the missions of the members of the Service. In this regard, within the merits of expenditure on the missions of the High Representative: beyond the issues of costs, which nevertheless remains an important point, the node was Parliament's request that costs of missions were published. So far only the costs of missions from the first two months of 2016 have been made public. Documentation on these missions must be easily accessible, according to the requests of Parliament itself; it is an act due to the citizens of the Union who must continue to have confidence in Institutions. I will now leave the floor to my colleagues for their considerations and thank the president again for taking my reports and for the kind words addressed to me.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 50, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Bart STAES", "mepid": "4751", "text": " rapporteur. — (NL) Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Lehne, Mrs Panayotova, I am rapporteur for the agencies, for all agencies except one: the food safety agency EFSA, for which Indrek Tarand is the rapporteur. My work started in July last year after the Strasbourg session. I then travelled to Parma, to the Food Safety Agency, where at that time all the agencies, the Directors-Generals and their delegates met to coordinate their work. And right away, that is my first comment: there is a coordinating secretariat that coordinates the work of all the agencies. That needs the staff worthy of that name. Parliament is ready to grant one full-time equivalent to that coordinating secretariat. The Council refuses that. Mrs Panayotova, I would ask you to ask the Council to ensure that this single post is protected from that coordinating agency. I would like to emphasise very emphatically: the agencies are generally doing very good work. They are needed, and they are also very alert in the work they do. The resolutions deal with the influence of Brexit. For a number of agencies, this is quite essential, for example in the relocation of EMA, we heard that relocation to certain countries would be quite catastrophic. This applies to large agencies such as the Medicines Agency. But that also applies to smaller agencies, such as the agency dealing with Galileo. So that's a point of attention. In this context, there is also another focus, namely the whole system of salary coefficient, whereby wages are adjusted according to the location of an agency. For some agencies, this is a fairly urgent solution; for example, Frontex in Poland cannot implement serious personnel policy because of the low salary coefficient. So that's where the resolutions call attention for. I have, of course, focused on avoiding conflicts of interest in all agencies. Avoiding conflicts of interest is incredibly important. In most agencies, that is in the right direction. In any case, there are no excuses to invent, no excuses to publish, for example, the resumes of the members of the management board of agencies, to provide a comprehensive overview of the conflicts of interest that may be possible with staff or experts who are employed on a temporary basis in those agencies. That must therefore be kept under consideration. The anti-corruption policy is also very important in this respect. I have also paid attention to equality between men and women. We see that more and more women are going to work in the agencies too. Unfortunately, this is all too often in executive positions and not in management positions. You will read in each resolution what the situation is and which agencies really need to make an effort to get more women into management positions. Attention has also been paid to the well-being of the staff. Teambuilding activities, a policy against harassment, harassment that unfortunately still occur within certain work situations. So there are 32 critical resolutions ahead, and I recommend discharge for all agencies except one agency, EASO, the Asylum Agency. I do not want to say that the Asylum Agency does not do any important work or does not do a good job. I think that this agency works very well and that the staff, often in difficult circumstances, under time pressure in Italy and Greece, do so brilliantly. Let that be said. But let us also acknowledge that there is currently an OLAF investigation into the internal dynamics within EASO. As long as this OLAF investigation is ongoing, I believe that we cannot grant discharge, that we should postpone that discharge. We will see, once the OLAF investigation is over, which is expected by the end of the summer, the state of affairs then and then we may be able to grant discharge in October. I would like to say a few words about the Commission's discharge resolution. I thank Mr Ziller for his work. We have tabled a number of amendments to this in relation to problems of integrity. The fact that Commissioner Cañete is taking a voluntary pension from here, from the European Parliament, from the meeting between Mr Barroso and Mr Katainen, and finally Selmayr, is a separate resolution on this subject. I'm happy with the work we did there. We have tabled a limited number of amendments and I hope that we will all be able to reach a balanced choice, a balanced resolution on the Selmayr case.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 51, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Indrek TARAND", "mepid": "97136", "text": "  rapporteur. – Mr President, I am rapporteur on the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) file only, and there is a delicate border between the report as such and the ongoing court case. My hope is that the agency will act in accordance with the Court’s decision, when it is made. Mr Url has promised me that he will do so, and I have no reason to doubt his word. I think that we will do fine with the EFSA discharge report. As a shadow rapporteur on Commission discharges, I would like to bring up two issues. First, we all know that that some Commissioners are getting pensions from the – soon to be insolvent, perhaps – voluntary pension fund. As a token of sympathy and an act of goodwill, I will not mention the names of the Commissioners. But I ask Commissioner Oettinger to ask his colleague whether he is aware of why Bismarck invented pensions. He invented pensions so that, after long decades of hard work, the person who has lost his ability to work will have the means to survive in his elderly days. Pensions are not meant to be paid out to people with the full ability to do an important job. Second – and I am not harsh because it is the EPP Group, if it was a Green Commissioner I would be twice as harsh – let me go to ALDE, and this brings me to the issue of special advisers. There is a huge number of special advisers – with the wrong gender balance: one woman to three and a half men – but the problem is that some of them are former Commissioners. They appear to be lobbyists, entering with their badges and working for private companies during their cooling-off period, ignoring the ethical code of the Commission. When I asked a question in 2015, the Commission failed to answer in time and, again, as a gesture of goodwill I did not pursue it. I appreciate that the Commission has made changes in this particular case, but the rule as such has not been changed. I call on the Commission to look very clearly into this matter so that citizens can understand what kind of advice a former Commissioner, now governor of a small village in Estonia, is giving to Vice-President Dombrovskis on eurozone economies. I mean, why does Mr Dombrovskis need that? It is suspicious. Having said that, on the positive side, I heard dear colleague Ms Ayala Sender complaining that there is too little speaking time. President Sassoli, if you could cut my second intervention by 50% I could donate my minute to Ms Ayala Sender and that would be good, I think, for the debate in plenary. If I can cut my speaking time by 50% I see no difficulty for the Commission to cut special advisers in the same way, by 50%. Send them home, we need them there. Having said that, I would like to thank all the rapporteurs, shadows and colleagues from the Budgetary Control Committee. It has been a real privilege to be in this enlightened bunch of Members.

This has been a collaborative piece of work between Members of the Committee on Budgetary Control, colleagues and, especially, the Court of Auditors for the annual joint undertakings that they produce and the excellent reports that have been produced by the Court of Auditors, which I want to recognise. I also recognise the work done by the Commission; Commissioner Oettinger and his team, in terms of this very important part of the annual budget. The discharge procedure is an important procedure. First and foremost, because it shines a light on public expenditure that we vote through in the seven-year multiannual framework expenditure. Shining a light not just on the expenditure itself, but shining a light on the outcome of that expenditure in the various joint undertakings, which do such an important task. Why is it important? First and foremost, it is important because we need more research and innovation across the European Union. It’s crucial for jobs, it’s crucial for growth and it’s crucial for Europe’s fightback after the crisis. So investing with industry in key areas is good for jobs and good for the economy. We are talking here looking back in 2016 and the reports that have been produced by the Court of expenditure of about EUR 1.8 billion in terms of collaboration with the private sector. That’s about 1.3% of the total budget. It is a crucial part of the public and private mix, so the public expenditure – the EUR 1.8 billion in expenditure in 2016 – unlocks much more private expenditure which can then be used in industry for the purposes of innovation and research. I think it is important, and I have said this at the committee on all of the hearings we have had, that we demonstrate to the public what we get for this money and how industry across all of the different facets of the European Union is making a difference. And that’s what is important in terms of the projects which we are looking at. I also think it is important, and this was a key part of the texts that we put through in all of the reports, that we highlight that SMEs especially should gain a portion of this in terms of their work with the joint undertakings. And that’s crucial for the supply chains and for industries right the way across the European Union. So, of the reports we have seven unqualified opinions and we have one qualified opinion. As I suggested at the committee, I am proposing discharge in all cases. This has been unanimously accepted by the committee. I think good progress has been shown this year in terms of improvements on internal controls; an improvement also on in-kind contributions. We are beginning to see some improvement on project completion and the timelines therein, ex ante controls have been improved and the error rate reduction, I think, has to be welcomed in all of the reports. The four joint undertakings we asked to come before our committee were: Shift2Rail, because it was the first year; Innovative Medicines, because of payment issues concerning their lag between where the average payments were across other joint undertakings. As for ECSEL the qualified opinion referred to the control systems, which have been highlighted by the Court, but I think good explanations have been given by the joint undertakings, so I am not suggesting in that case the discharge be not granted. And then the annual questions on Fusion for Energy, which are really around delays in the project. It is a very significant project that has been delayed up until 2035. There were also questions about the decommissioning of the site and the future costs of this, which have been flagged in previous reports. So, I am suggesting, with the support of the House, that we would grant discharge on all eight joint undertakings which have been assessed for expenditure in 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, it is a real pleasure for me to participate today in this important debate on the implementation of the EU budget for the financial year 2016 in the context of the annual discharge procedure, as foreseen in Article 319 of the Treaty. The efficient use of EU funds in full respect of the principle of sound financial management is of utmost importance. The delivery of good results is particularly important. Indeed, it reassures citizens that every single euro spent on an action financed by the EU budget is spent properly and effectively. I would like to respond to the question of Ms Gräßle, I would like to confirm that the preparatory bodies have examined how we can progress on the EP proposal for a procedure of cooperation between our two institutions during the discharge procedure. The Council will soon adopt a mandate to start the discussions with the European Parliament. On 26 February, my colleague, Bulgarian Deputy Minister of Finance, Ms Petrova, has had the honour of presenting the Council recommendation to grant discharge to the Commission in front of the Committee on Budgetary Control. Tomorrow, I believe this plenary will confirm the vote of the committee and grant discharge to the Commission. I am glad to note that the European Parliament and the Council are able to agree on this important issue. The Council welcomes the fact that, for the first time since the Court started providing a statement of assurance, in 1994, the Court has given a qualified opinion on the legality and regularity of payments. Additionally, the Council welcomes the gradual reduction of the overall estimated level of error reported by the Court during the last years. Nevertheless, the Council regrets that the overall estimated level of error reported by the Council for 2016 payments at 3.1% is above the benchmark of 2%. The Council, therefore, reiterates its wish to see further improvements in the financial management systems and in the estimated level of error across all policy areas. One must recognise what has already been achieved and, in this context, the Council appreciates the efforts and actions taken by the Commission and the Member States. The Council notes with satisfaction that the market and direct support expenditure in heading 2 was not affected by material error in 2016. This positive result is particularly relevant as market and direct support represents three-quarters of the expenditure of the heading. But there is still work to be done. The Council calls upon both the Commission and the Member States to implement the Council’s recommendations. It also calls on Member States to continue cooperating with the Commission and to prioritise an increase in the quality, rather than quantity, of first-level checks in order to prevent, detect and correct errors. The Council also stresses the fact that controls are not without cost, taking into account the complexity of policies and programmes. Therefore, a balance has to be found between the risk of error and the cost of control and audit, focusing on better controls rather than more controls. The Council agrees with the Parliament that simplification of rules remains paramount in reducing the error rates. Simplification and improved guidance not only reduces the administrative burden on the beneficiaries and respective authorities, but also allows for efficient and less costly controls. We reached a political agreement on the revision of the Financial Regulation three weeks ago, and this revision should have a positive impact. I would like to emphasise that prevention is always better than correction. The Commission should apply preventive measures, such as interruption and suspension of payments, strictly in line with the relevant rules. The Council also reiterates the need to continue to apply financial corrections and recoveries rigorously, in line with the relevant rules, in order to protect the EU budget. In this context, the Council regrets that not all actors involved made full use of the available information to prevent, detect and correct a significant proportion of the errors. This could have substantially reduced the estimated level of error, bringing it closer to the materiality threshold across all chapters of expenditure. Mr President, honourable Members, let me now turn to budgetary and financial management, and the predictability of EU funding. The Council takes note that the gap between adopted and used payment appropriations increased in 2016. We acknowledge that the pressure on payments can be expected to increase in the coming years. Therefore, we call on the Commission to anticipate an orderly disbursement of payments in order to avoid any shortage of appropriations. The Council is concerned about the Court’s observation that the outstanding commitments are increasing. It calls on the Commission to continue monitoring this matter and to ensure an orderly balance between commitment and payment appropriations. The Council takes note of the Court’s observation on the increasing financial exposure of the EU budget, due to long-term liabilities, guarantees and legal obligations. The Council calls on the Commission to closely monitor their development and the associated financial risk. The Council calls on the Commission to improve the transparency, simplicity and accountability of all EU budgetary instruments. To conclude, let me recall that the pressure on the EU and national finances is still a reality in the current economic outlook. This will require, from all institutions and stakeholders, a more careful management of EU funds, as well as better forecasting of long-term funding requirements. Let us ensure that EU money is used to achieve results that could not be achieved as efficiently or effectively by other means. We have to send a clear signal to European citizens and taxpayers that European Union funds are used in a responsible and accountable manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 54, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": " Member of the Commission. — Mr President, Minister, Mr Lehne, Mr Lazarou, honourable Members, ladies and gentlemen. Mr President, I would like to begin by paying tribute to the varied and valuable work of all the rapporteurs. I believe that we can have an excellent illumination of European budgets through you and through joint control work, so that we can tell taxpayers: yes, we know what is going properly, where we can make improvements, what went or is going wrong. For me, the procedure for granting discharge for 2016 is, on the one hand, a review of the current budget implementation, but above all a guide for the next financial framework. We see your critical proposals first and foremost constructive advice on what can be done better in the next period 2021-2027. To this end, we will present our package on 2 May, and the implementing rules will follow in the weeks thereafter and will hopefully be a constructive basis for you — Parliament and the Council — to invest our citizens' resources even better, to avoid even more misinvestments. The Committee on Budgetary Control has consulted many of my colleagues — Commissioners managing and responsible for larger budget volumes. There were also written questions and we made every effort to answer everything constructively, openly and transparently. We're not happy, but we're happy. For the tenth consecutive year, we have received an unqualified opinion on the reliability of the European Union's accounts. The Court of Auditors found that the error rate for around half of the EU budget was below 2%, and for the first time there was a limited opinion on this and therefore. We have significant improvements in the area of management scored. The error rate decreased from 3.8% in 2015 to 3.1%. At the same time, we have to note that there are also less good assessments. We have significant delays in the implementation of our programmes for the period 2014-2020, and the discharge procedure may take too long. We do not yet have sufficient budgetary flexibility to respond properly with financial assistance to unexpected developments, events — migration, disasters. They are asking us to respond to this. I tell you that the Commission will deal with all your expectations and demands and will also report back to you in a few months' time on the measures we have proposed and taken. I believe that this will give us a chance to further optimise the European budget and the added value that this is to create and creates. At the moment, as I said, we are working on preparing the next budgetary framework for the next decade. Your current demands and the recommendations of the Court of Auditors will be fully taken into account. We are crucially concerned with added value. Every euro invested in Europe, every project, every programme, needs to demonstrate that there is added value. Otherwise, the European investment would be subordinate to national, regional or local investment. We will follow this in the next budgetary framework. We want to give you an even better and more transparent and informative report on our services. We will have to examine the role of N+2 in cohesion policy. And we want to make it much easier, from horizon to CAP to cohesion our rules are too complex, discouraged some citizens, some applicants, require too much time of too many who are busy with it when processing applications, accounting and monitoring. The issue of the agencies was also mentioned. Agencies take an outstanding Work true — decentralised in the spirit of the European project. We very much see that we also need to increase the proportion of women in management functions here. I'm recording this with this. We are concerned about the grade structure as well as in general. We have a grade framework that applies to Brussels, Luxembourg, Sofia and Athens. And we will then have appropriate corrective mechanisms to ensure that only two thirds of Brussels's salary is obtained in some parts of Europe. If someone is transferred from Brussels to Sofia, but bought an apartment here and has to pay it, he has a fixed cost. It's not just about the cost in Sofia, it's about his standard of living, which hardly changes. This has to do with our Staff Regulations. We take note of this. Perhaps we need to modernise and reform our staff statute in the foreseeable future. But I tell you, if some members of the Council then call for further staff reductions, then I am reluctant to open the box. Because Parliament is even more difficult than we are to make further staff reductions. We are now at the lower limit of what we need to perform the task. The issue of commitments and payments was mentioned. An open word on this too: the current budgetary framework was adopted too late. I am addressing Parliament and the Council here. We will present the budgetary framework on 2 May. My request is to take the next budgetary framework as our common priority from 3 May. Because we now have the sixth budgetary framework that we are going to present, and we have never had a European choice between presentation by the Commission and its entry into force. Either this Parliament is willing to discuss the budget for the next decade, and the Council and the Presidency of Bulgaria, Austria and Romania are ready to see this as a priority. Then we can have a adopt budgetary frameworks. I tell you quite frankly: I am grateful that Parliament's rapporteurs have declared this priority. I do not yet see the recognition of the budgetary framework as a priority from many Heads of State or Government, whom I adore. Some people think the later the better. And if we discuss the budgetary framework until 2020, we will repeat the same mistake as in 2013: to adopt too late. This means that we have lost time ahead of us again and again we will not get a stable development between commitments and payments. That is to say, Minister, my request would be — and your Prime Minister, Mr Borissov, is prepared to do so: please tell his colleagues: from 3 May, let us also see this as a priority in the European Council, including among our leaders. Then we can make the very criticism that has come out today, which rightly came, avoidable for the future. Our target must remain below 2%. But I am grateful that the error rate is no longer the only Bible, but that the focus is on success, performance evaluation, value added. In this sense, I believe that between the Court of Auditors, the Committee on Budgetary Control, Parliament and the Council and the Commission, an important and proper development for taxpayers has begun and needs to be developed further.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 55, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Klaus-Heiner LEHNE", "mepid": "2224", "text": " Court of Auditors. — (DE) Mr President, honourable Members, Minister, Commissioner. Also on behalf of Mr Lazaros S. Lazarou, the Member of the Court responsible for the annual report, who is accompanying me today and is sitting behind me, I would like to begin by thanking the Committee on Budgetary Control, its chairman, Mrs Gräßle, and the various rapporteurs, in particular Mr Zeller, and to express my explicit Recognition for their commitment to successfully concluding this year's discharge procedure. Commissioner Oettinger has already mentioned that once again this year the Court gave an unqualified opinion on the reliability of the 2016 accounts. This is nothing new now. What is new is that, for the first time, the Court gave a limited opinion on the legality and regularity of the transactions underlying the annual accounts for the financial year 2016. Claim-based payments have not been materially affected by errors. We expect an estimated error rate of 1.3%. However, refund-based payments still have an error rate above the materiality threshold of an estimated 4.8%. This limited opinion has certainly created a different and new dynamic that has contributed to the completion of this year's discharge procedure. However, it should again be noted that the estimated error rate could have been even lower if the Commission or other bodies, including the bodies responsible for the management of European funds in the Member States, had made proper use of the information available to: prevent, detect and correct errors prior to recognition of expenditure. This alone shows that there is still clear potential for further improvements. How do you know, in addition to its general annual report, the Court publishes specific annual reports on all EU agencies. I would just like to mention one agency, and this was also mentioned before the debate, namely the Asylum Support Office, for which the Court has not been able to give a positive opinion on the legality and regularity of the underlying payments this time. This is due in particular to the fact that there have been problems with this office and this agency in carrying out procurement procedures. I understand from the motion for a resolution that Parliament is likely to postpone discharge until the results of further investigations are available and that the matter is kept in mind. Mr President, Mr Staes has already announced this. The discharge procedure is about looking back. In many cases, however, your comments will have an impact on the future and, of course, the future Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). In this context, the Court has and will make a wide range of contributions to policy-makers on the basis of its audit findings, on the basis of its audit findings, on which they can rely in the course of their discussions. Over the past two months, we have adopted a first series of thematic papers on the future of European finance, the future of the common agricultural policy and research funding after 2020. We are also working on a thematic paper on simplifying the European structures of the investment funds in cohesion policy. We will continue to take up this issue in formal opinions on the Commission's legislative proposals on the next medium-term financial framework and on the main expenditure programmes. We believe it is essential to be able to gain insights from the previous generation of programs before deciding on the next generation of programs Program generation are waiting and getting hit. In this context, I would also like to point out that outstanding commitments are projected to reach EUR 262 billion by 2020. It is extremely important to deal with this issue in the next MFF, and I was pleased to note that all three bodies involved in legislation have expressed a positive opinion in this regard. With regard to the future annual reports, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to take this opportunity to stress that our next annual report will already take an approach that we are currently testing in our audit of cohesion expenditure. For the financial year 2017, we have begun to assess the reliability of the information provided by the Commission on the legality and regularity of cohesion expenditure. This is done by examining audit files and by carrying out on-the-spot checks carried out by the Commission and the Member State authorities. The objective is clear: to test systems and, as has already been said, to carry out fewer tests, but as a result. These work results will also be incorporated in our overall opinion on the legality and regularity of EU spending. We at the Court of Auditors attach great importance to this new approach because we believe that it provides an opportunity to better provide information to our stakeholders, as well as citizens, by creating more capacity for better auditing. Mr. Writer Zeller has just brought this to the central sentence: “Compliance remains important, but performance is becoming increasingly important.” And for this we also need free resources within the Court of Auditors. Finally, let me briefly refer to the institution of which I have the honour of being President, because the Court is, of course, also a member of the Court subject to the discharge procedure. The Court welcomes the support expressed by Parliament in its resolution on several points, in particular with regard to the Court's overall prudent and sound financial management, its organisational reform of 2016, its good cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control and the very important financial management of the Court. Follow-up also in the European Parliament's technical committees, its new rules on official vehicles and the Court's environmental policy. I am also pleased to report to you that we have recently stepped up our internal controls and revised the rules on household issues, missions and representation costs of the members of the Court in order to address identified shortcomings immediately and to increase transparency. In addition, our institution has decided to request a number of European and International Supreme Audit Institutions to subject the Court to another so-called peer review procedure. As of next year, colleagues will therefore examine how successful the Court has so far been in implementing its strategic objectives and will make recommendations on further actions to be taken. This is the third time in this century that the Court has taken up such a peer review and is open to external and independent review and advice from sister organisations with the same field of activity. Finally, we note that this House is aiming to complete the discharge procedure within the year following the accounting year in question. This would have the undeniable advantage — and the Commissioner has already mentioned this — of being able to draw direct lessons from one year for the next. We all know that this issue of timing involves a wide range of actors and deadlines. But as a courtyard, we are of course always ready to use our To do the utmost to ensure a timely discharge procedure, but without compromising the availability of data in the best possible quality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Doru-Claudian FRUNZULICĂ", "mepid": "124790", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Development. – Mr President, first of all, I would like to put an emphasis on the fact that in the light of the post—2020 Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), the Union budget should be a true European added—value budget aimed at common objectives promoting the sustainable economic and social development of the whole Union, of all States. Moreover, the discharge exercise constitutes an important task for the European Parliament, which must be implemented with the greatest political responsibility, having in mind and defending EU taxpayers and citizens’ interests.  As rapporteur for the Committee on Development’s opinion on the discharge for 2016, I would like to recall the Union’s collective commitment to raise the Union’s and the Member States’ official development assistance to 0.7% of gross national income. According to recent figures, EU assistance has increased for the fourth year in a row and attained its highest level to date. While welcoming this progress, efforts have to go much further in order to meet the pledge taken in 2005 and to achieve the sustainable development goals. I would like to conclude by making reference to the use of budget support. While supporting the latter, I share the opinion that the Commission should better define the development outcomes to be achieved in each case, and above all to enhance control mechanisms concerning recipient states’ conduct in the fields of corruption, respect for human rights, rule of law and democracy.

Perspective another has been guaranteed, so satisfaction here we have a big one. The second element: two key programmes for the Committee on Culture — Creative Europe and Europe for Citizens. Unfortunately, there is no such good sentiment here. I will emphasise that the beneficiaries in these programmes are at 11- 16% only, that is, as many as 80% of beneficiaries are leaving with a flourish, without getting help for their ideas, from the European institutions in short.

This is, of course, due to the fact that direct payments are much easier to execute — here we have an error rate of 1.7%.

Secondly, I would just like to refer to ENISA, that is to say the Network and Information Security Agency, and to say that the life and state of this Agency is now a sinner. I will also refer later to the explanation of vote for why I will vote against, because in essence he has transferred all his activity from Heraklion, Crete to Athens, having created additional administrative expenditure. This situation cannot continue, and I am constantly denouncing it in this Chamber. We must finally pay attention to the functioning of ENISA and it must be checked for the way it works, we must look at that. His headquarters were in Heraklion but he has moved all the staff to Athens and now he complains because there were so few left in Heraklion, because he wants to take them all from Heraklion, Crete and bring them to Athens.

The good thing: that, for the first time in more than 20 years — in almost a quarter of a century, I have to say — the Court of Auditors, which analyzes and audits all the accounts of all the bodies implementing the European budget, has recognised — with an unfavourable statement of assurance — the daily and hard improvement work of an administration in order to obtain the highest added value from each euro from the budget entrusted to it by its citizens.

For several months, my office has been engaged with the European Court of Auditors (ECA) on the application of an error rate correction to the accounts of the general budget of the European Commission. My concern revolves around the impact this correction has on the audit. What I have established is this: prior to the ECA audit, the Commission and the Member States carry out audits. Those audits result in corrections where errors are found. In carrying out its own audits, the ECA establishes a gross error rate. Occasionally they come across the Commission’s Member State audit from which they establish the error rate correction. But here is the problem: The activities within the audited sample are reflective of what has happened across the entire budget. Thus, the gross error rate found in those samples can be extended to the entire budget.

Has the ECA been issuing erroneous results, the true picture distorted by these corrections? Until this correction question is resolved, I cannot, and will not, vote in favour of discharge.

I believe that the cost of non-action and non-investment is kept going down in the general discussions. I am primarily a health and environmental policy, and it is precisely in those areas that it is the money that we invest that will help not only to prevent human suffering, but also to ensure that we, as the European market, are also competitive, so that our children and children's children can experience a development that will help them Europe makes it livable.

For example, in Italy, we have witnessed the decision to bring together the air control centres in Brindisi and Padua, resulting in negative effects on the territories in terms of industrial and labour inductions, especially for regions that, like Puglia, already suffer from delays in development. The Commission itself states that the combinations of control centres could be premature and that in some cases smaller centres are less expensive than larger centres. It is clear that, in the absence of a real completion of the single European sky, in which all the intended components are implemented, discrasies and diseconomies are created which sometimes lead to the adoption of choices reckless. By way of explanation, factors that adversely affect are the failure to implement the FAB and the airline's choice of routes with greater miles traveled, in contrast to the objective of the reduction of air pollution. That is why we need — and we intend to prepare — meetings and comparisons to discuss and address these issues.

I may just want to say something very briefly about a few speeches. Mr Funzulică and Mrs Kappel raised the issue of errorability in development aid. We are observing this, of course. But we know, of course, that certain areas of development aid are particularly susceptible to errors precisely because of the complexity of development aid. Mrs De Monte has called for less complex rules. This has gone through the whole debate. I keep hearing, while dealing with the EIB, that I am told by the EIB that interested parties often prefer EFSI loans to normal payments from European grants because EFSI loans are less bureaucratic and easier to obtain. That doesn't make sense, of course. We need to bring this to a common, equal qualitative level so that they can also be used in a targeted and meaningful manner. This is something that is supported by the court. Mrs Kadenbach pointed out that there has been noticeable progress in the error rate, particularly in the area of agricultural policy. This is very true, and this is very gratifying. I would just like to draw attention to one thing, including in the agricultural sector: an improvement in the error rate does not necessarily mean an improvement in performance, that is, in terms of efficiency. This does not necessarily correlate with each other. These are two different areas that need to be considered independently of each other and which we also consider. Mr Chrysogonos addressed the issues affecting the area of home affairs and justice. We have, of course, changed the structures of the competences of the Chambers in our House so that the third Chamber has a new focus of work, namely the whole Home and Justice — Home Affairs and Justice — and will also set new priorities in this area in the work programmes of the coming years. Mr Sarvamaa referred to the streamlined improvement of the relief procedure. I said a lot about that earlier. I believe that this makes sense and that we should definitely tackle this. We are open to finding the appropriate ways of interinstitutional cooperation to speed up and improve this so that we can ideally come to the N+1 solution, as Mr Sarvamaa said. Mrs Ayala Sender and Mrs Dlabajová mentioned the success of the fact that we have delivered a qualified opinion for the first time. I want to say this again, and I did this when presenting the annual report: this is a joint success. We all achieved that together. And if we know where we are coming from, what was the situation ten or twenty years ago and what progress has been made — we are still not where we want to go, but we have taken tremendous steps forward, and that is to the cooperation of Parliament, the Court of Auditors, but also the Council and, of course, above all thanks to the Commission.

The majority of your valuable speeches related to recommendations or findings. There were also a few questions on your part. We will take up the findings and recommendations and will take them seriously into account in our further work. There have been several requests for the agencies. Agencies are doing a valuable job, but if there are any abergations somewhere, we have a certain problem of supervision. Who is really responsible for agencies? Agencies perform tasks on the basis of European legislation and are located somewhere between Parliament, the Council and the Commission. There is no full service responsibility. That is why I have my reservations about strengthening agencies as desired. Or we can bring about full responsibility. Whether Parliament wants to take care of them? This is not really your core task when it comes to the legislative and executive. Or the Commission will do it if Parliament and the Council want that. A fundamental debate on agencies of the future with increasing responsibility, more staff and more financial resources therefore seems to me to be appropriate. Secondly, the pension of a colleague in the Commission — perhaps several — I do not know — was mentioned. I can say to myself that I am getting a fair salary as a Member of the Commission and no pension at all at the moment, either from previous parliamentary activities or as a former regional head of government. But salary and pension — the Commission is responsible for zero. These are the rules of Parliament and the Council. We are doing a lot and some wrong, but for pensions that Commissioners may actively take in the current office — these are your Council rules and rules. Please put what belongs to us in our mailbox, no less and not more. We are very much in favour of speeding up the procedure — Mrs Gräßle and others have called for this. Last year, we completed and presented our work one month earlier than usual for many years. We should work together to see whether we are working together on the legal bases for faster monitoring and a discharge procedure. After all, the sooner debates take place today, recommendations are on the table, the sooner they can be incorporated into active, up-to-date financial management. In fact, we should be discussing 2017 today, April 2018, not 2016, so we want to shorten the process and we are ready to do so — indicated by all the institutions involved.

On the question by Mr Czarnecki – he is not in the plenary but maybe he will see my comments afterwards – I would like to focus your attention on two main points. Firstly, we all share the principles of responsibility, transparency and accountability. So the Council is, in principle, providing the EP with all the recommendations, according to the Treaty, because, as we all know, the Parliament, on the recommendation of the Council, gives discharge to the Commission. In relation to the 2016 budget discharge procedure, I have to underline that the Court of Auditors did not identify any problems concerning the Council. Secondly, I would like to reiterate what I have already said on the request of the Chair of the Committee on Budgetary Control, Ms Gräßle. The Council will soon adopt a mandate to start discussions with the Parliament on the procedure of cooperation between the Council and the Parliament on the discharge procedure. Concerning the remark made by Mr Staes relating to the staff of the coordinating secretariat for the European agencies, I took careful note of this. Regarding the call of Commissioner Oettinger on the message to accelerate the work on the future agreement for the post—2020 Multiannual Financial Framework, I have to say – and assure you – that, as the presidency, we will advance the work as much as possible during our term. The presidency will start work on the proposal as soon as it is presented by the Commission. Of course, the possibility of an early agreement very much depends on the proposal itself and we will do our best to achieve as much as possible, with the close cooperation of the European Commission. To conclude, I would like to say that this debate has shown that we share many concerns. I can agree that an unqualified audit opinion of the Court for the management of EU funds remains an ultimate goal and that further improvements are still necessary. Allow me also to repeat that all financial actors need to fully assume their responsibilities in this respect. The European Union budget is an important tool for achieving the policy objectives that we have agreed upon. We need results, notably in terms of growth, jobs and investment, stronger entrepreneurship and a more competitive Europe. In a situation where resources are scarce we cannot afford to misuse one single euro.

Of course — as has already been said — these contributions will help us to move forward with their valuable inputs, especially for the next budget, and in my connection, namely with the discharge for the European Development Fund, I would like to thank Mr Funzulică. Indeed, it has drawn up the opinion of the Committee on Development on the discharge report of the Development Fund. As you said, Minister: Transparency and accountability are the basic conditions for democratic control, and it is precisely in the area of the Development Fund that the basic conditions for coherence of the Union's development policy with the objectives of the other actors, namely the Member States, international governments, are the basic conditions for the coherence of the Union's development policy. Organisations and multilateral development banks, etc. The low error rate for the Development Fund shows that the trend is positive. We had an error rate of 3.3% and a residual error rate of 1.7%. This is below the materiality threshold and is heading in the right direction. But the error rate alone is not enough, we learned that today. We also need added value and good performance. To this end, it will be necessary to mobilise the private sector more, particularly in the area of development policy, to introduce blending in cooperation with international organisations, with a focus on additionality. Yes — development policy is not easy. You said it, Mr President, special conditions apply. These are often unstable environments and difficult political realities.

Mr Secretary-General, you always answer more than 200 questions reliably with a relatively manageable budget. This means that no one in the EU is as well controlled as Parliament. I would also like to share this with the Council as a quality mark of our work. That is why I would like to give the Council a homework — and I believe that you are almost overloaded with a homework when you look at the many tasks and also the problems in the Council — namely to move forward with the discharge debate within the Council.

Not only do we want to relieve the burden, but we also want to have a say in what is being done in development aid.

But I agree with the Commissioner and others who have said that assessing the error rates is not enough, and we should be able to evaluate the achievement and value added in European spending. So perhaps we should also, in particularly close cooperation between the Commission and this Parliament, start to analyse the opportunity costs.  Let me give you an example: if we were to spend one billion of the Connecting Europe Facility’s money not on the best, but on the second best, of available options, we would miss that very same billion on the right option, not to mention correcting the mistakes cost.

I think there are three issues, as I try to conclude the eight joint undertakings.  The first is a simple message to each of the joint undertakings within our remit: that citizens want to see results – the results of things that change in medicine, in the environment, in transport and airline policy, often innovations where citizens are not aware that the expenditure for those innovations has actually come from the European Union. We need to brand that: we need to explain to people that it was European taxpayers who have helped those innovations.  My second remark is that the joint undertakings must also explain their results within the industry. Frequently, we have industry fighting against another part of the industry – that’s understandable in the context of any kind of industrial setting, but there needs to be an explanation of what people are getting for that.  Thirdly, often when it comes to joint undertakings the expenditure profile is over a number of financial frameworks. So it is really important to take up the message that the Commissioner gave to this House and the challenge he gave to this House today between the Parliament and Council: that we need to come to an early view on the future framework. It would be wrong to go into this constant World War III that exists over a year and a half on the next Multiannual Financial Framework. We need to show, as Europe, that we can agree something, stick to our position and make sure that that expenditure is robust and strong to deliver the results we want to see. If we do that, I think there will be a good outcome. I do hope that the eight discharges which I proposed in my reports will be accepted by this House today, because I think it will send a very strong signal to the European Union and to industry that we can make results that ordinary people can see and understand.

People are concerned about the security of the personal data they share on social networks and digital platforms.  In order to find out whether Facebook and Cambridge Analytica breached data protection rules, enforcement authorities are investigating. At EU level, the Article 29 Committee, which gathers the data protection authorities of the Member States, is following the developments closely.  At the political level, the concerns are real and are being taken seriously. You can see that in the conclusions of the European Council of 22 and 23 March. It has also led Commissioner Jourová to demand further clarification from Facebook about the extent to which EU citizens were affected. The debate here today gives another political signal from the European Union that we are worried. I am grateful that you have asked the Presidency to participate in your discussion on ‘data protection and citizen’s privacy as a line of defence against election manipulation’. The Facebook and Cambridge Analytica case touches the heart of the EU’s core principles. The rights to protection of personal data and privacy are enshrined in the European Charter on Fundamental rights. Those rights are the basis for the new EU data protection rules laid down in the General Data Protection Regulation, which will become applicable in a few weeks.  The GDPR will help to protect personal data in the European Union, as it empowers persons to more easily find out what personal data companies hold about them and for what purposes such data are processed. Furthermore, the GDPR provides for the possibility for data protection authorities to impose high fines. This will discipline companies to comply with the rules. Finally, the GDPR provides for a consistency mechanism. This ensures that the national data protection authorities coordinate amongst each other their decisions so that the European Union speaks with a single voice. The Facebook and Cambridge Analytica case poses a lot of other fundamental questions than data protection: how can we protect democratic elections in times of massive digital disinformation or manipulation? In October 2017, the Council held its annual rule of law dialogue on the topic ‘Media Pluralism and the Rule of Law in the Digital Age’. Ministers agreed that free, reliable and pluralistic media underpin effective democracy, while digital disinformation on a massive scale has the potential to undermine it. In this context, we have all seen the recent, but very timely, opinion of the European Data Protection Supervisor on online manipulation and personal data. The Facebook and Cambridge Analytica case has brought to the fore the importance of protecting personal data and privacy. The European Union has already recognised that importance in its new data protection rules, which provide tools to protect personal data in an effective manner. The silver lining of this case is that adequate data protection is getting the political attention it deserves in other parts of the world as well.  However, well-functioning data protection rules do not provide the full answer against manipulating elections. Other measures going beyond data protection are also necessary for safeguarding the rule of law and democracy. New challenges to the rule of law and human rights, such as increased levels of disinformation, have to be counterbalanced by increased levels of media literacy. Current legislation is deemed to be sufficient in broad terms, but it must be better applied and supported by flanking measures, such as fact-checking websites, voluntary codes of conduct and intensified cooperation with service providers. This is already in place in several countries, as well as at EU level. Let us use the protests about Facebook and Cambridge Analytica to advance the thinking on these fundaments of our societies. In that context, it is very opportune that, on 16 May, our leaders will discuss the need for transparent practices and full protection of privacy and personal data on the part of social networks and digital platforms.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 130, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, your initiative to have a plenary debate on this topic is very welcome. This case is too important to treat as business as usual. It is up to all of us to draw the right lessons from this Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal. There is work ongoing on three aspects of this scandal. First, personal data. Up to 2.7 million Europeans could have been affected by this scandal. Second, broader effects on our democratic processes, elections included. Third, the criminal aspects of the case. I would like to share with you some details about the different aspects. Let me start with data protection. It has been said that the way we deal with privacy is the defining fundamental rights issue of our time. The Facebook-Cambridge Analytica case shows that protection of personal data can have a major impact on our democracy and on our elections. In this House, you have known the importance of these issues for many years and have adopted the data protection package, the so-called the General Data Protection Regulation, known under the acronym of GDPR. We Europeans have got this right. We have foreseen that cases like this might happen and we wanted to be well-equipped. If there is one positive thing coming out of this crisis, it is the awareness about the importance of personal data protection that has been generated among ordinary citizens in Europe and around the world. All around the world, democratic countries are now looking at GDPR for inspiration. The GDPR basically gives back control of personal data to the people. For instance, consent under the GDPR must be given by a clear and affirmative action and cannot be hidden among legalistic terms and conditions that nobody ever reads. Otherwise, you have the right to take your data with you when moving to another provider. Also, the GDPR reinforces the role of national protection authorities and gives them the possibility to impose quite dramatically high fines. The proposed e-privacy regulation further specifies the transparency requirements for browsers and apps, but aside from this positive effect, there is a serious situation which must be investigated and which must be prevented from occurring again. And let’s keep in mind that the GDPR is not in place yet, so we are assessing the Facebook scandal against the currently existing laws. There is an investigation led by the UK’s data protection authority, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO). I am in close touch with the ICO Commissioner and I have expressed my full support in her work. I expect Facebook to cooperate fully and at the highest level of the company. There is no time to be complacent about this. I am also in frequent contact with the Chairwoman of the Article 29 Working Party and the future Chair of the European Data Protection Board, Ms Andrea Jelinek. All EU data protection authorities met in Brussels last week, and I am pleased they decided to launch a dedicated working group to social media, not only Facebook. On 25 May when GDPR becomes applicable, it is absolutely crucial that those business models that monitor huge amounts of our personal data are under full scrutiny. The time for leniency is over, and it is good that the data protection authorities are getting ready for it. I am fully confident that European enforcers will make sure that Facebook fixes the mistakes and complies with the new data protection laws. Now it is very important that we offer help to those almost three million citizens affected by the scandal. The data protection authorities issued information last week about how their interest is protected and what they can do to ensure better protection of their privacy. Finally, I was directly in contact with Facebook and I spoke to the Chief Operating Officer, Ms Sheryl Sandberg last week. I underlined that I expect Facebook to provide more detailed information and to cooperate fully with the Irish and British data protection authorities. We must better and fully understand not only what happened to the data of EU citizens, but what is going on with this date even now. Of particular concern to me is the information to European citizens affected by the scandal. I was told that Facebook has started to inform people last week. Facebook also confirm that there could be more apps that harvested the personal data of users and those of their friends. I am also getting information from another source from the British ICO. So I urged Facebook to take all necessary steps to mitigate any potential negative consequences for users in the future. I have also advised Ms Sandberg that Mr Zuckerberg should accept the invitation of the European Parliament to appear in front of the responsible committees, and Vice-President Ansip met with Mr Zuckerberg in Silicon Valley yesterday, and the Facebook CEO reconfirmed his will to cooperate closely with the European authorities on rebuilding trust after this scandal. Vice-President Ansip referred to the invitation by the European Parliament as a measure of rebuilding the trust. We also have to speak seriously about the impact this scandal might have on our democratic societies. By having access to personal information it seems that it was possible for various actors to micro-target citizens and help spread fake news and propaganda. And this was all done in the maze of digital reality with zero transparency and without any consent from the users. This scandal is a wake-up call for all of us to start a serious debate on what role social media plays today, and what role they should play in our elections in the future. Traditional media are under very strict rules. Social media largely cooperate without any limits in this respect. And to be absolutely clear, social media created unprecedented opportunities to engage in a political debate and communicate directly with millions of voters, but they also created opportunities for some actors to manipulate and abuse social media. The algorithms used in the business model of Facebook or other companies may have facilitated the spreading of fake news and untruthful posts and reinforced so-called ‘filter bubbles’ and the antagonisation within this society. So we need to understand better what the current situation in Europe is. Organising elections is largely in the remit of the Member States. However, as a Commissioner responsible for Union citizenship rights, I have invited the EU electoral authorities for a meeting at the end of April. I would like to hear from them how they handle social media and online advertising in their campaign rules. To that end, we have sent them a set of detailed questions in advance, so I hope I will get very concrete and clear answers on 25 April. I would like for all of us to act responsibly and not to jump the gun. Our response should not only be about Facebook. Our response should take into account the wider implications of an unregulated internet. Some steps have already been taken. As you might know, the Commission has initiated a code of conduct on hate speech such as racism and xenophobia, which has shown good results. We adopted in February a recommendation on combating illegal content online. We will present next week a communication on how to tackle online disinformation, calling for more transparency, the promotion of diversity of information and credibility of information online. This will be a first opportunity to refer to the very first lessons to draw from the scandal in the official policy paper. We will also adopt a communication on artificial intelligence, which, among other actions, aims at debating and developing ethical principles in this respect. The Commission is carrying out a pilot project requested by the European Parliament on algorithmic awareness-building, which will focus on how algorithms can shape, filter or personalise information flows that may reinforce biases. And last week, the Commission proposed the new deal for consumers package, which includes collective actions in case of mass harm situations. This can also be a strong enforcement tool in case of privacy violations. Finally, there are the important criminal law investigations in this case which need to be carried out by the national law enforcement bodies. To conclude, what is guiding our work in the Commission is a strong notion that the internet is not a space free of the rule of law. The rules that apply offline also need to be fully respected in the online world, and we need to make sure our modern data protection laws are thoroughly applied. I look forward to hearing your views today and to continue working together on these important issues for our society.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 131, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Esteban GONZÁLEZ PONS", "mepid": "125027", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (ES) Mr President, the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica case is just the tip of the iceberg.

As legislators, we must protect our citizens from the abuse of privacy, but we must also ensure the safety of our citizens. The right to privacy should not be an absolute right. Today we see very clearly that terrorists too often slip through the net by abusing the right to privacy. Investigating judges complain that they often chase after the facts. For example, they cannot access stored data such as WhatsApp messages in which terrorists discuss attacks. The right to privacy allows these terrorists to continue their criminal activities anonymously and impunished. This is an unintended and undesirable side effect of the right to privacy. That is why we need to strive for a more balanced balance between privacy and security. It cannot be the intention of protecting one another to be nullified.

There are actually more users here than in the US, and I think Zuckerberg should be here. We should not be visiting him in the United States. He should be here. But today’s debate is not about Facebook. The European Parliament, yes, and also the European Data Protection authorities will scrutinise very closely whether the new Facebook privacy arrangements are compliant with all EU legislation, but we also need to take a very critical look at ourselves. We talk the talk, but do we also walk the walk, Commission, Council and dear friends? Because amongst those who are voicing their outrage at Facebook are many who have consistently voted against stricter privacy protection, and continue to do so. Like those – including the President of this House, dear friends – who summoned Mr Zuckerberg to the European Parliament, but they voted against e-privacy, so a bit of consistency, please. I also note that the European data protection authorities have hardly responded to earlier reports on Cambridge Analytica and Facebook. It has been known since last year – why have they been so slow?

And we are giving away our way our personal data by the truckload, not just to our own government agencies, but also to other countries like the United States, with legal safeguards that carry about as much weight as Donald’s tweets.

Reality is shortened with each click in algorithms, based on software that is decided what is shown and what is not. This way it can also be manipulated piece by piece. Zuckerberg didn't happen somehow. He's not faking ignorance. He knew about the scandal since 2015, and he didn't do anything! Why didn't he do anything? Because ultimately this is also a business model of Facebook to logically make money with data. They may do that, but then they have to take responsibility too. Also Google, as well as Amazon. Therefore, clear rules and consequences are needed to prevent abuse. What we as a group are asking for is full information about the misuse of European data by Facebook. I want Zuckerberg to come here and give us an answer, especially in the committee responsible. I want to know from him how Facebook actually intends to implement the General Data Protection Regulation after 25 May, when that is actually valid. If there are no guarantees, then the corresponding penalties will have to hail. That is what we should do. And one more thing: this is not just a crisis of confidence on Facebook, but about safeguarding fundamental rights, and here, highly respected Commission, you need to take a lot more action, so you really need to push for this to happen. Otherwise, it would have to hail appropriate penalties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 137, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "William (The Earl of) DARTMOUTH", "mepid": "96958", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Mr President, before going any further, let’s get one myth out of the way. There are many reasons why the Brexit referendum was won or lost, nothing to do with Cambridge Analytica was in any way material, and we should not confuse sales talk from an old Etonian with reality. Nonetheless, hidden in this lengthy statement for debate, there is a very important, indeed vital, issue. Let us start from the fact that Mr Mark Zuckerberg is not as nice as he looks. Mr Zuckerberg’s approach to business has been well set out in the feature film The Social Network. And behind all the blather and misleading PR speak about the ‘Facebook community’ there is a gruesome reality. Facebook is a monopoly. It maintains its monopoly by a variety of predatory business practices, and one simple illustration is that Facebook buys up potential competitors. This is what it did, for example, with Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp. But there is more. Facebook makes its money – let there be no misunderstanding – from selling data and advertising targeted from that data. Users do not have complete control over their Facebook data, and this cannot be good. And there is still worse. It emerged in the Washington hearings that Facebook has what it describes as ‘shadow profiles’ on people who have not signed up to Facebook, and these profiles are without their consent. Such data does not get deleted when leaving, because these people had never joined Facebook in the first place. In its methods of collecting data, Facebook has become like a virus that you can never get rid of. This is not only distasteful, it is entirely shocking. The conclusion is clear. The problem is not Cambridge Analytica, the problem is Facebook. And the emphasis on Cambridge Analytica and election manipulation is a distraction. As I said, the fundamental problem is Facebook itself, the manner in which Facebook operates, its predatory business practices, its lack of ethical principles, and its monopoly.

We need to ensure that elections and referenda that look free on the surface are actually so in reality. We built our Data Protection Regulation and Privacy Shield precisely because of these threats, and our legislation must be able to face this test and any entity responsible for breaches must be held to account. We have to examine the loopholes that still exist and how these can be closed, because people expect privacy online and we must ensure that their expectations are met.

Knowledge is power, and power is all too easily abused if there are insufficient rules to protect the individual. We see the consequences of lack of regulation in the current Facebook scandal: millions of data abuse for voter manipulation. Repentant appearances of Zuckerberg can't obscure it: Facebook is engaged in aggressive data capitalism, hidden behind colorful likes and seemingly innocuous apps. The fact that Facebook is currently experimenting with facial recognition software shows how low the learning effect actually is. And yet Facebook is only the tip of the iceberg. The collection and processing of data has become a business model in which we are manipulated, as customers and consumers as well as as voters. In the end, we pay many of the digital and apparently free offers with a loss of privacy, freedom of choice and democracy. Governments, parliaments, business and civil society can now prove that they have understood and act. Thanks to the Data Protection Regulation, from May onwards, the EU will be able to respond to data capitalists in the only language they understand: that of money. Penalties can amount to up to four percent of global sales. And if Facebook then allows dubious apps to wrease user consent through insufficient or misinformation, Facebook must also be responsible for this. But the Data Protection Regulation alone is not enough. We finally need the ePrivacy Regulation on privacy online. ePrivacy protects not only personal data, but the confidentiality of communications as a whole. The rules so far are so outdated that they do not even cover actors like Facebook. This has to change. ePrivacy is designed to protect the content of conversations in private Facebook messengers, some of which have also been read along. The Regulation also provides for specific standards of protection for: consent to personalised advertising. And we want strict technical specifications for the browser to enable tracking only with the user's consent. However, as with the General Data Protection Regulation, Member States are on the brakes on ePrivacy and are becoming a henchman for industry. The European Parliament has had a position since autumn.

Lindsey Graham, the US Senator, asked the question, ‘Do the Europeans have it right?’, and when Zuckerberg answered reluctantly, ‘yes you have’, this was a proud moment for our rapporteur and a proud moment for this Parliament: GDPR had arrived – but, more importantly, it had arrived in the subtle way which we know.

Actually, that's not surprising, because I took another look at Facebook's reaction to these new rules from Europe about six years ago and they said very clearly: “We should have focused on encouraging best practices by companies like Facebook rather than on setting out detailed rules that may be frustrating and costly. Overly prescriptive provisions on consent have an adverse effect on user experience. An overly prescriptive nature of regulation on data-based notification creates a level of bureaucracy that only distracts”. That's Facebook as we know it. Not too much hassle, not too many rules, good money. But now Mark Zuckerberg has said sorry and had a wonderful advertisement placed in European newspapers in which he advertises the same rules.

Never before has it been emphasised with such respect as the Data Protection Regulation, harmonising at European level privacy rules, giving users a key tool, to agree to the processing of data. Although the implementation of these rules will only be assessed in a few months, the European Privacy Legislation has never been said before as a reference for the whole world. Never before has there been such pressure for advertising on the Web to have clear and hard rules, particularly when it involves political promotion, so as not to implicate the internet in the dark sides of a political struggle — especially not to manipulate elections and fund them in opaque ways. Never before has platforms been so strongly required to review the responsibility of content posted there, data use and microarray. What will this chance bring?

An entire generation of young people is affected by hate speech and cyber bullying. A girl victim of revenge pornography or sex extortion must be able to have her pictures taken down. These crimes can lead children to commit self-harm and suicide. Much more also needs to be done urgently to prevent young people from being radicalised and recruited by terrorists on social media.

We have the obligation to do everything possible to stop such practices which we see in this Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal.  We don’t want Europeans to be an easy-to-manipulate crowd. We want Europeans to be people who are responsible in regard to their private data and who deserve protection. I myself removed my Facebook account two years ago. Many people, including my PR advisers, told me that ‘as a politician, you will be dead without Facebook’. I’m still quite alive.  However, there are many people in this hall and also in the audience, and I am sure that the majority of young people here are on Facebook. Again, it’s our obligation to protect them and to invite them to protect themselves, to understand why the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is here and what the new rights are that they will enjoy after 25 May 2018.  I want to say a few words on how our work on this matter will continue now. We will have several inputs for continuation of the work. One thing that we will do is the analysis of where we are with regard to electoral law in the Member States. In other words, whether our Member States are equipped in their legislation against aggressive marketing, a method of targeted marketing which abuses the access to people’s private data. I am absolutely convinced that conducting marketing based on illegal practices, using abused or stolen data, must be illegal. However, we have to check where we are and whether the authorities are able to enforce the ban on this practice in all the Member States. We do not know yet.  Another input will be the results of the investigations which, are ongoing in Ireland and in the UK. There may be some more states launching the investigations later if it is revealed that this practice was used in more Member States.  Another very important input will be how the people approach this, whether the affected Europeans will raise their voices and say clearly that they do not want to be objects of manipulation. I expect quite an interesting debate, not only in the European Union, but also in the United States. If this case could be good for something, it would be opening the eyes of Americans as well, who are more relaxed about their privacy than Europeans. Another input for our continued work on this could be the opinion of the Heads of State, because it might be put on their tables at the May European Council. It’s not decided yet, but this is such a big deal that the Heads of State will want to discuss this.  Based on these inputs, the Commission will reflect on this case in the coming communication on fake news, and here I will have to disappoint everyone who thinks that we will come up with some kind of censorship. This is not what the Commission is planning. We want to come up with workable solutions to fight against disinformation in the EU, and it is very appropriate to include some lessons learned from this scandal in this paper.  We will reflect on this case in the Digital Single Market report, which will also come in May. We will deal with the issue of algorithms and communication focused on artificial intelligence, also to be adopted in spring this year. And, of course, we will take this as a lesson for the continued negotiations on e-privacy. This is all the work we have ahead of us. I will be fully available for continued debate with you in the European Parliament.  Let me thank you, to conclude, for a very interesting debate with many inspirational points. We will work with it, and I’m looking forward to future debates on this Facebook case and on other things related to the digital sphere.

Regarding the remarks made by Ms Rodrigues, Mr Albrecht and Mr Moraes concerning ePrivacy, I would like to say that this is a priority file for the Council as this is one of the key initiatives for enhancing trust and security in the digital single market. The Council supports its objective to ensure a high level of protection of privacy in electronic communication, and we have been working intensively in order to ensure solid progress on the file.  Considering the political and technical complexity of this file and the fact that it takes the form of a directly applicable regulation, it is clear that adequate time is needed for a detailed analysis of all the implications, keeping in mind the overall timeline for the adoption of the digital single market files. The Bulgarian Presidency is firmly committed to advancing the work towards the Council’s negotiating position, with a view to starting the trialogues with Parliament.  Concerning the accent put by Mr Díaz de Mera García Consuegra on a security act, and on ENISA in particular, I would like to say that we are continuing our work on the draft Cybersecurity Act. We are confident that we will be able to deliver on our promise to achieve a general approach in the Council in June, and to start the first trialogues in close cooperation with our colleagues and true partners from Austria. We are continuing our support to advance all aspects of the file in parallel, so that we can ensure the legal and business continuity of ENISA before the expiry of its current mandate in 2020.  In conclusion, I would like to say that the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica case is important both in terms of data protection, and in terms of fundamental issues such as the rule of law and the democratic process. We must develop democratic resilience, media literacy, tolerance and critical thinking, and this is key for fighting propaganda and manipulation through fake news, which threatens the very foundation of our societies. That is why I would also like to congratulate the Commission on its important step in this regard, namely its setting-up of a high—level expert group to counter fake news and the spread of disinformation online. As Ms Keller and Mr Didier said during the debate, it is our common duty and Ms Jourová has just confirmed that we are on the same page. So let us combine our institutional forces to ensure that the momentum for searching for balanced but effective solutions is kept high on the political agenda in the European Union and across the world. As I said during my intervention on 16 May in Sofia, the Heads of State and Government plan to discuss the need for social networks and digital platforms to guarantee transparent practices and full protection of citizens’ privacy and personal data. The Council will continue to follow this debate very closely, and I can assure Members that I paid particular attention to the views expressed here today during this debate.

First of all because while in this period of collective hysteria around so-called populism or so-called “fake news”, mastincated with an anti-Trumpism which is based on the act of faith within the European institutions, it is necessary to have the honesty to recognise the generalisation of the exploitation of personal data for political or commercial purposes. It is indeed Barack Obama's campaign, with the application “Obama for America”, downloaded by about a million users, that inaugurated the micro-targeting technique on a large scale. Secondly, because this case broke out while Europe is lowering custody.

Thieves love darkness. If someone imagines stealing an apartment, most likely, the person or those people will wait overnight, wait for the darkness, when they can go into your property without notice and pick up what they need. In a similar way, those people who want to launder illicit funds (I'm talking about so-called money launderers) also love such darkness, and their darkness in the financial world is called anonymity. If we want to take action against money laundering, money laundering in the European banking system, we must take action against that anonymity. And that, colleagues, is exactly what we've done in this directive. Here I must say thank you first of all Judith Sargentini for very good cooperation over several years both on the development of the Fourth Directive and on the development of the Fifth Directive. Similarly, the other colleagues with whom I have had the honour and pleasure to work together, of course, also the Council of the EU, the representatives of the Member States, with whom we have come to a good result in a rather long and sufficiently complex process. And what, then, is the basis of this result? We have developed a number of, one might say, weapons that will help in law prevent the risk of money laundering in Europe's financial banking sector. First, we have a register of true beneficiaries, where the names of the persons of the owners of the firms are presented, the surnames of which are identified, who stands behind which company, and this register will be fully public in the future. Similarly, we have established a register of true beneficiaries affecting trust owners. We also have a register of bank account holders within the European Union, as well as a bank safe deposit box holder register within the European Union. All this is aimed at getting banks to know who their clients are, so that the journalist and the public can track who stands behind which company to be able to make sure that the cash flows passing through European banks are legal cash flows, that this is not money, which including could be used to finance terrorism. In this Directive, we have envisaged one innovation that is being trialled for the first time in Europe: it is the regulation that affects cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin and other popular cryptocurrencies. What's the challenge? The challenge that these currencies, which only exist in the internet environment, are by their own definition completely anonymous. And how can it be dealt with, because of course criminal criminals can also use this system to finance terrorism, among other things. It has been developed that a provider who helps to convert bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies into a euro currency, purchase real estate or otherwise dispose of it within the European Union is subject to the same requirements as banking representatives — to know what their client, and make sure that this money, the origin of this cryptocurrency is truly legal, that it can not be used to anonymously fund terrorism. So in Europe, if we have a challenge in the fight against terrorism, if we have a challenge in the fight against money laundering, our medicine is the fight against anonymity. This is what we have implemented very successfully in this Directive.

For the second time in a few years, we are tightening up the law against money laundering, terrorist financing and tax evasion and evasion. And that was necessary. Just after Mr Kariņš and I finished the fourth directive by Christmas 2014, an attack took place in Paris, the attack on Charlie Hebdo's offices. Then came the Panama Papers and they showed one more time how companies and individuals are making money away from the tax authorities. Every year, society goes missing billions because criminals are channelling money illegally or in an unclear way through a chain of companies and trusts. With these new rules, we are tackling the practice that people hide their assets in a shady way from investigating services and the tax authorities. We see criminals getting smarter over and over again and using other ways to launder money or finance terrorism, such as virtual currencies like bitcoins and anonymous prepaid cards. Tax constructions that may, according to the law, may well be able to the letter of the law, but are morally unacceptable in my view, have been made public by whistleblowers and journalists in the last few years. Think of Luxleaks, take the Panama Papers and the Paradise Papers. They show how letterbox companies work worldwide and the damage caused by unpaid taxes cannot be measured. It's about sick people who are not nursed. It's about children who don't go to school. With us in Europe, but certainly in developing countries, on a continent like Africa, for example. That is why we went through this time and, in addition to the register for ultimately stakeholders for companies, we have now also made a register of trusts compulsory, the UBO register. This way you can find out who really is in control of a company or a trust. I hope that investigative journalists helps and to shine more light on that industry. I also hope that companies will get behind their ears twice before they start another Double Dutch-Irish Sandwich, because they know that society is watching. The UBO register for companies is completely public. The UBO register for trusts is not, unfortunately, but if you have a legitimate reason as a citizen or journalist, you can look into it. Earlier, when we negotiated the previous directive, David Cameron, then Prime Minister of Great Britain, blocked that trust register. He showed up later in the Panama Papers. My own country, the Netherlands, has always said that there is no need for a trust register. But in the meantime, we know that Dutch companies are also advised and, for example, use a trust in Cyprus to commit fraudulent acts. There is a company that is now being addressed in the Netherlands because it has been advised by Baker Tilly Berk tax advisors. That must be over by now. That we adopt this law tomorrow must also put things in order in tax haven in the Netherlands. If we talk about that, Mr President, I must say the next thing. It is not possible that there are still so many Member States that have not applied the fourth directive, including my own country. Recently, the Director of Europol reiterated the fact that Member States are lax in their fight against money laundering. This Parliament is not lax, and I am proud of the result, and I am grateful to my colleague, Mr Kariņš and the shadow rapporteurs who have been very close to us every time. I would also like to thank the European Commission and the Latvian Presidency. We had to negotiate with the Maltese first. That was no fun.

Tomorrow you will take the final step towards the formal adoption and entry into force of revised rules, and I believe we can be proud of the revised rules, which improve substantially the existing Anti-Money Laundering Directive. I would like to thank the two co-rapporteurs, Mr Kariņš and Ms Sargentini, and all the shadow rapporteurs, as well as the Chairs, Mr Gualtieri and Mr Moraes. Your commitment and expertise have hugely contributed to this result. Firstly, the revised rules set a new world standard on transparency of beneficial ownership. By making beneficial ownership information available to competent authorities and to the public as regards companies, it will make sure opaque structures cannot be used to facilitate money laundering. Secondly, the revised Directive addresses new risks of terrorist financing. It will bring virtual currency platforms into its scope and restricts the anonymous use of prepaid cards. Thirdly, the Directive strengthens our approach to high-risk third countries in the area of money laundering and terrorist financing. Last but not least, the Directive strengthens the financial intelligence units and the national supervisory authorities, as well as the cross-border cooperation between these authorities. The result of the negotiations is a very good one: it makes the European Union the world leader in fighting money laundering and financing of terrorism. With the adoption of this text, we are marking an important step in fighting against financial crime. The key aspect now is swift and effective implementation in guiding and supporting the Member States’ action, and during the adaptation stage the Commission will start acting immediately. I assure you of the Commission’s determination to see the rules fully implemented. The Commission is also taking action against those Member States that have yet to transpose the Fourth Anti-Money Laundering Directive, in force since June 2017. Effective implementation is crucial for the credibility of our preventive anti-money laundering system. Finally, I would also like to add that our legislative work does not stop here. Just yesterday, the Commission presented a proposal on use of financial data in the fight against serious crime. The proposed directive complements the preventive measures of the Anti-Money Laundering Directive by ensuring better use of financial information for criminal investigations and a stronger link between financial intelligence units and law enforcement authorities. I look forward to working with this House also on this new proposal, which, together with the revised Anti-Money Laundering Directive, will be a key response against financial crime and financing of terrorism in Europe.

The threshold for identifying prepaid card holders is reduced from €250 to 150 euros, which has become particularly necessary given the use of this type of cards to rent the car that the perpetrators of the Paris attacks escaped. The directive will also have an effect on business as the transparency of the beneficial owners of companies and trust funds increases in order to prevent tax evasion practices. The agreement reached is important not only because it will support the work of the relevant services in investigating money laundering and terrorist financing, but also because it proves to criminals that the European Union and the Member States are tireless in their actions to reduce illegal cash streams.

The 5th Directive represents a strengthening of control and transparency mechanisms, thanks to the persistence of the European Parliament, which has managed, over eight months of negotiations, to persuade the majority of Member States to accept a large part of its demands. It was Parliament that guaranteed public access to the registers of beneficial owners of companies in the European Union, in order to end the opacity of shell companies used to evade tax and launder money. We have lifted the veil on trusts, even if public access to their beneficiaries is restricted to those who advocate legitimate interest, by imposition of the Council. We guarantee more scrutiny and supervision of liberal professionals and service providers, who, as we know, are instrumental in schemes of tax evasion and money laundering, and should not be left to self-regulation, which regulates nothing. We include more market operators among those who have due diligence duties towards their clients, such as art dealers and all those who provide tax advice, we restrict the use of prepaid cards, created better cooperation mechanisms between authorities to facilitate investigations and we have created a list of public functions that designate who are the politically exposed people in the European Union who are subject to enhanced due diligence. All applicants for gold visas and similar schemes in the Member States will have to be subject to increased scrutiny. But it is also important to emphasise what we have failed to achieve, because of the refusal of the Member States, such as the creation of a European financial intelligence unit and the inclusion in the central registers of beneficiaries of companies not based in the European Union, but which conduct significant business here. We have fallen short of a result that could have an overall impact on financial transparency under the responsibility of the Council. All too often, in these negotiations, we have the impression that some of our governments do not really want to combat money laundering, but rather to facilitate it, caught by interests.

Money laundering, as you know, is causing major economic damage to the Member States of the European Union. In Germany alone, according to recent studies, a sum of up to 100 billion euros is being laundered annually. Globally, we are talking about a sum of up to 1.5 trillion euros per year. These are dirty money, which in most cases is generated by criminal activities, dirty money that then finds its way, for example, into the real estate market, which contributes to its hot runs and drives rents to some astronomical heights and thus people out of their homes. That is why my group supports the efforts made here by Parliament. But money laundering is and remains a major problem in the EU. Most recently, this was once again clearly underlined by the numerous money laundering incidents in the banking sector. We very much welcome the fact that a publicly available register of beneficial owners of companies is finally being introduced and that whistleblower protection is being improved. In the fight against dirty money, comprehensive transparency is one of our strongest weapons. But why take a step in the right direction and then stop halfway? Why does such a public register not come for trusts and foundations? And in other places, too, the result of the negotiations unfortunately lags behind the possibilities.

It should be remembered, in this regard, is the very serious danger of using cryptocurrencies: I even think that this is the seriousness of the problem, that one should perhaps think, even, of prohibit cryptocurrencies. And then there is the problem of how to counter the predictably expanding use of the hawalas system, a system that has its origins in the millennial tradition of the Islamic world and which, however, is very dangerous if it is used for the purpose of terrorism. And this is where the report, I believe, does not go deep enough in thinking about new measures and innovating existing measures to succeed in effectively countering what is becoming a big one reality in international finance, with unimaginable dimensions. Even Eurispes, referring to the hawalas system, rightly says that we are facing, and I read textually, “an entire offshore economy moving billions of euros, an informal flow that does not pass through banking channels and that escapes detections”.

I think that, thanks to the decisive contribution of the European Parliament, we have achieved a significant improvement in our anti-money laundering and anti-terrorist financing legislation by addressing some of the limits that have emerged with clarity from Panama Papers scandals or terrorist attack investigations. I think there are three particularly relevant elements to be emphasised and emphasized. Firstly, of course, transparency with respect to the actual beneficiaries of companies and trusts and the interconnection of registers, which will allow easier and more effective exchange of information at European level. We will have full publicity regarding the actual beneficiaries of companies but also for trusts, all those who can demonstrate a legitimate interest including, it is explicitly written, investigative journalists and NGOs will be able to have a level of access which, of course, will also be full for Member States and their financial investigation units. Secondly, with regard to the creation of centralized records for bank accounts and safes, we will have another important tool for investigations and to identify owners of bank and payment accounts. Thirdly, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism rules will also be applied to persons providing services for holding and transferring virtual currencies — it has been recalled — but also who trade in works of art. So we have an important result but a job that cannot be said to be concluded. What happened to the ABLV bank in Latvia cannot be considered a negligible episode and all this shows that the road is still long and we will be very determined to move towards a European FIU system and ask the ECB to do everything possible even with its current powers.

It addresses problems — most colleagues have said — such as risks related to prepaid cards or virtual currencies, or forecasting company registrations and bank accounts, which will be very useful for fraud investigation. However, our weak point is the application of the rules. For example, there are entities required to report suspicious violations that work de facto, so we have seen various leaks as facilitators of evasion and laundering. This is because the financial intelligence units do not have sufficient resources or competencies — it would help a lot the creation of a European financial intelligence unit, Commissioner — or because the national supervisor does not investigate, because he does not have resources, or because of other severe sanctions we need.

In 2016, the Commission presented these legislative proposals to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. These proposals are welcome in a context that has been totally shaken by a number of terrorist attacks unfortunately far too high, but also by the scandal of the Panama Papers. This revision is welcome, as it should allow for better monitoring of capital flows from third countries at risk. Banks will need to carry out more comprehensive checks, particularly with regard to countries on the famous European blacklist of exposed countries. This revision will also make it possible to clarify the structure of an undertaking and trust, by reporting on the actual beneficiaries through the creation of this national register of undertakings present in the territory of a Member State or through the sharing of such information between Member States.

It should also be seen that all of this we are talking about is now a threat to democracy in Europe, in the European Union. Above all, because we have accurate statements that the evasion of financial regulation, tax evasion and money laundering are increasingly linked to corruption, with authoritarian political regimes that exist within certain Member States of the European Union. We see clearly that politically motivated corruption has been unleashed in some Member States, the stealing of money from the European Union by close people and economic interests, and this is about to self-evident link with offshore companies, tax evasion, money laundering or settling bonds without control. We know exactly that, in connection with resettlement bonds, a large number of people wanted in other non-European countries precisely for money laundering or for the promotion of terrorism, have entered the European Union.

The Commission underlines that, in the light of general principles of EU law and of the duty to state reasons, it is of the utmost importance for Union legislation to include sufficient, specific, adequate and legally sound motivation as to the access to the information of beneficial owners included in central registers. The statement of reasons must disclose, clearly and unequivocally, the reasoning of the author of the measure, in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for it and to enable the competent courts to exercise their power of review. The Commission considers that granting public access to beneficial ownership information of companies and firms is justified in light of the general need for transparency of corporate affairs in order to protect the interests of third parties and that this aspect of the Directive pertains to Article 50 TFEU. It regrets that Parliament and Council have considered that this aspect should only be regarded as a positive side effect and does not require citing Article 50 TFEU as an additional legal basis.

This legislation will make cars safer and cleaner and, combined with the RDE testing, will ensure that a future ‘dieselgate’ can’t happen again. We have a unique system in Europe: national type approvals, which are mutually recognised across all EU countries. But ‘dieselgate’ exposed some of its limitations due to the testing process, lack of enforcement and lack of market surveillance. For years, motorists have suspected that the advertised fuel performance of their vehicles was inaccurate and exaggerated. They were a joke, in fact. No one believed them, and ‘dieselgate’ proved them right. Millions of cars bought in good faith had been mis-sold due to deliberate attempts to manipulate laboratory test results. To many, it appears that ‘dieselgate’ affected everyone apart from the manufacturers to blame. Those affected are still waiting for proper compensation, whereas in the US, compensation has already been paid. So motorists in Europe are angry, and they’re rightly asking what we’re doing about it. We should all be concerned as well about the environmental damage of this, particularly in cities with poor air quality. Overall, it has undermined trust in diesel vehicles. This package creates a rigorous and transparent framework for approving and checking the cars on our roads for emissions and safety. While emissions have caught the headlines recently, our new rules also guarantee safety standards. Airbags and seatbelts are all covered in these rules. New testing, too, will ensure that environmental protections are upheld. Transparent testing is essential to ensure that cars are safe and clean. Test results will, for the first time, be easily available for third parties online, who can check and verify results for cheating. When something goes wrong, there must be a capacity to act, and under this regulation there are for the first time proper requirements for national authorities to significantly fine manufacturers at fault. If the national authorities fail to act, the Commission can levy fines instead. That European involvement and oversight is repeated in many parts of this regulation. I am naturally sceptical of giving power to the Commission, but this scandal showed an umpire was needed to renew the trust that is needed in a system of national mutual recognition. The Commission will be carrying out regular reviews of type approval authorities who allow cars to drive on the road to make sure that they are doing their job. There will also be a forum, chaired by the Commission, providing greater oversight and sharing best practice of national authorities. Once cars are on the road, national authorities who failed to do so in the past, now have to check them. Hundreds of cars a year will be checked, with the spread of models and types to ensure that cheating will be caught. The European Commission is also mandated to undertake spot checks on cars across the Union, targeted based on information Member States have to provide on their surveillance programmes. A double-check system to ensure that if another Volkswagen ever happened, it would be discovered quickly. (The President interrupted the speaker because of a translation problem) Vehicles found not in conformity will also be subject to a rapid EU-wide recall system where needed. I started by talking about those affected by ‘dieselgate’. For them, this regulation makes the law clear that if consumers carry out repairs themselves to faulty vehicles later subject to recalls, they will be reimbursed for the costs incurred. Consumers also rely on an independent and healthy aftermarket for local and good-quality service, and this has been an issue for me and I am grateful to colleagues here for their support on this. I am pleased to have achieved improved access to manufacturer information for independent repairers. This makes the market stronger for the benefit of consumers. In conclusion, this regulation delivers a stronger, more transparent system to ensure cars on our roads are safe and clean. It delivers for car owners, for the environment and for manufacturers, with standards fairly applied and appropriately applied across the board. I want to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their work. and to Cameron Smith and Alex Davis in my office for the immense work that they have done.

Dieselgate opened our eyes and showed the need for far-reaching reforms. The EMIS Committee and the Commission’s own investigations revealed the shortcomings of the present system. What we have discovered is not only about Volkswagen. The whole industry operated in a grey zone. Almost all companies bent the rules, some even cheated and our type—approval authorities took their enforcement responsibilities very lightly. We are faced with a systemic failure of the type—approval system in Europe. That needs to change radically and it needs to change urgently. Enforcement of the type—approval framework is the responsibility of the Member States, as all of us know, but the last two years have shown that only a few of them have taken serious action against emission-cheating. No car manufacturer has been fined for cheating so far, and only a few Member States have issued mandatory calls for non—compliant cars. This is one of the reasons I have consistently called for a reshuffle of the whole approval system, more checks on the ground and more EU governance. The proposals that you will vote on tomorrow are a key instrument to achieve this. I have also always supported the Parliament’s request for compensation for consumers. The situation in the EU is wrong when companies refuse to compensate consumers for misleading information on environmental performance. Let me say at this point that last week the Commission adopted the New Deal for Consumers initiative. It proposes legal instruments on representative actions and possibilities for consumer redress. At the last trialogue in December, as part of our discussion on penalties, Parliament asked the Commission to make a declaration referring to the adoption of the New Deal for Consumers package to better protect consumers and ensure a more effective consumer redress mechanism. I have the pleasure of confirming today that the text of this declaration, together with the other declarations, is being transmitted to Parliament’s services. If such rules had been in place when the Dieselgate scandal broke out, consumer organisations and independent public bodies could have launched representative actions and sought redress for the consumers affected. With this proposal, once adopted, victims of unfair commercial practices will be in a position to obtain remedies collectively. I very much welcome the agreement between Parliament and the Council. I am looking forward to having a final deal tomorrow. With this vote tomorrow, you will send a strong and clear message to the players in this sector. I am pleased that the final outcome upheld most of the proposals from the Commission and improved some of them. I am especially happy that the main pillars of our Commission’s proposals were confirmed. They are reinforcing the independence and quality of approvals that allow a car to be placed on the market, introducing an effective market surveillance system to ensure that cars placed on the market comply with EU rules, not only at the time of approval, but also when they circulate on our roads, and reinforcing the whole system with greater European oversight to ensure a coherent implementation throughout Europe. Those three points are really crucial to ensure that everyone involved complies fully with the rules and applies the requirements in a harmonised way. I commend the hard work of the rapporteur and shadow rapporteurs. This was a huge effort from your side and I know it has not been an easy process. It has not been for us either. The car sector is crucial for meeting our EU climate targets so we also need to improve the measurement of real-life CO2 emissions as soon as possible. We will come back to that in the discussion on the CO2 package that we proposed last November. But overall this is a good deal that significantly improves the present situation. I am sure that with the type—approval package, as it is finalised tomorrow, this will be a big step forward towards safer and cleaner cars in Europe. It will also help to rebuild the trust of citizens in their authorities. I very much trust that you will finalise it tomorrow. Commission Statement (in writing) The link between the different EU and national databases (Article 9a)  The Commission shares the views of the legislator that interconnection between the different databases used for type-approval and market surveillance should be ensured. As some databases are managed individually by Member States, successful interconnection will depend on the full cooperation of Member States. The New Deal for Consumers  The Commission is concerned by mass harm situations affecting interests of consumers, as illustrated by the revelations in September 2015 about car manufacturers circumventing emissions standards for certain air pollutants, and sees the limits of existing national procedural means to secure appropriate consumer redress in such situations. The Commission has adopted a proposal on representative actions for the protection of the collective interests of consumers [COM(2018)184] as part of the New Deal for Consumers package on 11 April 2018, with the aim to empower qualified entities to launch representative actions on behalf of consumers and to introduce stronger sanctioning powers for Member States' consumer authorities. With this proposal, once adopted, victims of unfair commercial practices, such as misleading advertising by car manufacturers not in compliance with the Union regulatory framework for type approval of vehicles or environmental legislation, will be in a position to obtain remedies collectively. The obligatory market checks on the market by the Commission (Article 9)  The Commission welcomes that the markets checks to be carried out by the Commission were confirmed by the legislator. It is now essential that the legislator also ensures that this activity is properly financed in particular in the context of the Commission proposal for the next Multiannual Financial Framework.  The status quo for end of series (Article 47) The Commission regrets that for end-of series, instead of an EU procedure, the future legislation will maintain the status quo of a national procedure which is burdensome for importers, vehicles manufacturers, national and regional authorities. The current procedure also has no value added for safety and environment and creates problems for the internal market of used vehicles. The rules on the committee work For Committee rules; the Commission underlines that it is contrary to the letter and to the spirit of regulation 182/2011 (OJ L 55 of 28.2.2011, p. 13) to invoke Article 5§4, subparagraph 2, point b) in a systematic manner.  Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to depart from the rule of principle which is that the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is delivered.  Given that it is an exception to the general rule established in Article 5§4 recourse to subparagraph 2, point b), cannot be simply seen as a \"discretionary power\" of the Legislator, but must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and thus must be justified. The deletion of the delegation to the Commission to regulate CO2 in-use testing defeat device (Article 91) The Commission regrets that the initial Commission proposal to regulate in-service-conformity of CO2 emissions through implementing legislation was not supported by the co-legislators. This will further delay the set-up of an in-service-conformity assessment procedure which is a core element for ensuring that the CO2 emission and fuel consumption values attributed to individual vehicles are reliable. The Commission has included a similar mandate in its proposal for new Light Duty Vehicle CO2 emission standards adopted on 8 November 2017 and calls on the co-legislators to support it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 264, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Christofer FJELLNER", "mepid": "28126", "text": " draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety. — Mr President, The auto industry is not high in course in Europe right now. The cheating of emissions from diesel cars, dieselgate, which deliberately deceived authorities and consumers to the detriment of the environment and human health, has cost much in confidence with little money in Europe, and that is a problem in itself. It was clear when we worked on this legislation that there are a lot of people who are very disappointed in the auto industry. That's why there are many who right now in different types of legislation are calling for new tougher requirements, tougher rules, less emissions. But it's not hard new requirements we really need. What we need, after all, is control that the demands we have already made are something you live up to. We can have any hard requirements, but if there is no controlling we don't know if people will live up to them. That is why this legislation is so important and so good, because here we get control, transparency and felt punishment. As a member and responsible for the issue in the Committee on the Environment, I am really proud of the work we did, especially that we fixed funding to control, because without money it rarely becomes anything.

I am pleased that these solutions were indeed found first in our committee and then together in the trialogue. I would like to emphasise three things in particular. Firstly, it is clear that we very much need new legislation for the approval of new vehicles. Secondly, it is really obvious that we need the same rules in our common European space and the 'dieselgate' cannot happen again. Our citizens cannot be deceived. And, thirdly, it is clear that we need to protect the environment better, but also to think about the development of new technologies and employment in the European Union. We have been working on this resulting form of new legislation for over a year. And the result is a change in methodology, new competences, but also synergies between the European level and the national states. Full-operational tests are being put in place, the competences of the Commission are strengthened and a uniform procedure and uniform interpretation of the rules throughout the Union are ensured. The events of past years have shown that this is really very, very necessary. I am sure we do not need new institutions, but we need a quick substantial change that will work. We do not need new costs, but we need clear rules. And we do not need scattered Member States, but we need the same rules for our common market.

Madam Commissioner, colleagues! I've been really looking forward to this day. For long, we can set a both legal and a political period for the diesel street scandal. And we're doing it in a proper way. Because although we European Socialists would have liked to see even more ambitious legislation, we are, after all, at an important milestone today. With the new legislation we now get, we will have a much more robust system for both approval and control of the cars in the European market - far better than what we have today. Why is it even necessary? Sure, dieselgate revealed that a number of automakers were deliberately cheating on diesel cars' release of the harmful NOx gases by diesel cars. It wasn't alone illegal, it was deadly too! It has claimed the lives of several thousands of EU citizens that they did not comply with the rules we had in this area. That's unacceptable! It's a scandal that they cheated, but it's also a scandal that our system was unable to intercept it - that we didn't detect it ourselves. It was the Americans who discovered our problem with dieselgate. But we are correcting that now with this law. There is far more and far better control coming both before cars come out on the market and also when they drive. One of the new things is that we are actually imposing very directly on the Member States that they have to control cars - not just at their own discretion, but we put some target figures on how much they need to check. And not enough with that: we have also learned that will have to check that we are doing well enough. That is why we also give the Commission competences and the ability to conduct market controls itself. I think that is something very central and I also think that will be part of what allows us to prevent a new dieselgate in the future. But not enough with that: It's also important that we can sanction if we find cheating in the future. With the massive fines we add up to if one cheats, then we think it will have a preventive effect. Finally, we are also enabling NGOs to help us get the market checked. We know it was American NGOs who discovered the scam with people wagon. We are creating a more transparent system with an online database, which allows others to help check for. That's really important. I would also like to say that if it hadn't been for the European Socialists, I don't actually think we would have got as good a system as what we end up having. Indeed, there were many both in the Council and in this House who were not as ambitious as we were.

We finally vote tomorrow on this important file, and we can now say that the EU is reacting effectively to the scandal and delivering strong legislation – legislation that will help restore consumers’ trust and make sure our common rules are fully respected.  It was obvious that the EU needed upgraded legislation in this matter so that there are no more loopholes such as have been used in the past by some manufacturers to bypass the EU’s rules. I am convinced that the trilogue negotiations were able to reach this goal, and I hope this House sees it in a similar way.  Personally, I am glad that this new law will help to fix the system by introducing clear rules on market surveillance, with specific targets for the Member States to meet. This set of measures is, in my view, a major benefit of this regulation which should help to solve the situation on EU roads. It also gives new competences to the Commission to intervene. Both Member States and the Commission can act not only when type-approving a vehicle, but also when the vehicle is in production or in use. There will be enhanced control over Member States’ authorities, both issuing type-approvals and carrying out market surveillance, as well as technical services and other relevant stakeholders. Key now is the proper implementation and enforcement of this regulation.  I am also glad that a new system of strict penalties has been introduced which could be imposed on manufacturers in case they produce and place on market non-compliant vehicles.

I believe that this report can serve as a lasting reform of the whole vehicle approval process.  I would just leave one word of warning, because I am a little bit concerned to hear of plans from the Commission to present amendments to the type-approval framework in the context of the Brexit process. This should be of concern to everyone in this Chamber, because cars on the road today are not wholly covered by EU-only approvals. There is an international mechanism for mutual recognition of vehicle approvals, which is maintained in this report. A common sense approach would allow for a deeper system of mutual recognition here, along the lines of what is foreseen with other third countries such as Japan, under the new economic partnership. Instead, under the flag of providing business certainty, changes to the system affecting UK vehicle approvals would have huge repercussions all over Europe. For example, a Czech car, built in the Czech Republic by Czech workers, couldn’t be sold in the Czech domestic market if it had a UK-type approval. The situation is similar in Germany, in Italy and in Spain, and anywhere there is a UK-type approval.  The regulation of motor vehicles is a success story for international cooperation globally. It has been a success story for European cooperation over the last 40 years. That will continue after the UK leaves the EU.

Unfortunately, the issues related to the approval of motor vehicles and their trailers look different. We have in practice 2 serious problems. The first problem is that the 2007 directive in this area is interpreted in a very different way across the 28 EU countries. This results in a gross reduction in the effectiveness of the applicable Union law. The second problem we face in recent years is the fraud that some car companies have been allowed, especially Germany's Volkswagen. This scandal involved tampering with software and giving untrue information about CO2 emissions. Therefore, when adopting the new EP and Council Regulation on the approval and surveillance of the market for motor vehicles and their trailers, we must answer whether the proposed solutions will allow the elimination of existing serious cuffs for reliable approval and surveillance.

After four years, we almost completed the project of a new eco-regulation — after 18 trilogues under six presidencies. I should particularly like to thank the Presidency of the Council of Malta, but also that of Estonia, for being able to conclude this. We have now actually brought together 260 pages of eco-regulation — as someone from the journalists said yesterday: the Bible of organic farming. I would particularly like to thank my shadow rapporteurs — I do not want to do this at the end, but now — for working together so well. I should like to thank the Commission and, of course, the Secretariat for their excellent cooperation. But I would also like to thank two people who have worked with me all the time: Hannes Lorenzen and also Corinna Hartmann, who have invested a lot of time in making this happen. We can proudly say that we now have a regulation that is an improvement on the current old regulation and, above all — this is very important — it is very important — strengthens the confidence of consumers, but also of farmers, in the ecosector. And this is very important. Trust in the eco sector label is the most important thing we need to shape. We have thus also created a solid foundation for the dynamic development of the biosector in Europe. We can also see from the double-digit growth rates that we are also able to develop the ecosector in Europe. I would also like to comment briefly on a number of points which are very important innovations. We have improved import control: a standard instead of 64 different standards. This will also boost consumer confidence in imports. But we have also left enough room for imports from the Global South so that we do not close the market now. But we also have — and you have to say in this area — the competitive situation of European farmers strengthened. Overall, we have strengthened controls, we have put process-oriented control at the forefront, and annual control is still standard in this regulation. This does not preclude risk controls from playing a significant role in future controls. And we have managed to simplify: group certification — this is mainly used for smaller companies and smaller dealers, including in Europe. We have enshrined the principle of 'ground-based agriculture' in this regulation — with only a few exceptions in Nordic countries, in greenhouses. This principle is extremely important for organic farming. And we have continued our efforts to actually improve seeds, so that in future we will also have organic seeds in all European countries, but also organic animals in the field in the future. The first basis for this is databases in all Member States, not just some. The aim will be that, in the end, the same standard will indeed exist in all Member States. But we have also tried to set different standards in breeding in the biosector, namely that we develop our own right. Organic seeds have different conditions in seed breeding, and we will strengthen this. And heterogeneous material in the future will no longer be subject to the strict rules that need to be applied in other areas. This is a very significant advantage for future regulation. And we have, of course, dealt with the issue of pesticides, although, of course, I have to say quite clearly here: organic farming is more than pesticide, and organic farming is going much further. But first of all we said: we need to strengthen the foundations on which we are even discussing. This is why the Commission is invited to present a report in the next few years. in order to clarify the situation with contamination: Where do they come from, who causes them? We have called on the sector to strengthen its precautionary measures. But the commercial sector is also called upon to take account of the ecological sector in the end. We are now talking about the delegated and implementing acts, and I hope, also in good cooperation with the Commission, so that we can finally solve this part in cooperation with the sector.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 288, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Martin HÄUSLING", "mepid": "96752", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I am particularly pleased to be here and to participate in this debate this evening because in Ireland we have a saying that ‘it’s a long road that has no turn’ and there were certainly many twists and turns on this road over the last four years. I have to compliment the patience and determination of everybody in trying to reach our objective of harmonising and regulating the organic sector. I would particularly like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Häusling and his shadows, Mr Lins, Mr Andrieu, Mr Jakovčić, Ms Girling, Mr Zullo, Ms Senra Rodríguez, and the late Mr Ferrand. I welcome the conclusion of this process, which, in my view, is overdue. A lot of people were reluctant to accept that we could achieve an outcome that was successful. When it was put on the Commission work programme I took a leap of faith in the ability of everybody to be able to reach an agreement and I’m glad that it wasn’t totally misplaced. We should remember that many of the current rules are over 20 years old, and they needed to be updated in any event to reflect the major changes that have taken place in the EU organic sector over that time. We are talking about a very dynamic sector which has enormous potential and one that has been transformed from a niche sector to one that is very much in the mainstream in agriculture. It is a market that is now worth about EUR 27 billion per annum, which is 125% more than it was 10 years ago. So I’m satisfied that we have managed to reach a reasonable and balanced compromise in many areas, which meets the essential priorities for the three institutions. Most importantly, it reaches a stability and predictability, from the point of view of the organic operators across the European Union. The agreement provides the conditions for European Union organic production to accelerate its move away from being simply a niche production and continue on its path of sustained growth while maintaining consumer confidence. The consumer must have trust in the organic brand and in the organic logo. The text on which you are about to vote will ensure fair competition and a level playing field for EU organic farmers, while the assurance is being offered to consumers by the EU organic logo in terms of production and quality standards and these will be further strengthened from this process. The new regulation has further harmonised the production rules which has wiped away the à la carte derogations: it will ensure that the same rules apply to all organic producers and products. Today we have 60-plus different standards that apply to imported organic foods and these will be replaced by compliance, meaning that those who wish to export their organic products to the EU market must respect EU organic rules. This ensures a level playing field between the operators from both inside and outside the European Union. Moreover, the new regulation brings greater simplification for our farmers, something that I have prioritised since becoming Commissioner. For example, small farmers now will be able to choose group certification, which will reduce their certification costs and make it easier for them to join the organic scheme. The scope of the organic rules has been extended to cover a range of new products such as salt, cork and essential oils. It will also be possible in the future to add new products in order to respond to the development of the sector and to the consumers’ demand, providing additional opportunities for our producers. New opportunities will also be created by the opening of new markets for organic heterogeneous seeds, as Mr Häusling has just said, and indeed other plant reproductive material with a high level of genetic and phenotypic biodiversity. This will improve biodiversity and crop sustainability and will boost innovation. Resistance to pests and diseases will be improved and better adaptation to local conditions will be a focus. As regards controls, the delimitation between horizontal food safety rules and the rules that are meant to guarantee the respect of organic principles have been clarified. The horizontal Official Controls Regulation will be valid for organics, while the Organic Regulation contains additional rules to target the specificity of the sector. Opening up to risk-based controls will lower the burden for producers and allow authorities to better use their available resources. I’m glad that we got a pragmatic outcome on demarcated beds, which will give another 10 years to our friends in Scandinavia to protect their existing system. I’m disappointed that we didn’t reach a more ambitious outcome on pesticides. Mr Häusling didn’t refer to this at all, he gave a different version of events to know why we didn’t reach an outcome on this, but we will let this pass on this occasion. As far as you can see, and from what I’ve just said, you can see that the road has been a long and winding one, but I’m sure we can all agree that we did our best to achieve an outcome that is a big improvement on the old system, which has stood us in good stead over 20 years, but needed to be modernised. We’re not talking anymore about a niche market, we’re talking about a very solid sector, and constant growth and export opportunities are increasingly available on third-country markets. We are modernising the sector as we were trying to do with our agricultural policy generally.

A politically cumbersome process with a reasonable, partly excellent result, as with, say, the seed data bank. But there have been a few key deficiencies: Animal welfare levels are not higher, pesticide concentrations do not match the standard level consistent with organic production. This should definitely be fixed. And third, of course, is the greenhouse/land resource issue for the Nordic countries, which for tomato and cucumbers can be quite an unreasonable end situation. We're not talking about general aquatic or airborne breeding, we're talking about the fact that in a pretty poorly 30 degree frost, tomato or cucumber is rooted in normal soil. Hopefully this can be resolved permanently in the future, giving investment certainty to the producers, which they are absolutely indispensable to miss. The issue of foreign surveillance that we had a discussion about, but we didn't get out of the tree for long.

With the new eco-regulation, we are making the European organic farming industry fit for the future. The market for organic products is growing steadily, as the Commissioner has presented. The niche existence in the industry has long since been none. Bio has established itself. For interested farmers, organic farming offers great potential for development. More and more consumers are buying ecologically produced goods. We support all this with the text to be adopted. We have set realistic standards and, I believe, we have also created new legal certainty. At the same time, we maintain the coexistence of organic and conventional agriculture. All this was and has been the motivation for me to get involved in this dossier.

We consumed four presidencies. So we came to a result that today was worth the collective efforts we have led. I would have liked us to go further in the framework of this new regulation, particularly on the issue of thresholds. However, this new legislation carries very substantial advances for organic farming, for the farmer and for the consumer. It will help to strengthen the fight against fraud on imported organic products, which today represent — as we know — 30% of our consumption. European producers will now be placed on an equal footing with producers in third countries. I am pleased that this text now allows organic farmers to produce and use their own seeds. Indeed, this regulation finally opens the door to heterogeneous equipment. There is an urgent need to rebalance the food chain and stop rolling out the red carpet in front of agrochemical oligopoles. Today, it is necessary to know, three groups concentrate more than 53% of the world seed market. The compromise also provides for more targeted controls and annual monitoring remains and will remain the rule. By the way, the principle of the link of the plant to the soil is enshrined, which is an excellent thing for organic farming. The introduction of precautionary measures makes it clear that the contamination of organic products by pesticides is avoided. This is a notable breakthrough. Rejecting the text, as some have called for, would lead to maintaining the current situation, i.e. a settlement full of shortcomings and derogations that undermines the credibility of the European organic label. However, it is fundamental, as has been said, to accompany the farmers in this essential transition to a sustainable model that respects human health and the environment, and which our fellow citizens call for more of their wishes every day.

It is also very positive — and we highlight as very positive — heterogeneous organic material, favoring local varieties, peasant seeds, as well as short marketing circuits and local productions. But we are also concerned about the presence of basic organic foods in international markets. For us, organic farming has to go far beyond the production of organic food; it must also take into account aspects such as, for example, transport generates greenhouse gases and energy waste, and we think that organic farming should not contribute to this. We would also have liked to see more stringent limits than those of conventional foods themselves. And, as I see my time is running out, I'd like to end up by making a reference to aquaculture.

We've taken a huge step back in what it comes to contamination by unauthorized substances. Those who buy organic expect a zero-residue product: they don't want contamination from pesticides or unallowed substances. Then, while we understand the need of farmers not to be penalized if their product is contaminated, perhaps, by drifts from neighbours, we would still have preferred a different solution: to keep the thresholds, to offer contaminated farmers — not because of their fault — adequate compensation and, in this way, give the market the opportunity to aim upwards, to have a quality market that offers the consumer a truly safe organic product, rather than lowering the quality level.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 297, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Jacques COLOMBIER", "mepid": "191510", "text": " on behalf of the ENF Group. — (FR) Mr President, this report has a merit: it is a bit concerned with introducing a certain requirement for traceability of agricultural products.

Certainly, some adjuvants may not be organic. However, we are particularly pleased that it is finally possible to use peasant seeds again, which is a major step forward. Indeed, two positive aspects relate to their use: the freedom and autonomy found by farmers in their choice and their know-how in the field of seeds and seedlings. Similarly, unlike the fertilizer-pesticide system, which imposes a small number of varieties, peasant seeds allow the preservation of biodiversity and natural resources.

There are a number of farmers who are prepared to produce their crops and their livestock according to these restrictions, but they demand a higher price to compensate them for the higher costs incurred. ‘Willing buyer, willing seller’, ‘the customer is always right’: these should be the mantras here, and it should ideally go no further than this. Unfortunately, organic farming methods have acquired an aura of sainthood on the left of the political spectrum, because they imply a reduced opportunity for large corporations to make profits from supplying inputs. Of course, this is in direct contradiction to another aim of the left, which is that food should be as affordable as possible to those on low incomes. A further complication in trying to legislate on rules and standards on organic produce across the culture zones of the EU is that perceptions of organic farming can vary. Some insist on total purity, whereas others are more pragmatic if total purity means a very high cost or no organic food at all. A good example of this is the use of raised beds in Scandinavia to avoid brutal ground frosts, so presumably global warming is going to solve this problem for us. Here in the European Parliament our job is to legislate, which includes legislation on agricultural matters. In the last few years, I’ve witnessed a very determined effort here to ban various synthetic pesticides from being used. This is done in the name of safety for human health and safety for the environment. However, this zeal fades away when the debate turns to naturally occurring pesticides. One of these, used by organic farmers, is copper sulphate, a material that is highly toxic, may cause cancer and is known to damage fertility and human organs. These are the wonders it does for human health, but the environment doesn’t get away unscathed either, because copper sulphate is bio- accumulant that slowly builds up in the soil. Strangely, the Commission has just re-approved its use in organic farming. Commissioner, as you’re here I think we can have a deal, because if you are going to approve copper sulphate for use by organic farmers, I really feel you should be able to approve the use of neonicotinoid seed dressings for use on crops that do not flower before they’re harvested. Do we have a deal here? One of the difficulties in legislating in this area is a prejudiced assumption that if a material is natural, it follows that it must be good. Those of us who dwell in the countryside are keenly aware of the dangers of ergot, deadly nightshade, ragwort and hemlock. Another anomaly in trying to set a standard across the European Union is the underlying assumption that organic produce will be traded across the EU. Why have common rules otherwise?  However, if you talk to organic organisations, they want to promote local food; they talk about ‘air miles’ in a negative way, so we have another contradiction here. During my eight years here, I have heard all sorts of dire warnings about GM crops and factory farming, but the two big crises were horsemeat described as beef and, of course, 31 people tragically dying from eating organically grown bean sprouts.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Eurosceptic conservatives"}, {"id": 304, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Daniel BUDA", "mepid": "125012", "text": " — Mr President, Commissioner, organic production is the invaluable resource of health for citizens and the environment, which must find an important place in the new Common Agricultural Policy and which must be protected by the European Union through effective mechanisms that guarantee high standards in this area.

How can we strengthen them while at the same time safeguarding their competitive position? In short, how do we make bioproduction interesting? In any case, this report provides for a number of interesting spearheads and also a pioneering innovation: at last, farmers will be able to produce mixed production. Provided that the activities remain clearly separate, traditional agriculture will be allowed to be combined with organic farming. Farmers can therefore make the transition gradually.

I also want to take the opportunity to thank the Estonian and Maltese Presidencies, as others have done, for their great work. My sense, having listened to the debate, is that there is broad support for the compromise agreement that has been reached by the three institutions. As Mr Andrieu and Mr Lins noted, this compromise is the fruit of four years of work and eighteen trilogues. So it is inevitable that such a compromise doesn’t satisfy everybody because you will have views stretching from Mr Agnew’s views to Mr De Castro’s views and other views as well which have to be satisfied as much as possible. However, this outcome is, as I said earlier, a reasonable one. Otherwise, we would have thrown away all the good work and all of the progress we’ve made over those four years, and I don’t think that would be a responsible way to act. This brings about much needed improvement in the regulatory environment and framework for organic production in Europe. It shouldn’t be forgotten that the reason why this Commission proposal was originally brought forward by my predecessor Mr Ciolos was because there was a scandal associated with the imports of organic materials into some of our Member States in the European Union which was concealed for a long time. This imported organic produce had the potential to damage the organic sector in Europe. This was the backdrop to more ambitious proposal originally brought forward by the Commission. Whatever one’s view about the desired level of ambition, there can be little or no doubt that the text now on the table represents a lot of progress. I reject therefore, Mr Zullo’s criticisms. In particular, I reject any suggestion that the Commission yielded to any interest. You can point the finger somewhere else; we didn’t yield to any interest, whether from northern Europe or from anywhere else. What the Commission did was to engage in good faith in this democratic process with the Members of this House and the Council, and the outcome on which you will vote tomorrow is the result of that progress. The potential of the organic sector has yet to be fully realised. This legislation can help, as Mr Jakovčić said, by providing harmonisation, simplification and standardisation, which is contrary to the claim made by Ms Noichl. As the sector grows, I hope that the European Union can become an exporter of organic products, which need not, as Mr Viegas suggested, be a threat to the sector. Your rapporteur and his colleagues have done a good job in bringing about a lot of improvements in the sector and we have a balanced outcome I feel that we can deliver for our organic sectors in the future, and our organic farmers in particular. We have a legal text which can only help the organic sector.

There are no more controversial discussions here on two points: the fact that we have made substantial progress on seeds is clear to all consensus. The fact that we standardise the import rules and thus also make them a little safer is a complete consensus here. We do not have a consensus — I admit, Commissioner, we did not lose many words about this earlier — on the issue of limit values. No one wants pesticide residues, either in the conventional or biological sector. That's clear.

This is indeed important to me, even after these long tough negotiations, that we have also taken the sector a good deal with us, And, above all, with regard to the implementation of delegated and implementing acts, it is important that we work together, so to speak, on practical implementation, so that in the end of the day, even those who still have doubts today can say: it has been a good job that we have all done here together.

The new regulation, which contains positive elements, whether in the extension of the production spectrum or in clarifying certain concepts, points out, however, in a direction which somehow subverts characteristics of organic farming, in particular paving the way for a certain industrialisation of the method of production biological. Taking advantage of the positive impact of a label, resulting from a positive perception of organic products for growing layers of consumers, and the associated economic gains, we take a path that distorts the concept of organic farming, as we see it today.

This is already the fourth or fifth report we have on this issue. The first point I would like to draw attention to is that it is evident today, even at COSAC level, and this is reflected in the report, it is clear today that there is much better relationship between national parliaments and the European Parliament, that both levels of institutions have understood that they cooperate in the a sense of giving democratic legitimacy to the European Union. What is the first news of this report? It is, in fact, to interpret the role of national parliaments in a constitutional sense, I would say, in a constitutional sense. Until now, we knew that national parliaments have a role at European level but we did not understand why, which was the reason, and it is quite clear here that national parliaments have a different vocation from that of governments: governments are represented in the Council of Ministers and in the European Council, but national parliaments bring an advantage, which is to reflect internal diversity. That is, internally there are different currents, while in the Council each government refers to a monolithic will of a state, the truth is that when national parliaments are called to be represented they bring majorities, minorities, internal diversity. That is why two proposals are made in this report. One is that representation in interparliamentary meetings is always proportionate, that is to say that there are representatives of the majority in Parliament but also of the minority, and another is that in the views that parliaments give, and particularly when they want, for example, concerning relative Commission initiatives, to activate the card yellow, may be the majority will of Parliament, but there may be a dissident vote, may be a vanquished vote of minorities. That is to say, to bring precisely the political arena that exists internally to the European level. So that is the specific role of national parliaments. Then there is another important step forward on the issue of the early warning system and the yellow card because all the national parliaments have told us that they had reservations about the eight-week deadline. We cannot change the Treaty, but we can accommodate these eight weeks and we therefore urge the European Commission to recognise that the period of eight weeks should not be counted during the holiday period and, furthermore, that it should give a technical period for all parliaments to receive at the same time translated versions of legislative initiatives. That's the only way we can activate the yellow card and give him, at last, the status he has. Finally, I would like to say, on this point, that there are several amendments here, particularly from the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group, which must be rejected because they say: 'well, the national parliaments do not use the eight weeks because they do not want'. This report must give a positive signal to the national parliaments and if they say that eight weeks are not enough, we can extend that deadline, even if it is a little, we must do so, and therefore reject those amendments by the Socialist Group and the Liberal Group, which are amendments against the parliaments national. Finally, I would like to say that we are also making a proposal here not to accept the green card, but to accept suggestions from the national parliaments to the European Commission regarding legislative initiatives, that we are here advocating a major strengthening of the IPEX, in the sense that all parliaments have updated and detailed information on European matters and, finally, I think that this is one of the most constructive proposals, it is the idea that we have a European week, that is, a simultaneous week in the 27 national parliaments which is a week to celebrate European themes. The presidents, the Commissioners, the Vice-Presidents of the Commission, the Members of the European Parliament of different nationalities in the 27 capitals, in the same week, at the same time, throughout Europe, have a European week, in which there can actually be, let us say, this reflection on these issues. It would, in essence, be a way of convening in parliaments in that direction which President Macron has advocated and which is a good sense for debating the future of Europe.

I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Rangel, and this House for the opportunity to discuss the implementation of the treaty provisions concerning national parliaments and for the important amount of fact finding and analysis that fed the preparation of the report. National parliaments play an essential role in bringing the Union closer to the people by both scrutinising the activity of their own government at European level and engaging with the European institutions. On the specific example of the European Semester, the Commission shares your views that national parliaments should be more closely involved in the preparation and approval of the national reform programmes and of the stability and convergence programmes. Currently only a few parliaments have the possibility to vote on these programmes, but this is a matter of national institutional organisation. As for the dialogue with the Commission, I would like to stress that national parliaments have not yet taken full advantage of the rights to request direct exchanges with the Commission on semester-related matters. Commissioners are available for discussion with national parliaments, as with the European Parliament. I also agree with the report’s assessment that national parliaments of an important role to play to curb gold-plating of EU legislation by Member States. The European Union is often blamed for imposing rules and burdens which do not derive from EU legislation but from national legislation and, when transposing directives, national parliaments should take responsibility and explain to the people when elements are added which go beyond the requirements of EU Union law. We recognise that sometimes gold-plating can be positive, for example, to improve coherence with or the performance of national law. But it is important for people to know who did what and why. The Commission believes the subsidiarity and proportionality must be important and must be at the heart of the European democratic process. In line with our better regulation agenda, the Commission invests great effort in ensuring that our proposals respect the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality. While the Treaties provide that national parliaments ensure compliance only with the principle of subsidiarity, the Commission also checks to complaints of its initiatives with the principle of proportionality in a thorough manner. So, when replying to opinions or reasoned opinions of national parliaments, we address both subsidiarity and proportionality issues as well as all other issues, political as well as technical, that are raised by the parliaments in their opinions. The fact that the yellow-card mechanism has only been triggered three times so far may be an indicator that our efforts to check the compliance of envisaged legislative proposals with both principles well before their adoption actually are working. The Commission is open to discussing these issues with national parliaments on how to improve our working arrangements on the subsidiarity-control mechanism. The task force on subsidiarity, proportionality and doing less more efficiently is currently reflecting on how to improve the practical functioning of this mechanism. I would like to stress that the Commission is always happy to discuss ideas from new EU initiatives from national parliaments as part of the political dialogue. In 2015 and 2016, the Commission give detailed replies to so-called green cards that it had received. These were on food waste and on corporate social responsibility. Given the dynamism of the political dialogue, I do not see any need for creating a formal process that could be difficult to reconcile with the current Treaties’ provisions. Finally, I would like to underline that the Commission is always happy to contribute to inter-parliamentary events and will be open to contributing to a European week such as is envisaged in this report. Once again I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work and to thank the House very much for its attention and keen interest in this very important issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 331, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "György SCHÖPFLIN", "mepid": "28135", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I would like to begin by offering my congratulations to Mr Rangel for a report of signal importance. There is no question as to whether or not national parliaments play a role in European politics, they do. Any holistic assessment would immediately come to this conclusion, but the strategic question is how this role is to be understood and regulated. Clearly, national parliaments cannot usurp the role and functions of this Parliament, but we cannot exclude the national parliaments from the European political system either. It’s the proper allocation of roles that can resolve questions of overlap or conflict. Here it seems to me the report is very clear. National parliaments are much better suited to holding their governments to account, implying that there should be a clear line of accountability between national parliaments and Council. There are best practices at the national level that are worth looking at. Then there is the at times sensitive relationship between national parliaments and this Parliament. These sensitivity is understandable where power relationships are involved and the lines of competences are fuzzy. The report goes a long way to identifying these fuzzy areas and makes valuable suggestions as to how to achieve clarity.

Too often in the Member States and their assemblies we refer to the democratic deficit of the Union; but we must ask ourselves whether all possible instruments are really used at national level which are already available. As some colleagues have pointed out, would it not be more judicious to stimulate better cooperation and coordination between national parliaments and their governments? Governments should better explain their positions in the Council so that their parliaments can react, and the report also goes along those lines. The Council itself, perhaps, should also operate more transparently, making it easier to control parliaments. In particular, of course, parliaments control over national governments is the milestone of the role that national parliaments must play and it is necessary, and for example, to reach a higher degree of control of the parliaments themselves but also, by the European Parliament, of the Union's fiscal and economic policies. It is good the idea contained in the report of calls for it to be created this European parliamentary week, which could bring together national MEPs, MEPs and Commissioners, as well as the organisation to Regular deadlines for debates between the ministers concerned and the specialised committees of the national parliaments before and after the Council meeting.

However, on the reform of the early warning system, I disagree. Many tend to believe that extending the period of eight weeks for the national parliaments will get them more involved. I believe the contrary actually, because first, if we want really to extend it then we have to change the Treaty, and we cannot do that. Secondly, I don’t believe that the national parliament will jump in the air in excitement just because they have a couple more days. Thirdly, if you want technically to adopt it, it has to be said that we do sometimes do it. And, finally and most importantly, we are often criticised for being too bureaucratic, that the legislation takes too long and extending it even more is not a good idea. I know that national parliaments sometimes blame everything on the EU, and that problem would not be solved by inventing new tools and instruments.

The Treaty of Lisbon has become known as the Treaty of Parliaments because it has not only considerably increased the power of the European Parliament but also recognised prerogatives of national parliaments and their constitutional role within the European framework. These include the control of a subsidiarity and proportionality and ensuring the democratic legitimacy of European decision-making, in particular when double legitimacy is at stake There are 41 national chambers in the European Union and they cooperate with us, the European Parliament, through numerous platforms. But the core function of national parliaments is in the area of European decision-making, and this remains democratic scrutiny and monitoring of their national government’s activity in the Council and in the European Council, and this is the shortest way to influence European decision-making. National parliaments are even more relevant for the process of European legislation through their role in the transposition, implementation and enforcement of European legislation at national level. They are irreplaceable in the better law-making agenda. They can effectively prevent the gold-plating of European legislation and improve the institutional capacity to implement European legislation at national level. But today, let me add one more issue and invite national parliaments to get involved in launching national debates on Europe’s future as they can indeed be an excellent vehicle for engaging citizens in shaping the future of Europe.

Firstly, I believe that we must prevent the interpretation of subsidiarity and proportionality — which are powers of national parliaments — from becoming expansive, in a way that somehow limits the powers of the European institutions, and in particular the Commission. My personal experience is that, increasingly, European Union policy is demanding to address issues that only European competition can address — let us put energy union, combat tax havens or tax harmonisation, put the Digital Agenda... — there are many issues that demand the initiative European legislation. And I do not want an expansive interpretation of subsidiarity or proportionality to limit the powers of the European institutions. Secondly, I think that much of what is currently failing in the framework of relations between the European Union and national parliaments is because national parliaments do not bring the European debate just to their own seats. I think there is a lot of opportunities for national parliaments to speak more about Europe; for them to talk more with us; for MEPs to participate in parliamentary debates; so that, indeed, there can be a debate in the national Parliament before each European Council, etc. My impression is, ladies and gentlemen, that a lot of what is wrong in the debate on the relationship between national parliaments and European institutions is taking place in national parliaments, and it would not be bad for national parliaments to read this report carefully.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 340, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Maite PAGAZAURTUNDÚA", "mepid": "125038", "text": " Mr President, first of all we congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Rangel.

The national parliaments are guardians of the subsidiarity principle and control the European activity of these governments; but, as Mr Jáuregui has pointed out, European legislative initiative is increasingly key to the great global challenges in this changing and turmoil world.

At the same time, however, it must be clear that decisions in a Parliament must fall where the competence lies. We cannot have shared competence in making decisions. In terms of European competences, it is the European Parliament, and in terms of national competences, it is the national parliament. Accordingly, we must then run the information strands, as we have at various events, such as Article 13 events in the Economic and Monetary Union, the Foreign Affairs Assembly of National Parliaments and the European Parliament, or COSAC, for example.

The positive thing about the report is that it will encourage national parliaments to fully exercise their European functions in order to directly influence European policies and control their content. Better synergies and enhanced exchange of information between Members of the European Parliament and members of national parliaments could help improve control of the European debate at national level and thus promote a truly European parliamentary and political culture. I also support the creation of an annual European week, which can be held simultaneously in the 27 national parliaments and which should be attended by the Commissioners and the European Parliament, where European issues can be discussed.

Next week, for example, the Agriculture and Rural Development Committee of this House is organising a joint meeting with the agricultural committees of the national parliaments, which will provide a very useful opportunity for members of national parliaments to contribute to the preparation of the common agricultural policy and the Commission’s legislative proposal. So I think that this is a good example, if we can do more of this in relation to the relevant national committees and the European Parliament and the European Commission, I think it would be very helpful. Can I conclude by again thanking Paulo Rangel for his report, for his work? And I hope that this report will contribute to the strengthening of the role of national parliaments in a manner in which will make sure that European policy-making is closer to the people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 349, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Paulo RANGEL", "mepid": "96903", "text": " rapporteur. — Madam President, it is an honor to be shared first with our league from the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, Mr Castaldo, and for the Vice-President responsible for national parliaments. So I think this is a lucky occasion. Thank you very much. Madam President, I would just like to emphasise two aspects that have been raised here in the debate before, of course, thanking everyone for their contribution and, in particular, also for Commissioner Hogan's words, but I would like to emphasise the following: the first point, which I think is very important, is to draw attention to that it is very important that the Commission, in its examination of subsidiarity, be a little more open. Indeed, the link between subsidiarity and proportionality is extremely difficult to make, and so there should be a self-restraint when you rush to deny any yellow card saying that it is about proportionality rather than subsidiarity. This was the aspect that should be taken into account. This does not disregard what Mr Jáuregui Atondo says because subsidiarity in many cases involves handing over competence to the European Commission, to the European Union and not to the national states and not to national parliaments. But in many situations proportionality is invoked as a pretext for not making a genuine assessment of subsidiarity. That was an aspect I would like to mark here. And the second point was to insist on the idea that giving national parliaments some more time and some time off is fair and due, and it is fair and due for this reason: not all national parliaments have the resources they have, for example, the German parliament or the Swedish parliament, and therefore, of course, the way in which in certain circumstances whether to assess certain matters also depends from country to country and structure to structure and therefore creating a little more time allows all parliaments to be placed on an equal footing and allows for dialogue greater among the various parliaments. There is one point I would like to emphasise, which I see myself and almost all Members have emphasised them, which is: of course the great role of the national parliaments is in controlling their governments. That's the point. If they are able to do so proficiently I am sure that the European Union will work better.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 350, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Mairead McGUINNESS", "mepid": "28115", "text": "  The debate is closed.

First of all, let me thank all the shadow rapporteurs. We have done very good work together. This is my second time as rapporteur of the Annual Report on Competition Policy. The first time was with Commissioner Almunia in 2013. This may be the last competition report of this term. Next year we will have European elections again. As you know, this is a non—binding report, but it sends a strong political message to the Commission. In the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs this report was approved with 49 votes in favour and only five against. I hope we will have the same huge majority in plenary tomorrow. I have to say that some of the competition problems are the same as five years ago, among them the Google antitrust case. In the Google case, five years seems an eternity to me. I say to the Commissioner that still hope that we can close some of the cases before the end of the Commission’s mandate. In this report we strongly support the independence of the Commission and the national competition authorities. Their mission is to shape and enforce effectively EU competition rules for the benefit of all EU citizens. Sufficient financial and human resources are key to achieving this goal. An independent competition policy needs independent competition authorities. Political appointments tend to protect oligopolies and cost millions to European citizens. In this report we call on the Commission to reallocate adequate financial and human resources to DG Competition, as we did last year. We also call for the modernisation of the Directorate’s electronic and informatic tools in order to cope with the increasing workload and technological progress.  Regarding the issue of data, we have all been shocked by the Facebook and Cambridge Analytica scandal. Well, I am proud. We have been denouncing the utilisation and misuse of data for some years now. Paragraph 44 of this report, written well before the Facebook scandal, states that “big tech companies’ use of personal data is unprecedented. Consumers are often not aware or informed of the extent to which their data is being used, for example in profiling or targeted advertising”. The Commission was well aware of this. To avoid further such scandals in the EU, the new GDPR rules that are coming into force are good news in this respect.  Regarding the Google antitrust shopping case, in paragraph 42 we put the unbundling of Google back on the table as one of the options to restore equal treatment and non—discrimination in search results. We also invite Google’s CEO to a joint IMCO/ECON hearing in Parliament. We can sum up the Google case in a short tweet: inaction brings Google unbundling closer every day.  Commissioner Vestager, I have some questions for you. Would you have updates to give us today on the shopping antitrust case? In addition, what about the Android and AdSense cases. Finally, you were in the US last week. I hope you had interesting meetings. If you could talk to us about them, it would be very well received.  In paragraph 56, we welcome the Commission’s simplification of the rules for public investment in ports and airports. All major infrastructure should be based on a positive cost benefit analysis and long—term economic viability in order to avoid the future financing of ghost airports in Europe. We also raised the issue of airlines’ competition and the concerns with regard to Gulf carriers. We need financial transparency in order to confirm or dismiss alleged public subsidies which break the level playing field among European and third country airlines. Finally, we also welcome the fact that, from now on, direct flights between Tokyo and Barcelona will be possible. We welcome the fact that the Spanish Government is ready to open up the bilateral agreement between Spain and Russia – which prevents there from being a Barcelona-Tokyo route – as announced by the Spanish Minister of Transport last February. Competition is the best remedy against transport centralism. I will stop here. Once again, I thank all the rapporteurs for their contributions. I look forward to your comments and our exchange.

I think that we may disagree in concrete cases, but we do agree that competition makes our economy work better for everyone – that the market serves the customer. That enables our Union to do what citizens expect: that they make sure that they get treated fairly.  This of course includes the work that we do on state aid, because if success is about getting the biggest subsidy from government and not about serving customers in a better way, then obviously consumers lose out. So we have decided that Amazon had to pay back some EUR 250 million in unpaid taxes to Luxembourg. We have launched investigations into the tax treatment of Inter IKEA in the Netherlands, and whether the UK rule on tax avoidance involving controlled foreign companies treats some businesses differently from others.  But state aid rules are not just about tax. They are also to make sure that government support for important priorities like research and fighting climate change has the right effect, to make sure that public money does not just replace investment which companies would have made anyway; that aid does not deny innovative companies the chance to compete. But of course those rules should not make it difficult for support where our economy needs support.  In a couple of weeks, the Commission will present a proposal for a new Multiannual Financial Framework, and as part of that we are looking at how we can make state aid rules simpler so that it is easier for European funding from the European budget to link up with national funding. So our common European actions match our ambitions on research, on climate change, on support for small- and medium-sized businesses and on social infrastructure, and I am very keen to discuss the proposal with you once it is complete.  We have also been making sure that mergers do not harm European consumers. In fact, 2017 turned out to be the second busiest year of European merger control. And it is not just about the number of cases: mergers are getting bigger. They are reshaping the entire global economy, so consumers need protection from mergers now more than ever. Last month, we approved the merger between Bayer and Monsanto, and we only did that after the companies agreed to sell off businesses worth more than EUR six billion. That will mean that farmers will still have a wide choice, as they did before, when it comes to suppliers of seeds and pesticides, and it will mean that companies are still driven to innovate, to produce better, safer pesticides.  I know that Members of this House and people in the European public as well have concerns about this industry – concerns that go well beyond competition, but the right way to deal with it is not to extend the competition rules; it is to have strong, effective regulation that makes sure that pesticides are safe.  We also need to defend competition in digital markets so consumers get a fair deal online, and this is why we are watching very closely and analysing in—depth, in the most granular way, to make sure that Google treats rival comparison shopping services fairly. A case is not done with a decision: that is the start of the enforcement of that decision, looking into the choices that Google have made. And we are advancing – to answer your question, Ramon – on our two cases involving Google, both the Android case and the AdSense case.

For example, it is crucial that all companies make an adequate and fair tax contribution to the single coffers, and is there anyone cheating on the tax ticket through cunning corporate constructions or illegal government subsidies, well then it creates unfair competition for all the others. Competition policy is also labour market policy, because you bypass posting rules or doing social dumping, then you no longer compete on a level playing field to the detriment of businesses, workers and consumers. That is why it is also vital for competition that national competition authorities help ensure uniform enforcement of EU rules, and that is why we also say both a great thank you for - and we are very happy about - the new ECN+ network that can help to increase the independence of national competition authorities.

This competition policy is ensuring a fair standard of living for the agricultural community, as the farming sector is under pressure from constant economic and climate-related hazards.  The colleagues on the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development therefore gave a strong signal. A market-oriented common agricultural policy needs to provide support for farmers and grant additional time—limited exemptions from certain competition rules. While competition policy defends consumers’ interests, it has to take account of the interests and difficulties of agricultural producers and rural people too.

One hopes that this is not happening for the wrong reasons. In principle, competition policy is meant to ensure that free market rules apply to the benefit of consumers all over Europe. In practice, given that historically the role of national governments in Europe has been a crucial element of economic development, the focus has frequently been – and still is, as we have just heard – more on questions relating to state aid than on matters arising from corporate competitive strategies. In this, it has been difficult to avoid one—size—fits—all approaches that failed to discriminate – and still fail to discriminate sufficiently – between north and south, island and metropole, peripheral and central. The privatisation of major infrastructural functions, such as in transport and utilities and now public health, has simply been seen as economically desirable if cast in competitive format. But the social impact, as well as some economic ones, have not been given sufficient attention. Now, the emphasis is also shifting towards state aid considerations with regard to taxation policies. Such policies are still subject to the sovereignty of Member States, but competition policy is being deployed to oversee and correct for them. One gets the impression, in fact, that the rules and methods by which this is being done are created on the hoof – basically, on a case-by-case basis. Tax flexibility within Member States under conditions, of course. A full transparency should be considered as an integral part of the competitive situation and is vital for the prosperity of smaller Member States and the single market. It will be a pity if competition policy comes to be driven according to the urgings of the tax populace while pushing for harmonisation of tax policies, and we have no problems with choosing competition policy to achieve this. However, we should watch out. The approach, apparently progressive, could serve to perhaps screen another reality at a time when European economies are again growing well: working and middle-class people as well as pensioners are not being compensated for the sacrifices they had to make during years of austerity. They will not be consoled by being told that, in the interests of competition, taxation within the Union should be harmonised.

Commissioner, it is always nice to see your passion and your passion for European competition policy. You're just right. Look, unity in diversity is the slogan of the European Union, but some of them place particular emphasis on unity. We all have to do the same thing. Member States must go beyond their individuality. The diversity is perceived as a weakness. We must ensure that there is no competition and certainly not between countries. The opposite is true. On the contrary, our European civilisation differs from others, precisely because we have seen this rivalry and competition throughout our history. That makes us who we are. This competition between kingdoms, between principalities, between city-states has ensured that we are still living the European miracle to this day and that the European miracle has been made possible. We see that in the results. We have cities that flourish, we have trade networks, we have schools, we have universities. We see the flourishing of philosophy and science, our literature, our culture. All this has been made possible by this competition, including our unprecedented economic progress. Not despite our political fragmentation, but thanks to the fact that we are different and that we are competing with each other. Our diversity is a strength.

Perhaps this year we should talk about the role of Parliament. There is a decision or a decision by you that, of course, disturbs me as a Green: this is the Monsanto merger. I took a close look at the decision. You have made the right decision on the basis of the law, the competition law of the European Union. But if ecological criteria do not play a role in preventing this merger, then the law is the problem, not its implementation. Then we in the European Parliament are called upon to consider whether we need legislation that protects not only markets, but also the environment and democracy. This brings me to the topic that is often addressed here: digital platforms. It is true that we are applying competition law to protect our consumers and our businesses, but it also has a democratic aspect.

The SSM prepares the conditions for the takeover of our national banks by national banking giants. To finance themselves, individuals and small and medium-sized enterprises in our European states do not need banking giants on Wall Street, or above-ground capital markets, they simply need trust relationships and total and local bank financing.

It is a rules-based single market, and we have got to make sure that our competition policy delivers rules for consumers and for businesses big and small, to make sure it is fair competition, and we need in the Annual Report – as has been said by the rapporteur – to make that very, very, clear. We also need to support national competition authorities – I think you said before, Commissioner, that 85% of all cases are taken at the national level. They need support, they need resources, and they need a legal basis to take cases. I very much support the ECN+ Directive, which is about giving additional support to national authorities.  Three particular points in relation to my own country: in Ireland, we have to prove on a criminal charge, which is a very high charge, whether or not an enforcement can be taken. We need to move to a non-criminal basis. Secondly, in Ireland we do not apply a leniency programme, which would encourage national competition authorities to cut deals with people to give evidence so that those cases can be taken in court to reduce fines for those businesses that come forward with evidence. The third point is a Brexit-related issue: as you can understand, in my country we share information with the UK on a daily basis, with their competition authority to our competition authority.

Its importance is highlighted by the essential points raised within – points that this Parliament defends. I welcome the attention given to the national competition authorities, taking into account the role these administrations play in fighting trusts. Keeping in mind that competition policy is enforced, not only by the Commission but also largely by the national competition authorities, it is a good thing that the report encourages the European Competition Network Plus (ECN+) proposal so we can progress towards the strongest capacity, more resources, autonomy and transparency. A second point emphasised in this report is the fight for fair taxation. Indeed, tax avoidance hurts fair competition in the single market. It penalises new entrants and small and medium-sized enterprises compared to multinational corporations, which are the only ones with the resources to implement aggressive tax planning schemes.  I am glad to see that the report encourages as well the Common Consolidated Corporate Tax Base negotiations, pointing out that this would solve Europe’s problem of unfair tax competition. It also specifically mentions the Amazon case – the Commission having recognised that the company benefited from illegal tax advantages.  However, Amazon is not the only company named in the report – there are also several mentions of Google, which has abused its market dominant position by giving an advantage to another of its products, its comparison shopping service, preventing potential competitors from emerging in the search engine sector. It is important to encourage the Commission’s actions towards fairer competition. This is the case with the current investigations into Luxembourg’s ‘sweetheart’ deal with McDonald’s. Furthermore, the report also points out some shortcomings of the Commission and encourages it to go further. That is the case for the aviation sector.

It is a theme that often affects and punishes those small realities in the states and regions of Europe that are in serious difficulties. I am referring to the case of more than three hundred small businesses and craftsmen in Abruzzo, a region of my country that was struck in 2009 by a terrible earthquake and which today, according to a decision on state aid The European Commission, after almost ten years, they are invited to return aid for concessions which the Italian State had granted to these companies affected by the earthquake. Without this money such businesses would have closed, jobs would have been lost and today no longer exist. If these entrepreneurs are called upon to return the money in question, we will have a loss of jobs, we will have a drama that adds to the further drama.

Unfortunately, these proposals were stuck in the Council and debates inside there.

Secondly, I also agree that fair tax competition is essential for the integrity of the internal market. It is, inter alia, for this reason, that I believe that the Commission should have the right to read tax decisions, tax information of individual companies within the discretion of individual tax authorities in order to check their compliance with competition rules. At the same time, I want to say that in order to remain competitive, it is necessary to provide simple and transparent tax rules — one that will not seek to harmonise tax rates, but will seek to unify the tax base.

Regarding the things that we are discussing right now, when it comes to data I think this is the best example of the fact that we need competition law enforcement to the spirit and the letter of our regulation, but we also need new regulation. The two things will have to go hand in hand.  I think this House needs praise for the fact that the new privacy rules coming into effect next month have been done in such a timely manner. This House did not wait for a scandal like the Facebook scandal to unfold. On the contrary, beforehand, this House, knowing how powerless Europeans feel when it comes to privacy, enabled new, simpler, enforceable rules. I think that is very important. We will of course do our part when it comes to misuse of a dominant position if we find cartels or if we find that contracts are being used in a way actually to disable innovation, preventing small and medium—sized businesses from doing their part when it comes to data. That of course leads directly to the question of taxation. So many small and medium—sized businesses pay their taxes, create jobs and have to look at multinational businesses, which can easily afford to contribute to the society where they do their business and which accept or ask for ways to organise their taxation in order to pay very, very little in taxes. This is not fair competition. But, of course, state aid enforcement does not solve this. We need legislation as well. It is also very important to see that the Council has passed legislation in the last two years in order to close loopholes, in order to increase transparency and in order to hold the intermediaries responsible. But the new proposals on the table are also important, for instance, the proposal that will update a very important concept in corporate taxation to a digital world. On average, digital companies pay 10% in tax. Other companies pay 23-24% in tax on average. It is important to update our taxation to make sure that the business that makes a revenue in a society also contributes to that society. We will of course continue to do what we do, but we also need to work with colleagues who work with legislation in general. When it comes to agriculture, I think there is a deep and very common understanding of the fact that the bargaining powers in the value chain are very different, from being a small individual farmer to being large retail chains. This is why we have done our best to enable farmers to come together, to have higher prices and lower costs, and are also working very closely with colleagues in the Commission to make sure that, when there is legislation on unfair trading practices, these are targeted and actually help the people that we want to help. Regarding the question on earthquake and natural disasters, I think anyone can feel the pain of seeing their business, home, village or city destroyed by an earthquake. This is also reflected in our Treaty. Our Treaty allows for help and compensation for damage. That is being done. It was done in the 2009 scheme and it is being done right now with what the Italian Government has put in place due to their earthquakes in 2016 and 2017. But you cannot compensate people who have not had damage. If your business was a letterbox business and you have had no damage, you can have no compensation. If your damage is of a certain size, then your compensation should reflect that and that is what has been raised. The good thing – and I think everyone finds this to be important and a good thing – is that the people who had damage were compensated for this damage in the right way.  On the Greek cases that were raised, unfortunately I do not know the details. It was decided in the previous Commission and this is why. I will be more than happy to report back to you in writing.  Last but not least, I am very happy with the support of the national competition authorities. The approach of this House is to empower national competition authorities to protect citizens in each and every Member State, to make sure that, when they enforce European competition law, they have the independence, the human resources, the resources and ability to have digital evidence, and of course to impose fines that act as a deterrent. I find that this is a very important message from this House tonight. I hope that we can work together to pass this directive within a very short timeframe because it is a signal to citizens that you should not only look to Brussels, but you can also look to your national competition authority and know that they are empowered to protect you in order to have a fair deal in the marketplace. On that basis, thank you very much for the report. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for the effort that has been put into it. I hope that there will be a successful vote tomorrow.

I also fully share the opinion of my colleague from the EPP from the Irish, Mr Hayes, about the importance of national competition authorities, and in this sense the countries in the north of Europe can give some lessons to the southern European countries in this respect. This is why we give a strong mandate to the Commission in this report to take a look at what is going on in some capitals concerning this very important point.  Let me also answer some concerns about the tax competition: of course I believe in tax competition and we can talk about our own edition of the tax base, but I am against tax harmonisation concerning the rate: I think that is a very liberal approach. If we look at the United States, very briefly, they have a centralised monetary policy but a highly decentralised fiscal policy. There is a lot of empirical evidence and a lot of economic literature showing that it is very important to compensate the differentiated effects of the centralised monetary policy. This is why it is needed to have a highly decentralised fiscal policy to compensate territorial and sectoral differentiated effects of the single monetary policy in the US. I think that Europe can learn big lessons from this long experience they have in the US. Finally, Madam Commissioner, it has been a pleasure to work with you and your team. Your work has been quite impressive, we have to recognise, in the last years. I want you to be successful and end your mandate as well as you have started it.

On 4 July 2017, a long time ago, Parliament adopted its decision on the proposal for a Directive on public country-by-country reporting. The aim is to increase transparency and public control of corporate income tax and to promote corporate responsibility by imposing disclosure obligations on certain companies. The content of the new Directive is better reporting requirements for companies. The initiative aims at new accounting standards for groups, which is why the Commission has submitted to amend the Accounting Directive on the basis of Article 50 and has chosen the legal basis accordingly. The European Parliament confirmed this election on the basis of the opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of 12 January 2017. Two institutions, the Commission and Parliament, therefore agree that it is a matter of transparency obligations, accounting, financial reporting — that is, the balance sheet of companies — and not a new tax initiative. We have our mandate to negotiate with them. We have been in our mandate since last July to finalise the Group's public tax return. You in the Council have still not presented a plan or approach to public country-by-country reporting. Why? Because some finance ministers doubt the legal basis and claim that this is a new tax initiative. That is why Article 115 should form the legal basis. It is clear to the European Parliament's position that the proposal is not aimed at harmonising taxes or improving cooperation between tax authorities, nor is it aimed at creating new tax obligations. Only certain companies, the largest on the planet, are required to create a Publish your income tax information report. Call it the Group public tax return. This report is therefore the heart of good corporate governance for groups in Europe. And that is what it is about: accountability of the multi-corporations to all taxpayers in Europe. Public control, because so far, citizens of Europe have not been able to trust the large corporations or all governments. In view of the Union's international obligations, what is the Council's justification for the blockade? We, as the European Union, are at the forefront of public country-by-country reporting. I refer to the report on the disclosure of non-financial information, to the directive which has already put in place a lot here. Do you want to follow the system of a Trump? How do you justify the two-year delays? How do you justify the Council's position on the legal basis? Is it clear to ministers that the proposal does not concern the level of national taxes to be paid? Is the Group tax return in the Council a priority? How does the Council intend to make progress on this important proposal so that it will be possible to move forward during this parliamentary term? Clearly, only large corporations are obliged to transparency. Small and medium-sized enterprises are excluded. So only the very big ones, those with a turnover of more than 750 million euros, are affected. This debate is thus a sham debate by some finance ministers and the tactics of individual ministers to simply block EU laws that are unpleasant to them, wait for weed to grow over it and no one talks about it. Ask the individual ministers who are blocking. Ask the Austrian colleague: why are you blocking the law, Minister? Is it because the law affects the big corporations so much because the big corporations do not want this? With this, you protect no start-ups, no coffee house on the corner, not even the big companies themselves. They only protect the huge companies, the corporations, which currently pay little or no taxes. It is therefore the right of all taxpayers, all taxpayers in Europe, to know how much tax companies such as Google, Facebook, Starbucks and Co. pay in our countries, and that is why I call on you to work in the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 376, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, let me thank first of all Ms Regner, the co-rapporteur, as well as the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs, Mr Svoboda, for this question. This is an important file and this proposal presented by the Commission in 2016 is a key element in fighting base erosion and profit-shifting. The Council has worked a lot on the text of the proposal. More than 15 meetings of the relevant working party took place under four successive Presidencies. In February this year, Mr Svoboda and Mr Gualtieri wrote to our Ambassador inquiring about the state of play and insisting on a possible speeding—up of our deliberations. We replied to this letter, recalling that there are unresolved political issues which still prevent agreement in the Council.  One of these issues is the legal base of the proposal. Indeed this aspect calls into question the very applicability of the ordinary legislative procedure in this file.  The Bulgarian Presidency has taken over the results of the technical work, which was well advanced under the successive Presidencies that preceded us. So we are currently pursuing consultations with delegations with a view to further advancing the file. But you will understand that I cannot make any specific commitments today.

With the reform, the tax data of large multinational corporations will become public so that citizens and national authorities can look at them. The data enables the control that companies take care of their tax responsibilities in the Member States where they have made profits. A key purpose of country-by-country reporting is to bring transparency to corporate taxation. Parliament decided on the matter at the July 2017 plenary session. The final text decided to impose a reporting obligation on undertakings whose turnover exceeds EUR 750 million. I personally supported setting the turnover limit significantly lower than this, at EUR 40 million, but the majority vote for a higher turnover limit won the vote in the plenary session. Although the text adopted was not as ambitious as I had hoped for myself, it is an important step towards transparency in corporate taxation and a significant means of tackling the tax base from tax evasion.

Scientific research has allowed millions of citizens to be released from the risk of infectious disease contagion among the most insidious, because they threaten survival and very often affect levels of quality of life. Large-scale use of immunization practices contributed to the eradication of many infectious diseases, which therefore were robbed for a long time by the epidemiological chronicle. Now the landscape has changed: the number of subjects who fall ill, for example, with measles and painfully lengthens the list of victims, as happened in Italy, Romania and also, to a lesser extent, in other states. European citizens, among others, are those who show greater perplexity over the safety and effectiveness of vaccines. Epidemiological data for the period from 2008 to 2015 represent the figure of Europeans' mistrust of vaccination practices and, therefore, of their effectiveness and safety: 215 000 are cases of reported diseases that could be safely prevented and these numbers net of influenza epidemics. I would like to add some other considerations: if Europe really is the space in which to counteract inequalities and give back opportunities, then the goal of eradicating the disease coincides with the narrative of a Europe that contrasts marginalities, poverty and deprivation, freeing the future above all in favour of the most precious capital: our children and girls. It also means for Europe to take responsibility for refocusing and retraining public expenditure in health, particularly in this area, with the understanding that the benefits are certainly higher than costs, both health and social, because you invest in health, because you invests in quality of life. We call on the European institutions to take a bigger role in governance of health policies to reverse the current trend, which sees the underestimation of the benefits of practice growing vaccination, challenged by misinformation campaigns that feed doubts about efficacy and safety and on which, unfortunately, speculates the most becerous populism. Europe therefore has responsibility for transparent information, correct, closely linked to pharmacovigilance activities, within strict compliance with the ethical and moral profile of each actor of the system. It is up to Europe to call Member States to comply with their commitments, including the promotion of the search for new life-saving vaccines and promoting vaccination practices in certain numbers greater than recorded today. It is up to Europe to identify any useful intervention that reduces the costs of acquiring vaccines, thus making them easily accessible, and above all, in the countries which have the most investment difficulties and therefore spending. It is quite clear, Commissioner, the need to realign vaccination calendars in Europe, which is called today to new challenges related to immigration and increasing mobility for reasons of study, work and also of leisure; promoting a democratic path that reconnects science with citizens, system operators, associations to value advantages, clarify doubts, stigmatise any distortions and contamination of the system, freeing it from any suspicion of conflict of interest. That seems to me to be the goal of our discussion and our confrontation. Democratic information, communication training: education is the most effective tool to defeat mistrusts and fears. Advising and recommending is certainly better than obliging: but to make compulsory the Vaccination practice may be a necessary step to achieve the goal of immunization of flock that really securely people.

In order to increase vaccination coverage, which is the only means to counteract the public health threats caused by vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccine hesitancy is however only one of the problems to tackle. It is equally important to prevent vaccine shortages and to find means to develop new vaccines. The Council has taken several initiatives relating to vaccination. In the Council conclusions of 2014, Ministers agreed on a comprehensive list of actions intended to increase the vaccination coverage in the European Union and invited Member States and the Commission to implement those actions. Among these actions, one of them aims at strengthening the role of healthcare professionals in recommending vaccination, which directly links to the issues raised by the honourable Members. The Council will further undertake a detailed analysis of the measures in this field, including measures aimed at tackling vaccine hesitancy, when examining the forthcoming Commission proposal for a Council Recommendation on Strengthening Cooperation against Vaccine—Preventable Diseases. The Bulgarian Presidency is in contact with the Commission with regard to the proposal. As soon as the proposal is published, we will initiate the discussions in the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 1, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 1, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 395, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you very much indeed for this oral question. Vaccination is one of the most powerful public health measures we have at our disposal. Widespread vaccination has eradicated smallpox and made Europe polio—free. It prevents countless deaths and stops millions of people from contracting illnesses each year. There are not so many other interventions that can claim to be so effective. That being said, sorry, but now over 14 000 people contracted measles in the European Union in 2017 – more than three times than in 2016. And 57 deaths due to measles have been reported here since 2016. It is so painful to see this picture. A safe, effective and cheap measles vaccine exists, so every one of these deaths is unacceptable. They are avoidable deaths, preventable deaths. It is deeply unacceptable.  So why on earth are people avoiding vaccinations? Well, there is a shift away from the individual and collective benefits of vaccinations to increased distrust and fear of possible side effects. That is true. Misinformation by vaccination deniers and the rapid spread of fake information is clearly a factor. But we cannot just dismiss vaccine hesitancy as a question of ignorance. People have concerns about the vaccines and we need to address these. Vaccine hesitancy is a common problem across Member States. Solving this problem depends on strengthened coordination at European Union level. So I am very encouraged by the Parliament’s resolution. Thank you very much indeed; it is very timely. I also want to ensure that vaccination is an absolute priority for me as Commissioner and it is very important that I see cross—party engagement on this issue.  Now, you have asked me some important questions and I want to address each of them individually. First, how does the Commission plan to address this resistance to vaccination? Based on your draft resolution it seems that we share many of the same concerns, including the difference in vaccine rates across Member States and increasing vaccine hesitancy. These issues need a strategic and coordinated response. With that in mind, the Commission is planning to adopt an initiative on a vaccination very soon – maybe next week. The Parliament’s draft resolution is very much in line with our own proposal. We plan to focus first on tackling vaccine hesitancy and increasing vaccination uptake. Now is the time to act in ensuring vaccine supply and improving cooperation across the European Union. Healthcare workers and health professionals play a crucial role in promoting vaccination and addressing concerns related to hesitancy. So we are exploring how to create a coalition of health associations to increase vaccination coverage. We also need to find ways to deliver accurate and timely information to the public of these genuine concerns, exchanging best practices and combating myths.  Under the European Union Health Programme we are launching a project or joint action with Member States that will also address vaccine hesitancy. The joint action is led by France and will, first, establish mapping of best practices and analyse the reasons behind high and low vaccination coverage and, secondly, set up social media infrastructures to conduct real—time public vaccine confidence monitoring. Your second question, how does the Commission intend to ensure that a comprehensive European Union action plan raising the social problem of vaccine hesitancy is elaborated? As you know, vaccination programmes are the competence of Member States. But given the close border nature of disease outbreaks, some Member States have requested support suggesting the need for coordinated approaches. This makes absolute sense and this is also the reason our initiative is in the form of a Council recommendation. There is a clear added value in strengthening cooperation at EU level including among health authorities, the vaccine industry, research and innovations, healthcare providers and other stakeholders, keeping all on board. Make no mistake, each of these stakeholders needs to be enrolled if we are to properly address this issue. The Commission will encourage and support Member States’ outreach to the most disadvantaged groups including by promoting health mediators and grassroots community networks. We will also work with Member States to simplify and broaden opportunities for vaccination. This means identifying the barriers to access and supporting interventions to increase access for disadvantaged and socially—excluded groups. The Commission initiative would aim to achieve these goals. Indeed, we intend to focus on one of the proposal’s main pillars on tackling vaccine hesitancy. Your third question, what concrete actions is the Commission planning to facilitate a more harmonised schedule for vaccinations across the EU? Vaccination schedules vary considerably between Member States due to differences in the way vaccination programmes are organised. These differences take into account, of course, historical vaccine registrations and the specific burden of disease and the cost—effectiveness of single vaccinations. Together, these inconsistencies can give the sense that there is a lack of scientific consensus on vaccine schedules, which could in turn lead to vaccine hesitancy.  A European Union—wide common vaccination schedule would solve many of these problems. For example, it would mitigate the risk that children miss a vaccine by moving, together with their parents, from one Member States to another. Furthermore, this would decrease supply problems and increase the value of programme monitoring. To address this issue, the joint action on vaccination aims to map the evidence base of national vaccination calendars. This will provide an important basis for a common vaccination schedule in the future.  As a starting point, we need a system to collect and share data on vaccination. This requires the involvement of all Member States and we hope that we can build on the excellent work of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. The fourth question, how does the Commission plan to address the spread of unreliable and misleading scientific information on vaccinations and to further develop information campaigns aimed at providing more in—depth knowledge about vaccines and increasing vaccination coverage? The spread of accurate and timely information in an age of information overload is a huge challenge. When it comes to vaccination, we need to be extremely vigilant and responsive to rumours, myth and misinformation. The Commission will explore, with Member States, how to support their communication activities and awareness—raising on the benefits of vaccination by, first, presenting scientific evidence to counter the spread of fake news. Second, engaging with healthcare workers, education stakeholders and the media, as advocates and multipliers, to fight complacency and increase trust in immunisation.  I want to assist in increasing the bearings and confidence of citizens in their national vaccine programmes. We feel that campaigns are best developed at national level by experts who understand the national and cultural context.  We are working closely with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to propose ways to provide objective and transparent evidence on vaccines and pharmacovigilance processes. We also need to build on synergies with other Commission initiatives such as the upcoming initiative addressing the spread of fake news. Honourable Members, colleagues, at a time when our health systems are under increasing pressure and are asked to do more with less, we simply cannot afford to waste the potential of vaccinations to save lives. We need to harness our all our resources and energy in a coordinated effort to restore public confidence in vaccination. Our work with Member States is very much in line with Parliament’s resolution.  So we are moving in the right direction together. But this is only the beginning and I invite you to be fully involved in this effort. I look forward to working closely with Parliament and to doing everything in my power to increase vaccine coverage in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 2, "sars": 0, "measles": 3, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 2, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 6, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 396, "date": "2018-04-18.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": " on behalf of the PPE Group. — (DE) Madam President, Commissioner. Thank you for this committed statement. Yes, there are diseases that we barely remember, which we may have had as children, which, if we are a little older — like me — can be life-threatening. People have obviously forgotten this: measles can be life-threatening. There are countries where measles has been eradicated or almost eradicated through vaccination programs — Guatemala is such a country. Nevertheless, a student from Guatemala has become infected with measles. But she did not become infected in Guatemala, but in Germany, where she was on a student exchange, and then — not knowing that she was ill — she returned this disease to Guatemala. Suddenly there's measles again. This shows that there is too little vaccination in Germany. It is not only the case in Germany, it is the case throughout the EU. Vaccination is declining in all Member States. This goes back to fake news about allegedly horrible side effects of vaccinations that are not true. We know our vaccines are safe. Minor side effects must be taken, because the effect of the disease, which is prevented by it, can be disastrous. I almost consider it a bodily injury when parents refuse vaccination to their children for which they are responsible. They may deliver their children from a fatal illness or a disease that causes lifelong disability. We have to explain that to humans again. People have forgotten how important vaccination is. We have to teach them again. In particular, the Member States are responsible for this, they must do so. But, of course, we should have concerted action at European level.

Strengthen the legal basis of the European vaccination plan, develop a joint buying platform that already has 19 countries and needs to be developed, implement data sharing practices, for better coordination and informed coordination, to develop research on this subject in an open, transparent manner to increase citizens' confidence and also the reliability of vaccines, incorporate these measures into a wider Europe-wide health promotion plan, also taking into account, for example, animal vaccination and combating antibiotic resistance, to launch a European information and pedagogy campaign on this important issue for public health and the quality of life of Europeans, all of this we now have the tools to do.

We have achieved a lot of medical progress. Humanity today may be healthier than before, if you do not have any allergies. And that's when you feel like some people think we're immune to disease right now. But we're not at all. We must also consider that much of our good health status today is due to the fact that we know diseases, that we know counteractions and that we have also quasi eradicated diseases through vaccination — it has already been said. But they can just come back. This is very important, we must not forget it. Mr Gericke is not at all a question of pleasing to the pharmaceutical industry in any way, Mr Gericke, because it is not. It is about informing people and taking away fears about possible side effects. I believe that if all parents know what a child can possibly face when he really gets sick, and what it means to vaccinate, then most parents will decide on vaccination. As you have already said, this is the responsibility of the Member States — absolutely right. We don't want to muddger them either. But there are so many things where it's really important to point out that vaccination can save lives, and that's a fact. That doesn't mean we want to get forced vaccination.

Many others are concerned with informing and then — as has already been said — to have the Member States jointly exchange on actions, including, for example, common vaccines in the event of a disease that is not excluded — bird plague or something — so that one is armed, and then also to consider: are now intercontinental, so far worldwide connected. We cannot regulate the whole world, but in Europe we can try to make a start and really see that, not by coercion, but through information, we are getting people to actually do the best for their children in order to live a healthy life later. I also received emails from people who are vaccine-sceptical and who told me: they want to force us now. We don't want that at all. We're not trying to force, we want to enlighten.

Let me start with one remark. I vaccinate myself every year against influenza. I did it many years ago against hepatitis and yellow fever also. As a cardio-surgeon, I had an obligation to vaccinate myself. Why? Because I was responsible. Because it was dangerous for my patients if there was any possibility of my transmitting infection from me to my patients.  In response to Arne Gericke, a very simple message: let’s do it together and let’s save children’s health. When we are talking about children’s rights, about the Convention on Children’s Rights, children have the right to as high as possible a level of health protection. It does not matter that sometimes parents do not understand it, but who is responsible for saving children’s lives? Only the parents? No. We are all responsible. The state has a responsibility to guarantee conventional requirements, to implement. Of course some countries have mandatory vaccination, but more than half of European Union countries have mandatory vaccinations and calendars. That is OK. Some have only voluntary. OK. Some have a mixture. But we know very well that awareness, information and possibilities and our personal willingness to raise awareness and to be together and extend our health immunity is our own obligation also.  I am a medical doctor. For me it is very difficult to listen to today’s issues. Ms Rivasi raised some very important questions. You know that pharmacolovigilance is in place. You know that all vaccines go through very thorough scientific assessment, through WHO checks, through EMA checks. No, no, it is true. And we are always blaming conflicts of interest and showing up a bad industry. Once again there are fears in this House. Please present the evidence. That is the question. And of course we know very well that conflicts of interest should be addressed and we have a lot of tools to do this.  Speaking about general food law, we know very well we will also discuss issues about conflicts of interest. EFSA, EMA or ECDC it does not matter which. But look, that is not the main problem. The main problem is how to really encourage people and restore trust in science, and be together. You and I, we are both responsible for that. We can go on addressing issues and disseminating messages on pandemics saying these are because of industry or experts. I am sorry. What about rabies? What about zoonoses. What about Lumpy Skin Disease? What about African Swine Fever, the pandemics? We are all asking for effective vaccination for animals, but when we are talking about children, about people, immediately we raise different issues. What about rabies? We are using vaccinations and we have eliminated rabies now. Can you explain that to me by using a conspiracy theory only about bad industry? No, of course not.  I am sorry for being a little bit emotional, but people listening to you and to me also need to hear and to have common consensus that it is so dangerous, and it is such a sensitive issue to see children dying.  I would like to address issues relating to Greece. Yes, we are cooperating in a very close manner and now we have some project, which I am sorry to say is called ‘Fevers’. We have dedicated EUR 29 million to addressing the related issues. We are cooperating very closely with the Greek Government, which is in favour of addressing all therse issues. I have a good personal relationship with the Minister. I am happy about this. Thank you very much indeed generally for the constructive discussion. Your debate is also very timely in that we are showing the political importance of vaccination in Europe precisely on the eve of the World Immunisation Week. I believe we all have a collective responsibility to ensure that today’s debate is actually followed up with concrete action by the Commission, the Council and the Parliament and by each of you in your respective constituencies. I am worried that if we fail to act, children will continue to die from vaccine—preventable diseases in the 21st century. Once again it is unacceptable. I am not willing to accept that outcome. We should focus in particular on increasing vaccination coverage. The main goal is not about mandatory or voluntary, it is about possibilities to achieve a safe level of coverage, 95% or more. This is the main level, and increasing outreach to the most vulnerable groups. How many vulnerable groups are on our side? Please look at Roma issues and different situations in Romania.  We need to start increasing the compatibility of vaccination schedules, ensuring vaccination supply and, crucially, supporting Member States in their efforts to increase trust and immunisation and, of course, to register all side effects – as who can deny there ate side effects? No one. Because you have side effects when eating a meal, and with allergens you can see side effects. Side effects are a reality, there is a need to register, to be vigilant, to address, to assess the situation, to improve, there is no doubt. But do not disseminate fear about vaccines. I would like especially to thank Ms Gentile and all of you for your engagement, your passion and commitment to the subject, and in the first place the co—signatories of the motion for a resolution. You have already had the occasion to hear my views on this topic in other fora. Vaccination is a personal priority of mine, and I look forward to working closely with you in the future.

More and more parents and patients are postponing vaccination or even not having their children vaccinated at all. Diseases that were almost eradicated in Europe, such as measles, are resurrecting, with disastrous consequences. The positive effect of vaccination is irrefutable. Every vaccination counts because the better the population is vaccinated, the harder a germ can spread. It is actually a question of solidarity so that people with reduced resistance can also be protected. It is also unacceptable for years of medical progress to be undercut by misleading information.
