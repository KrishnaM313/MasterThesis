Today we are embarking on a new European future for Moldova and its people, the future that has actually always been destined for Moldova. There is no doubt that Moldova is a European country and a part of European culture. It makes me extremely happy to be in a position to say that Moldova fully deserves this historic shift. Today’s ratification is the culmination of the work started by Moldova and the European Union nearly ten years ago with the initiation of the EU-Moldova Action Plan. However at that time the implementation of this plan did not look very bright and promising in Moldova’s case. Five years ago the Eastern Partnership was launched by the EU and its partners, and even at that time Moldova’s record was considered to be rather lagging behind. I am particularly proud to be able to say that now Moldova stands as a front runner among our European partners and as an example of very well drafted and implemented political and socio-economic reforms. This is even more impressive when we know that this has been accomplished in only the last few years, thanks to the political determination of the Moldovan Government. Certainly any government needs the trust and support of its own people. It is therefore quite symbolic that our ratification today comes just a few weeks ahead of the general elections in Moldova. We will be looking very closely at these elections, and we call on the Moldovan authorities to ensure that the upcoming electoral process takes place according to the highest European standards. We all hope that the choice of the Moldovan people will be one that leads to the further building of a free society and a market-based economy. By implementing the European-Moldovan Association Agreement, this part of Europe will be more stable and prosperous. In principle this has to be the ultimate goal and in the interest of everyone in the region. It is to my deep regret, however, that this is not a strategy shared by everyone. Just as we state in the accompanying resolution – which has been adopted by the Committee on Foreign Affairs and for which I also ask the consent of the European Parliament today – we are concerned about Russia’s actions aimed at undermining the association process of the EU’s Eastern Partnership. We once again reiterate our conviction that the association process is not a threat to Russia’s political and economic interest, and it is to be truly regretted that the Russian leadership wishes to regard it as such. As we all know, the Association Agreement is an extremely complex document that brings responsibilities for both sides. In other words, it is equally the obligation of the European Union to assist Moldova in fighting corruption, fostering an independent judiciary, strengthening media freedom, protecting all minorities, and doing everything needed so that the Moldovan people are able to see the benefits of their European choice, such as new jobs created or the increased trade preferences that are already being afforded to Moldova as countermeasures to the use of the trade embargo by Russia. Trade volumes between the European Union and Moldova have risen by 33% in the last five or six years and that is already a real example of the benefit to people. The EU-Moldovan association agenda, if duly implemented, will open up new possibilities and is very encouraging to all of us. In conclusion, allow me to sincerely thank my colleagues in this House for their kind – and sometimes rather intense – cooperation and for being the real partners in the preparation of this report. I look forward to the discussion and today’s positive vote.

Let me first of all thank the rapporteur, Mr Auštrevičius, for his excellent report, which contains many important recommendations and shows that we have a high degree of consensus on our policy with the Republic of Moldova. The people of the Republic of Moldova are aspiring to benefit from the same freedoms and stability we enjoy, and which are not self-evident for everybody on our continent. They wish to move closer to the European Union, to our unique community, and the aspirations of the people of the Republic of Moldova remind us of what the European Union has achieved over the last decades. We enjoy democracy, the rule of law, prosperity, peace and absence of major threats to our sovereignty. Our focus on the Republic of Moldova is important. The Republic of Moldova is showing a determination to bring its European agenda forward. For this reason, in cooperation with High Representative/Vice-President Frederica Mogherini I have chosen to make my first visit as Commissioner for Neighbourhood Policy and Enlargement Negotiations to Chișinău. I was able to sign an agreement with Prime Minister Leancă to provide up to EUR 400 million for the years 2014 to 2017, in particular to accompany the implementation of the DCFTA, provided it is adopted by you today. The Republic of Moldova is often called the front-runner of the Eastern Partnership, for it has achieved so much in a short period of time in its bilateral relations with the European Union. We have negotiated with record speed the all-encompassing Association Agreement, including its highly complex Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. The Republic of Moldova is the first country of the Eastern Partnership that has a visa-free regime. I am proud to be here today so that we can together take a key step in Moldova’s political association and economic integration with the European Union. Our Association Agreement represents a fundamental intensification and elevation of our relations. Our ties now go far beyond what they were under the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, but the Association Agreement and the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area are instrumental in enhancing transparency, fostering economic growth, and supporting stability and prosperity. Let me emphasise again that in this process we are guided by our core values which we put at the service of all citizens, citizens who deserve improved life standards which can be achieved only through sustainable and inclusive development in the country and in the region.  With the upcoming parliamentary elections on 13 November, Moldova is facing an important moment in its recent history. The holding of free and fair parliamentary elections is a key event in the country’s democratic life. The EU stands ready to continue its close cooperation with the future democratically-elected Moldovan government that wishes to pursue this path. Moreover, we are looking forward to a new impetus to the ambitious reform agenda after the elections. Corruption needs to be fought, the justice and law enforcement systems need thorough modernisation, and the business and investment climate needs to be improved. Only these key reforms will allow the country to unfold its full economic development potential. The EU will support Moldova in these endeavours. During my recent visit to Chișinău, as I already said, I was able to sign this financial agreement for the new EU programme, in particular to strengthen small and medium sized companies, develop the national legislation in line with EU quality standards and promote export and investment opportunities.  Let me stress that the Association Agreement is concluded with the whole Republic of Moldova but it cannot be effectively implemented yet on its entire territory. We hope for the possibility of applying the Agreement, and in particular the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area, to all of its territory, provided the Republic of Moldova ensures its full implementation and enforcement. This, and visa liberalisation, plus our confidence-building measures across the River Dniestr, underpin our commitment to help Moldova overcome the division of the country.  We have also shown to Moldova that the EU is a reliable partner when it is faced with unjustified external pressure. We have increased our tariff-free quotas for the import of specific Moldovan foods and vegetables. In August we inaugurated the gas interconnector between Iași and Ungheni and we stand ready to support the construction of the pipeline to Chișinău. Moreover, Moldova is the country receiving the highest EU aid per capita in the Eastern Neighbourhood. Let me conclude by saying that today’s ratification of our Association Agreement with the Republic of Moldova represents a major achievement for the people of this country wanting to benefit from the same values, security and prosperity as us, but also for the EU’s foreign policy in its Eastern Neighbourhood. The Association Agreement is a milestone on Moldova’s path towards the Union.

I will briefly summarise the reasons why I strongly believe we should support this agreement. First and foremost because it is a free choice, a free people, free Europeans on either side of the EU-Moldova border. I do hope that the age of geopolitical carve-outs of countries and territories has forever come to an end in Europe, and then nobody can possibly oppose the free will of free people democratically represented.  From a more purely economic point of view, the agreement, and the DCFTA bit in it, opens a whole world of opportunity for the Moldovan economy. It will have access to the biggest market on the planet. It will create incentives for FDI flows into the Moldovan economy, which should be transformed, modernised, evolved towards a high-value-added type of economy. The transformation of institutions provided for by the DCFTA will also create a more stable environment for Moldovan businesses, for Moldovan citizens; there will be less scope for arbitrariness of elites of any kind.

We want to continue the good neighbourliness with Moldova and its people. As the European People's Party, we are also proud of the work of our party friends in government: Prime Minister Iurie Leancé has done a great job. The citizens of Moldova are already experiencing the first successes, such as visa-free travel to the European Union. But these days we are particularly moved by Russian pressure on our neighbours. Moscow's perfidious, continued aggression in eastern Ukraine – especially in recent days – must lead to an appropriate response from the international community! We want to give the citizens in our eastern neighbourhood a free choice about their social, economic and social model and their foreign policy orientation, and we also accept their decision. Our experience – that is, the experience of the 28 – is that our model in the European Union is particularly appropriate to the people and the European nations. We are happy to help Moldova realise its desire to participate in European life in the European Union, and I hope that in a few years' time it will be ready.  The process is demanding. Moldova has already done a great deal, but much remains to be done! The small country has begun a particularly hard process of transformation because of its history, and we are happy to help it continue. But we also expect the necessary changes and reforms in the rule of law and in the state administration, because they are a prerequisite for the functioning of the European model in all areas of life, so that citizens can achieve their objectives as citizens, as economic operators and as European citizens.

With the ratification of the Association Agreement and the Free Trade Agreement, this Parliament says 'yes' to free trade, which can bring more prosperity for all, and 'yes' to intensive cooperation and to support our friends in Moldova in reshaping their country. This transformation is not taking place because we want it to happen, but for the good of the people there, because they themselves want it, because the people of Moldova want to live in another country, namely in a country with independent justice, with independent media, with transparent administrative action, with the dismantling of corruption, with a social market economy and the recognition of the rights of minorities. We can and want to help and advise on this – as the EU, as Parliament and the Commission. But the parties, the civil society organisations, should also be involved. Because if politicians agree, that alone is not enough. An entire population, civil society, must be there. We will continue to act actively, as we have done so far, with financial support, but also with visa facilitation, which is a major step forward. Moldova will be elected on 30 November. We are not in a state of need to give any advice as to who to choose. But it is important for us to see whether the people of Moldova really want to go down the European path. Just as Armenia has chosen a different path, Moldova is a sovereign state and has chosen the path towards Europe for itself. Once again, even though I am in Moscow next week, we will keep saying that these treaties are not against anyone, not even the Russian Federation. We do not want to move bloc borders to the Russian border, but we want to work towards our long-term goal of achieving a free trade area between Lisbon and Vladivostok.

There is no better time to conclude an Association Agreement between the European Union and Moldova. This will inspire new powers in Moldova's quest to fit politically and economically into the European Union. For most people in Moldova, the European Union is synonymous with prosperity, stability and democracy, and it is our duty to provide the moldovan authorities with the opportunity to choose the path on which way they will continue.  The agreement with Moldova is also of utmost importance to me as a Bulgarian. You know that in the southern part of Moldova in the Taraklya region 70% of the population is Bulgarian-speaking and even has a university where it is taught in its native language.  Already in the 19th century, many Bulgarians fleeing the Ottoman Empire settled in the Bessarabia region - these are present-day Ukraine and partly Moldova, together the population there may be about 500 thousand. That is why I very much hope that Moldova will strictly and accurately fulfil its commitments to the EU and ensure the protection of the rights and freedoms, and political, ethnic minorities in the country, including the right of association, the right to use the native language and the right to self-determination. I am surprised that colleagues from the left and liberal spectrum have objected by name to the list of national minorities in Moldova, and have preferred to pay attention to others. Let's not forget the destructive role of the Republic of Turkey, which seeks to turkish a part of the Gagauzi ethnic community on the territory of Moldova.  In conclusion, I would like to state clearly that only with the protection of the democratic, social, political and economic rights of all minorities in Moldova will it be possible to ensure its territorial integrity and for the state to move forward towards deeper European integration. The EU-Moldova Association Agreement is just another step towards integrating the country and its citizens into the European model.

But let me say the following: in one monthʼs time it will be 24 years since my country signed its Association Agreement. I was privileged to be a part of those negotiations. It is therefore 24 years since we had to take on quite demanding obligations and commitments which somehow formed part of the effort of reforming our own country. This is something that is expected from Moldova. Moldova will have to do the same. It is 24 years since we had to introduce far-reaching reforms. Some of them were tough, some of them not always appreciated by the public, some of them were controversial in the political sphere. Moldova will have to do the same, it will have to pursue the path of reform. On 1 January 1993 Czechoslovakia separated. It was a peaceful separation but we had to deal with the consequences. Moldova, with the help too of the 5+2 format, will have to deal with the Transnistria problem and I think that Moldova should have our support in this respect. Twenty-four years ago – but in fact somewhat earlier, through the words of Václav Havel – we declared our objective: the objective was to join the European Communities. Moldova has the right to declare its own objective, whatever it is. Meeting the criteria should, of course, once again have our support. We behaved as a self-confident country which refused any intervention in its own sovereign rights. I think that Moldova has the same right and again it should have our support. We are going to be voting today on the Association Agreement. I think that Moldova deserves this opportunity and I think that it should have our full support. This is an opportunity. But it also has the right to determine its future destiny and I think that it is very important today to make it absolutely clear, through our voting, that Moldova does have our support.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has Almost a year ago, the last summit of the Eastern Neighbourhood took place. In Vilnius, Commissioner Füle, who was responsible for this policy area at the time, wanted the big throw, the whole package. In essence, from the EU's point of view, the entire post-Soviet area should be reorganised through association and free trade agreements. The implementation of this objective became politically a matter of date, which was sacrificed much, including the self-proclaimed goal of conditionality and the sober answer to the question: are the companies in question really ready for this decision in view of its scope? The answer is not a blanket one. Our eastern neighbours are also not necessarily comparable. However, it is precisely with the experience of Ukraine that I am concerned about Moldova, and it is difficult for me to give my unreserved support to the agreement. In analogy with other countries, the agreements to be decided have not been discussed extensively and sufficiently in Moldovan society, the contents are virtually unknown on the street. This also means that the different political elites have long been deciding from above. In the case of Moldova, this decision was rushed in the light of the forthcoming parliamentary elections. The political intention is clear: here too, the EU is being used for its own small party political gain, knowing that the consequences will be socialised anyway. This is dangerous, because Moldova is in a dangerous, difficult situation and it is difficult to see the Moldovan Government's independent contributions to its solution. The supposedly frozen Transnistria conflict is at operating temperature. There is an urgent need for clarification on a political basis, by all governments, as they are elected. Relations with Russia, but also with Ukraine, must change, and we, as the EU, must also pay attention to how the European ambitions from Bucharest are handled. Last but not least, it is clear that we are also acting in Moldova by passing the expectations of many social actors who expect a clear prospect of accession and who associate this with the Association Agreement, but who only receive standard phrases and otherwise closed doors.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 10, "date": "2014-11-13.json", "name": "Igor ŠOLTES", "mepid": "125003", "text": "  Mr President, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work. – The Association Agreement between the European Union and Moldova provides for the creation of a comprehensive free trade area, which will certainly contribute to the deep-range economic/economic cooperation between the European Union and Moldova. The Republic of Moldova is a country of just over four million inhabitants and many also live and work abroad. The reason is, of course, both economic and political.  It is an emigration that also plays an important role for the domestic situation in Moldova. The money that expats earn abroad and send home contributes about 38 per cent of Moldova's GDP, and for this reason, of course, the Greens have also tabled an amendment that moldovan expats should be given the right to take part in elections, because only then will the upcoming November parliamentary elections be held in accordance with the highest European and international standards. The media also contributes to the transparent and democratic election process. These must be objective and, during the election campaign, enable all political groups to have fair and equal access to the media. The problem that is emerging is therefore pressure from one side or the other, and there will also be the role of European observers on the part of various organisations, including Parliament, to keep a close eye on this democratic process. However, in order to make the Republic of Moldova more independent and independent, it is necessary to transform the existing energy plan in Moldova. It is necessary to focus on more efficient and renewable energy sources, because only then will it become energy independent of Russia, which represents their largest supplier in this area.  And iż for this reason, I call on you, honourable Members, that is to say, to vote against the EPP proposal to delete the fourth amendment, given by the Greens/European Free Alliance, on energy, which was adopted by the AFET Committee. And it is this amendment that encourages Moldova to reduce its energy dependence on Russia, which is also the wish of the European Union. It is therefore important to strengthen the stability of Moldova at all levels of the institutions guaranteeing democracy, the rule of law and the responsible governance of the country.

This agreement has gone through the correct parliamentary processes in good time and has been properly debated, unlike the recent Association Agreement with Ukraine, of course, which was rushed through this place in the name of political posturing.  This agreement is just one more step in the European Union’s eastward expansion and, to my mind, pays scant regard to the ongoing strain in relations with Russia. Some might suggest that it is possibly another threat to peace in Europe. Support for greater ties with the European Union in Moldova is far from universal. When a deal was signed in June thousands protested against it, not to mention another pro-Russian breakaway region in Transnistria. But, no matter what, in the words of former President Van Rompuy as Ukraine crumbled: you will do it anyway. Perhaps this is just a follow-on from when the British Prime Minister, David Cameron, spoke earlier about his desire for a European Union to stretch from the Atlantic to the Urals. Why does the European Union never learn? The European Union seems to like to model itself as the saviour of this continent from the great and savage wars that we have witnessed in the past, the sacrifices that we commemorated only this week. In the wider context of the breakdown of relations between the European Union and Russia, signing this agreement is potentially dangerous and contrary to the interests of all those who desire peace. The great continental wars should be history and what we currently see shows that the European Union’s evangelical expansionism could well prove the complete opposite.

Since the 2009 riots, Moldova has taken a number of important steps towards the country's democratisation, responsibility for its citizens and EU integration. There are a number of issues that require a solution so that Moldova is approaching the EU's standard of living more quickly, but there are issues such as the St. John's-Moldova conflict, which is the cause of the shadow economy and crime on a wider scale and which also affects the interests of EU countries. The EU can promote the integration of The Sneer in Moldova through cooperation with the de-facto government of The St. Neud in the implementation of joint projects. Facilitation of trade and travel rules with the Region of Pieds and Moldova would facilitate the integration of both regions and cooperation with the EU institutions.  Moldova is characterised by close cooperation between the business and political elites, which is the cause of the shadow economy and criminal activities. The reasons for this environment are the legacy and socio-economic situation of the Soviet Union. Promoting the independence of the executive, judiciary and legislative power and the reform process within the framework of EU-Moldova cooperation would lead to the gradual disappearance of corruption and the improvement of the business investment environment. In order to address regional issues of illegal trafficking, the fight against criminal structures, it is necessary to apply a common EU foreign policy in conflict resolution.

Our message to the people of Moldova is how extremely important it is that the benefits and advantages of this agreement are also felt by you. Once fully implemented, the agreement will provide for better consumer protection and food safety, improved access to health services, with more diverse and efficient use of energy resources and renewables, and lower energy bills. Important reform-minded governance will bring better functioning of the judiciary and a strengthened rule of law and increased transparency. This agreement will not only help Moldova integrate into the EU’s internal market and bring benefits for the business sector with more opportunities for SMEs, but it will also improve trade and investment opportunities and thus contribute to economic recovery and growth. However, this and other agreements should not be characterised as being about spheres of influence. We should signal that we wish for dialogue with Russia, not competition, in relation to what is our common neighbourhood. However Europe cannot – and must not – be deterred from advancing our relations with Moldova and its neighbours if the sovereign governments of this and the other regional countries wish to do so with us.

I am pleased that the proposal has been agreed and is in the joint resolution.  Why did I insist on this? Because we are used to saying about the Republic of Moldova only that it is the model student of the Eastern Partnership, a thing repeated today. Is that enough? Does that reflect what has happened in the last few years in the small republic? The formula says something about the efforts of the pro-European coalition, which has ruled the country for the past five years, but it says little about the fierce opposition to blocking these efforts made by the Party of Communists of Moldova, a party with an organizational culture inspired by pure and harsh Stalinism. It is right that in terms of admiration for Russia, the Party of Communists was surpassed only by the Party of Socialists. Yes, colleagues, Moldova is the only place in the world where the Socialists are left to the Communists.  We have become accustomed, on the other hand, to associate Moldova and Ukraine. Including in our documents, time and time again, we copied the formulas used for Kiev in the texts about Chisinau. I think it's time to unplug them. Just as Slovenia was separated in the late 1990s from the other countries, smaller or larger, built on the ruins of the former Yugoslavia, and Moldova must now be separated from the other eastern neighbours, which appeared after the collapse of the former USSR. Otherwise, the principle of more for more does not make sense, because Moldova is more legally advanced and more politically stable not only towards the other members of the Eastern Partnership, but also towards other countries in the Western Balkans.

Your frantic appetite for enlargement leads the peoples of Europe into the wall of savage competition and social dumping. And what more tragic example than that of the opening of the European Union to Moldova? This nation has already benefited from European generosity between 2007 and 2014 for an amount of more than one billion euros. It is one of the poorest countries on the continent, with nearly 30% of its population living below the poverty line and the minimum wage is painfully high at 43 euros per month. Worse, in Moldova, whose integration efforts you praise in your angelic report, the underground economy accounts for almost 40% of GDP. In addition, you strive every day to condemn the alleged misbehaviour of Russia or other countries, which would not respect the creed of human rights.

Moldova is ready for this, as exempled by the development of rules for visa liberalisation, which has resulted in 300 000 Moldovans visiting Europe since April this year. But we must also bear in mind our European obligations to Moldova. This means wisely showing that the benefits for Moldovans will begin not only after they enter the Union, but now. Russian propaganda, where Europe is scared, must be weakened. This means helping to implement projects using the European Neighbourhood Instrument to invest in infrastructure and the economy, in the development of small businesses and digital start-ups, but also in developing modern, transparent state-to-citizen relationships and supporting civil society and an independent judiciary. This means supporting projects to reduce Moldova's dependence on Russian gas. This means the development of economic cooperation, the fruitful use of open trade gates, in order to reduce dependence on the Russian economy also on the labour market, so that Moldova does not have to work on such a scale in Russia. This means a jump in erasmus+ youth exchanges, but also an openness to cooperation in science – because these are the foundations of modern development – within the framework of projects and neighbourhood policy measures well run by an experienced Commissioner such as Commissioner Hahn.

After 10 years of Polish's membership of the European Union, it seems to me that nothing like this has happened, that Polish farmers, in solidarity with other farmers in the European Union, are also oversue for the difficulties posed by the situation, including the Russian embargo.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 49, "date": "2014-11-13.json", "name": "Miroslav POCHE", "mepid": "124699", "text": "  Mr President, unfortunately, the crisis in Ukraine has largely overshadowed developments in Moldova.

Our discussion has confirmed that we agree on the need to continue strongly supporting the Republic of Moldova moving closer to the European Union. At the same time, we need to send clear messages on the need to enhance reform efforts after the elections. We will now focus on the thorough implementation of the agreement, which contains a very ambitious reform agenda.  The full benefits of the agreement will only be available to the Moldovan people if we pursue these paths. It is moreover clear that the European Union will stand by Moldova in the present difficult regional situation. Successfully implemented reforms will make Moldova less vulnerable to external pressure. I also want to reiterate the Union’s support for a solution to the Transnistrian conflict within the framework of the 5+2 talks, respecting Moldova’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally-recognised borders, and the special status of Transnistria. In response to several speakers: the EU through its projects supports all minorities and regions mentioned today. I was asked by Mr Marinho e Pinto about how we control and audit the projects. I think it is important to recall that it is about bilateral funding, which is transferred to Moldova through budget support. Payments are made by the Commission only against delivery of concrete results agreed bilaterally between the Government of Moldova and the European Union. As it plays an important role in the Moldovan economy and today’s debate, some clarifications concerning wine. It is indeed highly regrettable, I have to say, that Russia has stopped importing a whole range of agricultural products, not only wine, for purely political reasons, because if it comes to the quality of the wine it is an outstanding one. But your information that the Union is not allowing imports of wine is wrong. In fact it does so, both under the current autonomous trade preference, and now also under the new DCFTA. In fact the DCFTA tariff-free quota has been doubled for exports. Finally, Moldova is a key country of the European Union’s Eastern Partnership.

I stress that, on the other hand, it is the joint effort of all the Member States and in no way the merits of the Ponta government, as stated by a Romanian MEP, a member of the Socialist group. Moldova will continue its European route, and signals in this direction are already being felt. Europe has the necessary mechanisms to guarantee economic growth, modernise deficient sectors, or harness its specific development potential.

The request derogates from the EGF Regulation (Article 4(1)(a)), which requires 500 people to be made redundant for the mobilisation of the fund. I believe that the exceptional circumstance, given the influence that these redundancies have on the employment and economy of the Rathkeale area, the company's headquarters, under economically difficult conditions, justifies the derogation.

Given that, in mid-2014, unemployment in Greece exceeded 26 per cent, a further mass redundancy could create disastrous effects on the entire Greek economy.

For Greek exporters, service companies and the tourism industry, the euro has become a programme of destruction of livelihoods, suffering in particular among unemployed young people.  A European Globalisation Adjustment Fund gives the false impression that globalisation is something negative to compensate for. Globalisation does not only bring positive economic effects in the form of goods, services and investment. It also spreads good ideas, values and morals. Globalisation has ensured that, in addition to the idea of a market economy, democracy and universal human rights are becoming more and more widespread.

It is essential that civil society as a whole, especially women, participates in peace negotiations and develops post-conflict solutions that will allow the reconstruction of the country. Equally fundamental is an international arms embargo which has been imposed in this region for years, and we also call for respect for human rights.
