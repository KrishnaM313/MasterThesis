Even more, the ILO is a key partner for our external policies.  The European Union promotes the ratification and implementation of ILO Conventions and relies on ILO supervision of labour standards, in particular core labour standards, and in the monitoring of trade association enlargement and development agreements. Therefore, having a well-functioning ILO standard supervisory system is important for us since its conclusions are crucial to assessing compliance with international labour standards. And here we have a problem, due to the fact that since 2012 the supervision of labour standards cannot be carried out properly.  Why not? Because employers’ and workers’ representatives at the ILO disagree on whether or not the right to strike is protected under ILO Fundamental Convention No 87, the Convention concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise Convention. Secondly, employers’ and workers’ representatives also disagree on the capacity of the ILO supervisory bodies to decide on the scope of the right to strike, its limits and the conditions for its legitimate exercise. Beyond this there is, as well, a risk of endangering the tripartite relationships and weakening the ILO supervisory system.  As the Commissioner in charge of relations with the International Labour Organisation, I am deeply concerned about these developments and that is why I followed the discussion at the ILO very closely. I personally met the ILO Director-General, Mr Guy Ryder, last week who informed me of the most recent developments. However, as you know, the European Union is only an observer at the ILO. The Commission will therefore not intervene on the substance of the discussion. These matters fall within the competence of the Member States.  The recognition of the right to strike in ILO Convention No 87 is a delicate matter. At the last session of the ILO Governing Body, also thanks to European Union coordination in approximating their positions, the EU Member States were ready to support the option of asking the International Court of Justice for a clarification of the matter so that we can move forward and resolve this pending disagreement between employers’ and workers’ representatives. A tripartite meeting will take place in the ILO between 23 February and 25 February, the last week of this month, to discuss the issue.  The Commission is ready to support all players and provide information to feed into the discussion, notably by retrieving information on the situation regarding the right to strike in the European Union.

Madam President, Commissioner, it is clear that the right to strike is a fundamental right, constituting our democratic systems. Although it is not the direct competence of the European Union, there are many texts - such as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union or the European Social Charter - which prove the Union's commitment to social dialogue and this right.  Article 28, the Charter of Fundamental Rights guarantees employees the right to negotiate and enter into collective agreements at appropriate levels and to resort, in the event of conflicts of interest, to collective actions in defence of their interests, including strike action. In this regard, the reference is clearly the International Labour Organization (ILO), and in particular its Convention No. 87, as well as the interpretation of the committee of experts, which is recognized at the world level.  To address problems that could arise in this area, the ILO has set up a freedom of association committee and also the Committee on the Application of Standards, with experts. Over the past 60 years, these bodies have worked perfectly, in an ideal way. They have always been recognized by the three components of the International Labour Organization and have made it possible to find compromises for the benefit of the various parties.  Unfortunately, since 2012, we have had to see that the process is somewhat overt and that the social partners are no longer able to reach an agreement. The European Union has always had a clear and wanted position to promote social dialogue. The current blockage is therefore problematic, in that it calls into question social dialogue.  I therefore hope that the Commission will do its utmost to weigh its weight in order to enable the ILO to break this deadlock. If, however, this is not possible, the only way will be to seek an opinion before the International Court of Justice in The Hague.

The Social Charter is part of the Lisbon Treaty. We have learned in Europe that successful economies are those with a strong social partnership. But a strong social partnership also means: social partners on an equal footing. And eye-level also means that we have strong trade unions. This includes the right to strike. In recent years, there have been repeated attacks on the right to strike in Europe. Within the framework of the Troika, the right to strike in the crisis countries was also restricted by conditions. Time and again I hear and read about trends in Europe that there are institutions, parties and employers' associations that want to reform and weaken this right to strike. This weakens the negotiating basis of the trade unions. For us it is clear: Defend the beginnings! The attack on a first fundamental right in Europe can have a domino effect and also restrict other rights.

I understand fully the concerns of some people with regard to the right to strike. I think it is very important to bring together the interests of both employers and employees while negotiating, and also to have respect for subsidiarity. Companies should have the possibility to input their employees all over Europe so companies are able to compete with other companies in the Single market.  We would like to give them new opportunities for growth and companies should be protected against unfair competition through bad employers who escape their responsibilities. At the same time we should protect vulnerable employees. But it should not become almost impossible for honest companies to set up activities all over Europe.  Viewing the great difference between different Member States, we cannot have a one-size-fits all pattern; that does not work. We hope the Commission is aware of this and will also pay attention to the different approaches necessary in a partial, targeted revision of the Posted Workers Directive.

It now appears that employer groups within the ILO no longer support the interpretation of the Committee of Experts on this particular convention. The jurisprudence of the ILO has stood for 60 years on this convention and has interpreted the right to strike as an intrinsic corollary to the right to organise. This right has been recognised internationally as a fundamental right of workers and their organisations. The freedom to associate, to organise, to bargain collectively, make it possible to ensure decent working conditions. Collective bargaining is a mechanism that helps to ensure beneficial outcomes for workers and productive solutions for employers. Collective bargaining can only be achieved by the freedom to organise, and one of those freedoms is the right to strike – as a last resort, to withdraw labour. Without that right it is like having really good legislation in place but no sanctions for non-compliance. Collective bargaining has no proper foundation without the right to strike. With regard to the current situation, as the Commissioner said, there will be a tripartite meeting at the end of February to try to resolve the current impasse. You, Commissioner, have outlined very clearly the current situation and the willingness of the Commission to support all players by supplying information from the EU, where the right to strike is fundamental. However, cases like Rüffert, Laval, etc. and the thorny issue of the posting of workers may have sown some of the seeds of this dissent, and we need to finally sort out that matter.

Their representatives constantly demand compliance with what is agreed when it comes to financial management, but forget what is agreed when it comes to the protection of fundamental rights, in particular economic and social rights. A final example is the Troika's insistence, in the last negotiation with the previous Greek government, to abolish in practice the right to strike in Greece. The Troika has demanded the establishment of a law allowing a strike only if an absolute majority of workers are concentrated, which is impossible, especially in tertiary national trade unions.

The Conventions, particularly Nos 87 and 98, are, as people have said, about the balance of power within the workplace and they represent hard fought-for rights. That struggle, as we know, is still going on in some of our Member States, but certainly in many countries throughout the world, in sectors such as mining, brick-making and textiles. So any rollback of the definition of these rights that people have has profound implications for those who care about human rights, about decent work and about fair competition. So I think that the employers’ group needs to seriously consider what message it is sending elsewhere in the world through this action. For the European Union, the ILO core Conventions are part of GSP+, increasingly part of our trade agreements and therefore, for us, they represent a whole set of values and a way of working. We want to end exploitation, we want an end to unfair competition, undercutting through labour standards. So we have to support the right of organised labour and that includes the right to withdraw labour without being sacked, black-listed, beaten up or even worse, in many countries of the world.  So the ILO has a crucial role to play here and that social partnership has a crucial role to demonstrate the sort of standards, the sort of progress that can be made through negotiation and, where necessary, the right to strike.

Unfortunately, however, especially in recent years, citizens' rights have been buried by much biggest interests, by financial interests, by great speculation, and all this very often generates protest, generates a sense of dissatisfaction.  Let us not forget that there are so many citizens and workers in Europe, those who are still left, who live below the poverty line, people who have lost their jobs, people who have lost their homes, people who live on the streets, people who have nothing to feed their children, children who stop going to school. Protest is the consequence.  Of course, an attempt is being made to put a remedy and a stop to the people who are protesting. So we saw what happened last year in Greece, when teachers were protesting and the then Prime Minister denied the right to strike on the grounds that there could obviously be social unrest and with this excuse he took away the right to strike. I saw it with my own eyes a few months ago, in Rome, when the Ast workers went to protest the steel works crisis and were loaded by the police, they were beaten. I saw guys I knew well to be beaten. That's what can happen.  The right to strike is a sacrosanct right that no one can take away from anyone, which workers must see protected. I would expect that in 2015 those rights that have been won over by others, that have bequeathed them to us, were not even an opportunity for arguments or comparisons. The rights, the inalienable rights, those that we have won, those that others before us and for us have won, must not be taken away from people in the slightest.

Allow me to present to you a proposal which the Commission adopted last Wednesday on youth employment. Since I came to office as the new Commissioner for Employment, Social Affairs, Skills and Labour Mobility, I have made the fight against youth unemployment my first priority. More than five million young people in Europe do not have a job at this moment. This is around one in five of young people in Europe. In some Member States we are facing youth unemployment rates of around 50%. Moreover, today 7.5 million people between 15 and 24 years old are not in employment, education or training and risk being socially and economically excluded, with all the dramatic consequences for themselves and for our society. This is unacceptable. This is why, in its Work Programme for 2015, the Commission committed to taking initiatives to promote integration and employability in the labour market, including measures to support Member States in getting young people into work. As you know, the Youth Employment Initiative was established following the urgent call from the European Council in February 2013 to address the unprecedented levels of youth unemployment in certain regions of the European Union most affected by this phenomenon. This budget line of EUR 3.2 billion, to be matched with funding from the European Social Fund, is dedicated to actions targeting individual young people who are neither in employment, education or training. Therefore, it contributes to the implementation of the Youth Employment Guarantee, in line with the Council’s recommendation of 22 April 2013. However, despite the provisions already in place to frontload this initiative, and an early eligibility date for expenditure – 1 September 2013 – progress has not yet lived up to expectations. The initial pre-financing amount of 1% – and 1.5% in the Member States in the programme – proved to be too low to roll out the initiative, particularly to those Member States that have significant budgetary constraints. This proposal aims, therefore, to tackle this deficiency by setting an adequate level of pre-financing for the Youth Employment Initiative. The increased financing proposed will amount to around EUR 1 billion – 30% of the specific allocation – instead of the current EUR 39 million. Based on the targets set by Member States in their operational programmes, we expect that, with this additional pre-financing, up to 650 000 young people will be able to rapidly receive support. I would like to underline again that the pre-financing proposal does not impact on the budgetary allocations for the Youth Employment Initiative in 2015, or the multiannual financial framework overall. Neither does it affect pre-financing payments from other funds or under operational programmes that are not relevant for the initiative.

What you are doing and also the initiative of the Commission and President Junker, who has always paid particular attention to youth unemployment, also have the full support of the European People's Party. I am convinced that having more money and more funding is a very good instrument. The problem we see, particularly with regard to the Member States, is how this money is used, how all the extremely positive initiatives that Europe is taking towards the Member States are being taken on board. The Youth Guarantee Fund, which I consider to be an excellent experience, has also not been transposed and adopted in the best possible way by all the Member States; some have made copy-pastes of ads in temporary agencies. This is extremely wrong. We do not need to have a copy-paste, we young people need confidence, we need to be able to believe in this Europe too, and what you are giving is a great message of hope. What I am asking you very much, not least because Italy, my country, is particularly well known for not spending the money that the European Union gives well, is to be very careful about controlling this funding that we give directly to young people and indirectly to the States, because if they are not spent well they must no longer be given. They must be made to those who are efficient and to whom they are effective in this expenditure. I therefore congratulate you.

We know what amazing things our young people are capable of when they get the opportunity, but we also know how much they can suffer if young people are not given the chance to develop their job potential in a timely manner. The aim of the guarantee is to ensure that young people do not remain inactive for more than four months and receive a job, traineeship or continue to be educated. To this end, resources are now being released and the instruction is: rapid implementation. But do Member States have the capacity to make meaningful use of them? Unfortunately, the answer to this question is not unequivocal. I understand if the Commission needs to show that it is actionable and fast, but my concerns about the unreasonable use of accelerated payments remain. The programme is in danger of going down the easiest path: by nonsensical subsidisation of hastily created, unfortunately, many temporary jobs. The problem with unemployment does not start at the labour office, but much, much earlier. For example, when a child from a poor social background does not get into kindergarten, when the child gets to school, but for years he learns the old and untapped theory. When in college they have no idea about working with real business. And when, in the worst case scenario, graduates in the office end up working and meeting people there who don't know how to help them. Did you know, for example, that in Slovakia there are sometimes up to 700 unemployed per official?  Therefore, if today the Commission is proud of the speed of its work, I am rather afraid of dishonesty. I consider it not fair enough to deal with employment in the regions with the greatest problems in a hastily questionable implementation capacity. I find it equally questionable to add often clueless states with funds to subsidise jobs.  I understand the Commission's intention, but I am concerned about the result in reality. I will therefore pay particular attention, together with my colleagues, to setting up a control system.

I agree and also add that the second necessary need is a change of mentality. The Czech philosopher Václav Belgrade said that work is not any activity, but only one that changes the world. In fact, if we are looking for a way to involve hundreds of thousands of unemployed young people in Europe in the workforce, we are looking for a way for these young people to change our world, our Europe. It's a journey from passivity to activity. Change must occur not only in the support system, but also, quite necessarily, in our attitude to work. Not all elite lawyers, proclaimed doctors, or world politicians can be. We need a great job in services as urgently as good craftsmen and skilled workers. The youth unemployment situation is alarming in some countries and threatens the economic stability of the whole of Europe. It is therefore high time to stop lowering the age limits of vulnerable groups and start motivating young people to self-sufficiency, economic independence from their parents or the state.

Is it clear what the vast suffering of more than 7 million young people, deprived of work and activity, represents behind the coldness of the figures?

I was filling in forms, calculating how much money I had for my rent, food, train tickets and health insurance. I was thinking about my life, my dreams, what plans I had for my future, and I thought about my place in society: where do I belong? I have always been in a privileged position. I come from a country where youth unemployment is proportionately low. I come from a middle class, white family and I have a university degree. Still, the ultimate question that was always there in my mind was: what is my value for this society? Raised in an environment and an educational system where having a job is a synonym for being valuable, millions of young people probably ask themselves exactly the same question every day. Every day, young people are asking themselves what they have done wrong when people are telling them that they just need to try harder. People are telling them to try harder when trying harder is just not enough anymore. We need to make this very clear. This is not an individual problem of Paolo from Minorca or Kasia from Cracow. It is a systematic problem that was brought about by wrong political decisions in the past. Every day, especially in times of more and more alarming information leaking about tax fraud and tax avoidance, young people are asking themselves if we are doing enough to solve these problems, if we are willing to learn from LuxLeaks and Swiss Leaks and change a system that brings these problems every day. What we need is a fairer tax system and public investment to start this process. Strengthening the Youth Guarantee, as proposed by the Commission now, is only one step on a long and winding road to a solution, because eventually we will have to decide if we are standing side by side with the many million young people who are unemployed and desperate or if we support the interests of the few, yet powerful, people and companies hiding their wealth in tax havens and avoiding paying their share. When I was sitting in the unemployment office, one year ago, I took my decision. I would fight for the many who are often overheard and overlooked. Now I am in a position to speak to you, Mrs Thyssen, directly, and I want to say you, and to all your colleagues in the Commission, that this is only a first step. What we need now is, first, for you to push the Member States to really implement the Youth Guarantee in a way that will directly benefit young people, but secondly – and I think this is even more important – to push for policies that are going to take the European Union on a different path and that will really create employment so that young people have a future in Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 58, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Jane COLLINS", "mepid": "124955", "text": "  on behalf of the EFDD Group. – Madam President, what we are debating here is the European Youth Initiative, and we have calls for the EU to do this, that and the other to end the massive problems facing young people in finding a job. I suppose this is the same EU that has failed those young people. You only have to look at the employment figures for the Mediterranean eurozone members to realise that the EU and its initiatives have led to millions of young people being unable to find work, with Greece being the prime example with a 50% youth unemployment rate. We have seen billions of taxpayers’ money thrown at these countries and none of it has helped. How about Northern Europe? Well, of course, the elephant in the room there is immigration. While we have to compete with an open door to 450 million people to settle claim benefits and, crucially for this debate, compete for the same jobs, it will always be hard for young people to find work. At the last European committee meeting we were talking about new legislation on EURES, which is a website that hit the headlines in the UK a few years ago for advertising 800 000 UK jobs across Europe. That was nearly 50% of all the jobs listed. The new rules obviously will expand the number of UK jobs listed and advertised, but more importantly, the EU wants to include work experience and apprenticeship places advertised across Europe as well. How on earth are young British workers and those fresh-faced out of education, with little experience or skills, meant to find a job? The EU, whatever it does, makes things worse.

More than 23% of young people under the age of 25 in France are currently unemployed. This social drama is the direct result of political choices which have had the effect of curbing the economic activity of many Member States: strong euro, ultraliberalism, lack of Community or even national preferences, lack of protection of vital economic sectors, continuation of a mad policy of total openness of borders. These many factors have had a very negative impact on employment. So, as a good arsonist, the Commission is now proposing to release EUR 1 billion under the Youth Employment Initiative. But this financial windfall will be just another blow in the water. Indeed, it is not enough to help young people find their first job or to train, it is first necessary to restore the conditions for a sustainable economic recovery, creating sustainable jobs. We must also stop the strengthening of the Eures network, which aims to support the one-way mobility of European workers. This European employment platform should not be a facilitator for the hiring of low-cost seconded workers, who compete directly - and in a totally unfair way - with employees in Member States such as France.

After what we have just heard, I think we must thank you for identifying the real problem here, with the youth employment initiative, which is the problem of co-financing Member States. You have fully understood that it is in the states where the budget is most difficult to balance that we need the most to help young people enter the world of work. These are Greece and Spain, regions in great difficulty, for which the youth employment initiative was created. It is through this volunteerism that you have highlighted the difficulty and undertaken to respond effectively to it. There is an urgent need to integrate young people into employment. It is a very big problem and there is a great deal of confusion on the ground, as well as here in the debates. There is a great confusion between the Youth Guarantee, which is the policy of integrating young people into the world of work throughout Europe and for all young Europeans, and the youth employment initiative, which is strengthening the youth guarantee. I hear a lot about the $21 billion, the $6 billion, the $3 billion, etc. We need to target the youth employment initiative, aimed at those who are most in difficulty, in the most troubled areas, and you are doing it perfectly. Mobility is essential, because the living and working space of young people is the European space. No professional sector will be spared this European opening. In their profession, in their lives, young people need mobility. It is our first instrument to fight unemployment. Commissioner, you have asked us to help you. You can count on us, we will help you strengthen the pre-financing of youth employment. Help us, however, to eliminate the confusion that reigns in the minds, including those of ministers and heads of state and government: the youth guarantee is valid for all, while the youth employment initiative is a supplement for those who need it most.

We will get an allocation of 68 million in Ireland for the YEI and a further 68 million under the Social Fund. I think it is important to say that this pre-financing – all of this money – is available to Member States and it can be used to support, not just the provision of traineeships and internships and apprenticeships, further education, training, etc., but also business set-up, support for entrepreneurs and targeted wage and recruitment subsidies.

They emphasised to me the need to deal with demand as well as supply and pointed out that virtually no jobs are being created in the public service in Ireland.

In five years, the unemployment rate among young Europeans has increased from 15% to 25%. In Italy, youth unemployment is as high as 50%.  And yet, in the face of this social disaster, you are here to have the usual chatter and the young people who listen to us from home, from home because they do not have a job, will hear an hour of words, an hour of tired or ugly rhetoric. Do you want to understand that for the unemployed, the European Treaties, Europe 2020, the Youth Initiative are empty and useless words? Do you want to understand that there are too few funds if only in Italy there are 729,000 young people between the age of 15 and 24 out of work? Do you want to understand that using these funds is difficult because projects require pre-financing from the national budget and then repaid, and is it difficult to do so if Europe itself places budgetary constraints on Greece or Italy, for example, countries where unemployment is highest? The problem for europe's unemployed is Europe, this Europe: the single market, the euro, out-of-control immigration. There is therefore only one recipe for giving young people hope: putting Europeans back at the centre of social policies, protecting our businesses, immediately revising the suffocating parameters of the wrong European treaties, which should not even be applied in Italy because they run counter to the Italian Constitution.

It is true that there has been a turning point in the European Union and that youth unemployment is slowly declining. The 2014 data are clear: youth unemployment has fallen by 1.7% through the European Union as a whole. And that equates to 464,000 young people under the age of twenty-five unemployed less than the previous year, of whom 82,000 are Spanish, or 17.67% of the European total. However, the current situation remains unacceptable. The Commissioner said so: more than five million young people remain unemployed. Many of them are Spanish. The European Union is not alone able to deal with this scourge with guarantees, but it must play a key role in helping national reforms and efforts be rewarded with stimulus that boosts growth and employment among young people, and that allows important employment-promoting measures to be taken in countries such as Spain , more opportunities can be provided for young people, as is the case with the proposal we are discussing today. Although the Youth Employment Initiative was launched as a shock plan, many Member States are struggling to implement the necessary measures, showing that initial pre-financing was not sufficient to be able to take swift and effective action, even more so when the budget is concentrated in the first two years and needs to be absorbed quickly and effectively. However, the Commission has been able to react, and this increase by almost EUR 1 billion is a good example of this.

They cannot be just procurement promotion policies for businesses, which also sometimes distort the labour market. We have young people who haven't even finished basic education and we have to think about giving it back to them. Third, implementation is critical.

Those States that had difficulty in funding the first phase of the Youth Guarantee will surely appreciate it. But I have two issues which my group is currently concerned about in an important way. The first is that, beyond the fact that you can increase pre-financing, there is a clear problem of how the Youth Guarantee is being implemented, and we would like the European Commission to monitor, much more closely, how the Youth Guarantee develops in its content and practical application. In the case of Spain, one of the great beneficiaries of the measure, there are some autonomous communities that have not yet implemented the measure. We continue to devote much of the resources to bonuses, which contradicts the Youth Guarantee's own objectives and, in some cases, even make up unemployment lists, counting those young people who sign up for the Youth Guarantee as if they were no longer unemployed, and that process is not as automatic as some authorities applying the Youth Guarantee claim. Therefore, I would like to ask you for more control over the application, because that is what we are failing at, beyond the increase of pre-financing today. And second in every debate we must remember, there is not sufficient funding in the Youth Guarantee. The over-twenty-five years of age are still unable to access the programme, and the labor reforms we are carrying out are bearing the full weight of adjustment to the new generations. So it's no use patching like this if, then, in most labor reforms, the adjustment falls on the younger ones. And finally, a clarification which I would like you to make to me: in the multiannual financial framework approved by this Parliament, there were 2 billion margins that should be allocated, starting in 2016, to finance the Youth Guarantee was a political agreement of this Parliament. In the Juncker plan implementation programme we have now seen that these 2 billion will be used for the guarantees provided for the Juncker plan. I would like you to clarify whether that is the case and whether that money, now, will no longer be used to fund the initiative from 2016, because that would be very worrying and I certainly want you to clarify it for us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 86, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Dominique BILDE", "mepid": "124771", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the policies put in place by the European Union to promote and develop youth employment are symbols of failure.

In Spain and Greece, the youth unemployment rate even exceeds 50%.

He was referring to the immense challenge of re-warming the citizens to the European project, against the threat of eurosceptic populists. Central to this is regaining trust. And trust, colleagues, – I don't have to tell you that – disappears with containers and comes back with wheelbarrows. This proposal is just one of those wheelbarrows, because the future of the Union is an abstract fact, but the immense youth unemployment is a tragedy that is taking place today and that must be addressed now. Now is our last chance to avoid losing an entire generation of young people, my generation, to the labour market and society. For me as a young Member of the European Parliament, the frightening figures of an average of 20% youth unemployment are anything but an abstract fact. Behind these figures are the faces of tens of thousands of my peers. Young people in Spain or Italy, but also in Brussels, Hainaut or Liège. I therefore welcome the Commission's proposal to make EUR 1 billion of early release to help young people find a place in employment, traineeship or training. The European Parliament must take its responsibility in this and approve the proposal as soon as possible. Timing is crucial in this matter. As a member of the Committee on Social Affairs and Employment, I would like to make a full statement. I also call on the Member States to use these resources without any means for concrete and effective initiatives to combat youth unemployment.

The countries where young people integrate most easily into the world of work are those that have favoured apprenticeships in business. In addition to mastering a know-how, the practice of a language other than theirs optimizes the strengths of young people to enter professional life. Unfortunately, too many young people are still away from mobility in the European Union, as if this adventure were forbidden to them. Let us raise the barriers urgently and financially support the movement. I call for the creation of a system for apprentices to recognize alternating training contracts outside their home countries. The aim is, of course, to encourage them to move outside the national framework, to open up to globalisation and its challenges.

We all know that time in times of unemployment plays an extremely important role, as long-term unemployment has much greater difficulties in returning to work. Moreover, in many cases, through a lack of work and income, young people are approaching the poverty threshold overnight, the overshooing of which further exacerbates their situation and their opportunities for reinsuche.  By launching pre-funding in 2015, we are giving you the chance to intervene quickly in regions where more than 25% of young people are out of work, without any studies or training. All the more so because the lack of action in the Member States and regions where young people have been hardest hit by the crisis has often been the result of a lack of resources available.  Let us remember, however, that what the European Commission guarantees today is the availability of resources, not effectiveness in spending them. With each new multiannual financial perspective, we see a tightening of the requirements for the effectiveness of the management of European funds, which is a clear signal that not every euro spent is delivering the results it has delivered.

Two reflections that I have after listening to the debate: would it not be good if we could try to involve the social partners – that is, trade unions and businesses – not only in their own pressing problems, but actually also to engage in the youth initiative and to take a greater role in giving young people a place and a meaning.  A second reflection is that it is also very important to think long-term when it comes to young and young people's labour markets. What we are seeing now is that jobs are emerging for both young and older people in some labour markets. In the United States, 10 million new jobs have been created. But what kind of job is that? We call it precarious jobs. These are texting jobs, they are zero-hours contracts, they are jobs that neither young people nor older people can ever make a living from.

The main reason is that the Commission put the money at the disposal of the Member States but did not offer the proper means for them to use the money. Although the Youth Employment Initiative has been in place for more than a year, there are still Member States that have not yet – up to now – adopted the operational programmes that allow them to make full use of these funds. The late adoption of the European Social Fund Regulation and also of the MFF Regulation, as well as the delayed signing of the partnership agreements, also led to this situation.  Nevertheless, due to the condition imposed – to submit interim payment applications in which the European Union’s contribution from the Youth Employment Initiative is at least 50% of the additional pre-financing – some Member States might use the money for projects that do not really bring added value and might opt just to spend the money for purely statistical and mathematical reasons. The ʽhowʼ we spend the money is also important, not just the ʽifʼ we spend the money.  I would therefore like to draw attention to another issue which we will be facing next year. The entire financial envelope of the Youth Employment Initiative was frontloaded to 2014 and 2015, so next year we will have to use the global margin for commitments. But then again EUR 2 billion of this margin will be used to finance the guarantee for the European Fund for Strategic Investments and we do not know exactly how much money will be left afterwards.

It's not new, of course, the numbers are alarming. When you find out at the beginning of working age that no one wants to hire you, it's a huge burden to start life, and it turns out that the state actually failed if it runs an education system that produces the unemployed. Therefore, if even in some Member States the unemployment rate is more than 50%, then we can talk about the failure of the system. If the system fails, then the causes of this failure need to be analyzed, no random measures will bring a long-term effect. Of course, the problem of youth unemployment cannot be pulled out of context, such as the quality of the education system, but also its targeting. I have completed an internship in Singapore and their education system is incredibly targeted at young people, its strengths and problems and I think that is just what we need to target our education system.

With the Commission's proposal, we can reach over 650,000. These are the 650,000 young Europeans who will stay here and create added value precisely in Europe. I heard colleagues say, \"Not every young person can become a lawyer. Not every young person can become a doctor. Not every young person can become a star.\" Because the stars of this Union are not on the flag, but are among the young people out there.

Thank you, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, for this intense and fruitful debate. I can tell you that I share the care of the people. This is also the case for the other colleagues in the European Commission. The reality behind the figures mentioned here a few times is harrowing. Our budget is, of course, limited. We have to row with the belts we have and work with the budget that has been allocated to us. And you all know how we fought to get enough resources into the multiannh financial framework. With the resources we have, we do what we can. Especially when it comes to the youth unemployment initiative, we have made an extra effort. We have ensured that there is frontloading, so that the seven-year budget is pushed forward and that it can be used immediately. I think that's a very important thing. We have also ensured that projects eligible for funds from this fund, even those that had already started in the last quarter of 2013. We have as a rule that everything must be spent within five years, not within ten years, as is the general rule at the European Social Fund. We do not have a co-financing obligation for the Member States for this specific budget line, so that they can withdraw this money more easily. Now we are going to make sure that pre-funding increases and goes from 1 or 1.5% to 30%. So I think it will be very difficult to spend those resources even better. I therefore urge you to adopt this proposal quickly and, of course, I am making the same request to the Council. Now the question is: is that money well spent and where does it actually end up? This concern has been expressed here by several members of the European Parliament. Well, at the political level and in every bilateral contact I have had so far with ministers from the Governments of the Member States, I am raising this. Use the money, put it in, make it your work and also make sure that it is used properly, because if it is not used properly, we will act very quickly and very harshly and sanctions will be taken. My Directorate-General is doing the same and has since built up a reputation for being very efficient, always being willing to give guidance to Member States in building capacity, to give technical advice, but also to be strict, if necessary. We therefore do not hesitate to stop payments if there are reasons for doing so. I also assume that the social partners in the Member States do have a little more supervision, because according to the regulations, the social partners in the Member States are also involved in the drafting of the programme. So whoever is involved has a piece of ownership, feels called to follow what happens next. So I also count a little on the input of the social partners. As far as monitoring is concerned, the handling of the money itself, Member States have to report on the financial data three times a year. They are also required to present an annual implementation report and a first report on the Youth Employment Initiative will be published in April 2015. Towards the end of 2015, a full evaluation report will be published on the first year of the unemployment initiative, the way in which the money has been spent and the concerns expressed by the Member States. Coupled with the measure that is now before us, our initiative is to amend the ESF Regulation to allow for higher pre-financing; Member States must use the money effectively and within 12 months for the right purpose, and if they cannot prove it, they cannot prove it to the Commission, then the money will be recovered. So a lot of money is given upfront, more than we are used to, but it also makes extra sure that the money is used effectively for what it is intended for. I would also like to talk about the youth guarantee and the youth initiative. The Youth Employment Initiative, but also the Youth Guarantee – ultimately the great political objective and the great political commitment to which the Member States have committed – are closely followed in the context of the European semester. I can make it clear once again, or remind you that in the last semester exercise no fewer than 18 Member States of the Union received a country-specific recommendation on youth employment initiatives. We will continue to monitor this closely and we will also pay sufficient attention to this in the next semester exercise. But I am also very aware of colleagues – and several of you here in this House have pointed this out – that the problem will of course not be solved with this money, which is 3.2 billion, nor with the 3.2 billion extra from the ESF. With the pennies alone, we won't solve it. Solving youth unemployment is also a question of supply and demand in the labour market. So we also have to make sure that jobs are created. On the one hand, making sure that people are ready, that they have the right education, that if they are offered a job they can fill it, that they are sent to the jobs that are available, but of course there must be jobs. And that is why this Commission has been betting on a triangle from the outset. Budgetary responsibility, because we want to maintain or further strengthen financial stability. Structural reforms, including labour market reforms. And investment. We do not have to expect additional investment from governments, because they are tight in terms of finances, but there is a lot of dormant money in the private market, on the capital market, money that can be used for investment and that we need to get rid of. It is important to create attractive conditions for this. This is what we are trying to achieve, among other things, with our investment plan announced at the end of last year. That investment plan, the operation of which you have been explained here – there you had a question about Mrs Rodrigues, by the way – provides for investment in a number of key sectors, to ensure that Europe becomes competitive, but also in sectors necessary for the transition to a society, to an economy adapted to globalisation, which takes into account the digital dimension of society today. which contributes to competitive it and job creation. So I am counting on the jobs that will automatically arise by investing that money will also lead to new jobs. Europe, but especially the Member States and the regions, must then, if necessary, ensure that young people are ready to fill available jobs. Ladies and gentlemen, I think we all agree that we are talking about an immense problem here. It's not about a lost generation. We can't think about that. It's about addressing that issue and giving those young people hope, giving them prospects and giving them the opportunity, men and women, to start a life, to start a family, to make an investment, to do something in their lives. That's what we have to do. We have to make sure of that. And that's what it's all about. So for that reason I can only ask you again, help us to get this proposal through quickly. I know it's a drop in the ocean, but all the drops are helping and if everyone takes responsibility for the square metres on which they have powers, then we need to be able to tackle this problem and then we really need to be able to make sure that we give the young people perspective again.

It is worrying that the lack of work of young people can have serious consequences in the future with major financial implications. Firstly, their reintegration after a long period of rest entails numerous costs, on the other hand, the lack of activity is directly reflected in social contributions.

Obviously, some Member States do not have the resources to deal effectively with this problem, as otherwise the situation would be improving.

Many young people who are employed have a shable employment relationship that does not provide them with stability and sufficient guarantees to create normal living conditions.

No, I will speak English. Parliament has previously called on the Commission to assess potential policy initiatives aimed at reducing the barriers to cross-border employee financial participation – so-called EFP schemes – and to provide information on, and raise awareness of, the issue, as many European employees and employers, in particular SMEs, currently lack access to information on the legal and fiscal frameworks for EFP schemes. A recent Commission study recommends a five-point plan to promote employee share ownership. However, the implementation of such policies entails significant challenges, and there are risks for the employees involved. On behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I would therefore like to ask the following. How does the Commission intend to promote employee financial participation in the light of Parliament’s resolution? What lessons have been learned from the recent pilot project? My second question: how does the Commission intend to ensure compliance with the principles set out in the 1992 Council recommendation – i.e. no substitution of wages, no discrimination and no conflict with participation in decision-making? My third question: how does the Commission intend to promote best practice for employee ownership schemes? Fourth question: how does the Commission plan to ensure employee participation and the inclusion of workers’ representatives in the planning and implementation of such schemes? Fifth question: does the Commission intend to develop models of strategic ownership as regards employees’ shares in ESO schemes so as to serve the long-term interests of companies and their employees? Sixth and last question: what measures should be taken to protect employees’ savings invested in a company, in the event of a crisis or of the company becoming insolvent, so as to avoid the double risk of employees losing their job, income and savings at the same time? A comprehensive involvement of employees and their representatives requires proper information concerning the underlying risks of joining a participation scheme and also raises questions related to taxation and labour law. How can the Commission ensure that workers are not being used, that all employees obtain equal access, and that they never have to face the risk of financial ruin should the company concerned run into insolvency?", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 161, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, I would like to thank Ms Ulvskog and Parliament for initiating this debate. I see employee financial participation as part of a broader narrative of sustainable entrepreneurship in Europe which I want us to support and to encourage. It is a complex issue with wider implications.  Recent research suggests that companies with employee shareholders tend to create more jobs, pay more taxes and relocate less than those without. Employees owning shares could also increase the proportion of long-term oriented shareholders and provide a solution to some business succession problems.  A number of recent Commission proposals have aimed to address the weaknesses in corporate governance identified during the financial and economic crisis. The proposal for a shareholders’ rights directive is part of this agenda. I am convinced that we will find a sound compromise. This being said, currently less than one third of companies in the EU offer financial participation to their employees. It may also be an internal market issue as the divergence in national, legal and fiscal rules for such schemes could create barriers to cross-border plans.  The Commission committed in its 2012 Action Plan on company law and corporate governance to investigating potential obstacles to transnational employee share ownership schemes and to taking appropriate action to promote employee share ownership throughout Europe. The pilot project launched in September 2013, which consisted of a comprehensive study, and the conference held in January 2014 helped the Commission in analysing the existing obstacles. The Commission intends to make the comprehensive information gathered in the study widely available to all interested parties. Given the diversity in national approaches to employee financial participation across the EU and the resulting cross-border problems, the Commission encourages the exchange of best practices, be it between Member States but also between companies and employees. When reflecting on the way forward the Commission will also take duly into account Parliament’s resolution from January 2014, as well as contributions from stakeholders. We will also be guided by the principles set out in the 1992 Council Recommendation on employee financial participation.  Let me also stress one important aspect: financial participation should not be a substitute for the main income. Instead it should play a complimentary role and be paid in addition to a fixed wage. Such schemes should in principle be open to all employees and treat them without any discrimination, unless some differentiation is justified given the employees’ different needs or interests.  The Commission takes note of Parliament’s resolution, in particular as regards consultation of workers or their representatives on such schemes before their introduction. Social partners taking part in negotiations at company level, according to national practices and traditions, should be involved. Employees belonging to trade unions should not be discriminated against.  The 1992 Council Recommendation also underlined the need to take into account national collective bargaining legislation or practices when choosing between the schemes available. Negotiations on such schemes should not replace the normal negotiations on wage setting and working conditions.  The potential risks of financial participation also need to be addressed.

Mr President, this is an issue that has been on the European agenda for some time. The first 'Pepper report' was presented in 1991, almost 25 years ago. I was seven years old at the time. So I won't say I've been through that knowingly, but I can look back on what's happened over the last 25 years. If one thing is certain, it is that here in Europe, and certainly in the European Parliament, we are fully convinced of the potential added value of financial participation for workers. Employees feel more involved in the company, are more connected to the long-term prospects of the company and they are more motivated to commit to that company. At the same time, this is also reflected in the better results that companies achieve as a result. And that, as the Commissioner himself rightly said, leads to more jobs, more jobs. So that's all good. At the same time, we have seen that over the last 25 years, systems of financial participation of workers have developed in different ways and at different rates in different Member States. Certainly when it comes to tax and social legislation, there are many differences in Europe, and with the increase of the internal market, with the increase of companies operating across borders, we are also seeing an increase in the number of cross-border obstacles. I therefore welcome the European Commission's plan, the five-point plan, in particular with a view to raising awareness and providing better information, because we all want more financial participation in a good framework with adequate protection for workers, but we have there as a Europe, as you rightly said, , not everything to say about it. I think we should fully support your approach. I've got three more questions. 1) How can we prevent financial participation from being put in place in some cases by existing participation structures? 2) Does the development of financial participation correspond to the increasingly flexible labour market? And how do you see, for example, the participation of employees on temporary contracts? 3) As far as SMEs, small and medium-sized enterprises are concerned, how can we ensure that small businesses can participate in such systems in a good way without too much bureaucracy and at no too much cost?", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 163, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Jutta STEINRUCK", "mepid": "96831", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

This goes beyond the economic element: it is also about mutual appreciation, identification between companies and employees – this can also be strengthened by such models. It also serves a sustainable and long-term orientation of the company. In order to make these models better known across the EU, we need a stronger exchange of best practice examples. These examples include the sociedades laborales in Spain or the employee participation foundation of voestalpine AG, which is the only model in Europe with international voting rights bundling for individual share ownership. But in order to realize these benefits for both sides, clear ground rules are needed. This includes information and consultation of employee representatives, but also participation in decision-making bodies, early and comprehensive involvement of workers or their representatives in establishing such a model, the involvement of the social partners and a certain level of protection for workers from the double risk – on the one hand, losing capital in the context of participation and, on the other hand, the usual risk of losing their jobs. And, importantly, the European way of employee participation must not undermine national law. Commissioner, I would ask you to clarify how you intend to ensure that these basic rules are followed, especially in the case of cross-border models of financial employee participation.

Employee-owned businesses have played a leading role in delivering the UK’s economic recovery. 2014 saw the number of employee-owned businesses rise by some 9%. Some 30% of employees in the UK hold shares in their company. Sadly, in many other European countries, ownership has actually declined. In the UK, our flagship is the John Lewis partnership with some 82 000 employees or partners. Companies range from the very small to the very large and represent a wide range of sectors. Overall, they contribute some GBP 30 billion to the UK economy. In my own region, we have employee-owned companies ranging from a veterinary practice in rural Herefordshire to a world-leading manufacturer of machinery protection systems in Kidderminster, from the largest independent chartered insurance brokers based in Birmingham, to a family-owned food distributor in Willenhall that has been trading for nearly 100 years.  The thing they have in common as employee-owned businesses is higher productivity, greater innovation and better profitability. Employee owners also think and act for the long term, sometimes in marked contrast to the short-termism that can prevail. I want to pay tribute to the Employee Ownership Association which champions this business model so effectively.  So what is the EU’s role in this? As always, it is to create the environment where businesses can thrive and grow, by addressing skills shortages and by removing barriers, but above all by reducing administrative burdens on business, especially micros, and making it easier for businesses to compete in the global market place.

I really think that we have an obligation to look into all possibilities for supporting growth and job creation.  In this perspective one perhaps minor, but important, thing could be employee financial participation (EFP). EFP can strengthen small and medium-sized enterprises, offering mechanisms for innovative financing, as workers may wish to invest in shares in the company by which they are employed. Despite these possible benefits, the focus on EFP varies from Member State to Member State. This is the reason why I am participating in this very important debate today, because when it comes to employee share ownership and employee financial participation, the Commission and Parliament – as was mentioned by my colleague from the EPP Group earlier on – have been doing a lot of talking.

Giving workers the opportunity to participate in the business activity and its management means making people more aware, more responsible and more involved throughout the work process and allows entrepreneurs greater efficiency and productivity. I am not saying this out of hear or theories, but because I have been a consultant in small and medium-sized enterprises for years and this was precisely the approach that we have always used, a win-win approach where both entrepreneurs and workers who have to be part of a single team and fight to achieve the same goals must win. I can proudly say that all the companies that have followed this approach, small and medium-sized Italian companies, in past years, have been companies that saw their profits and turnover increase and saw the living conditions of their workers improve. So this is the actually correct approach and the approach that we have to follow. We have done a lot of work on investment in training and these companies have always developed much more than other investments in training. So the time has really come to ask the Commission for a truly executive approach and concrete actions in this regard.

However, on the subject we are discussing today, we must take into account some very serious issues, always with the aim of safeguarding workers' rights and protecting them from risks, as it is obvious that not every employee can have the knowledge of an investment adviser. Our aim is, in my opinion, to set some very basic rules. First of all, we must ensure that the participation of employees in the share capital of the company should under no circumstances be compulsory. Nor should the salary of workers or part of it be replaced with shares; employees, after being paid, can simply choose to buy shares in the company as a matter of priority.

I can already say that, in my view, employee participation makes a great deal of sense, in three respects: on the one hand, for employees, on the other, for employers, but also for companies. That is why it is good that we are dealing with this issue, even though I have been very surprised that this has been an issue for so many years and decades without any reasonable conclusion being reached. I would like to make two or three points as to why this is good for workers and for employers. It is clear to employees that it is a direct participation in companies and also in the success of companies, but it is also a stronger attachment of employees to their companies and thus a higher motivation. It is good for companies and employers because they can tie their most important capital, namely their employees, even more closely to their companies, and thus perhaps also improve their capital structure and, to a large extent, their creditworthiness. I would also say, however, that it is important to implement this instrument of employee participation only as a complementary element and by no means a mandatory element in Europe, for various reasons. I come from Germany. We have good structures in Germany, such as a company age group that is insolvency-proof and has been in place for a long time. With employee participation, we might have a double burden on many employees by having to pay into retirement provision once and perhaps also to employee participation. The second problem is that it is very easy to introduce public limited companies, but it could be very difficult in small and medium-sized enterprises. That is why I say that we must be careful not to require entrepreneurs to give up property rights without wanting to do so. To my conclusion, I would like to continue to work on this.

Firstly, it is essential for the Commission to improve access to information on these plans, which will have a useful impact on the European economy in proportion to their dissemination. In this sense, the transnational aspect cannot be underestimated in order to activate a truly European system that overcomes potential situations of double taxation or forms of restriction on the exercise of the economic freedoms guaranteed by the Treaties. The resolution adopted by the European Parliament in January 2014 underlines how these instruments can constitute a kind of shock absorber that distributes investment risk among the main shareholders of the companies, while also ensuring that employees have an equity portfolio of savings. It remains crucial to ensure that, on the one hand, these instruments do not replace traditional welfare measures, which are essential for maintaining European social protection standards, which have already been seriously challenged by the short-sighted application of these doctrines that we have seen in recent years concerning the consolidation of national budgets.

I will personally support any well-developed model based on voluntary grounds and strictly legally regulated employer-employee relationships. I believe that voluntary financial investment of workers in the company is a quality bond between employers and employees, because it creates a lasting relationship of financial interdependence. Workers would be motivated by such a regulated relationship through inclusion in the management process and financial rewards for good business, while employers would be more inclined to invest in the company longer term, primarily in the field of education and professional training. In addition to being based on voluntary basics, transparency and quality employee information, such a model should also be strictly legally defined.  I believe that the legal instability of certain Member States will be the main obstacle to the uniform application of this model at Union level. This is an additional reason why I think that the desire of this House to make decisions about the financial participation of employees at the company level is extremely positive.

The gap between workers and those with wealth continues to grow, and employee financial participation can help bridge that gap.

Listening to all the colleagues, it is clear that employee financial participation varies significantly from one Member State to another, with a glowing report from the UK. I agree with Ms McIntyre in that we need the Commission to create, first of all, an environment that is conducive to the take-up of these schemes, and secondly, the flourishing of these companies.

Will the euro collapse again, or the European Union? Secondly, when do we start to understand that the chance of winning is always a risk of loss?

Today, the profits of companies – especially multinational corporations – are increasing and the real wages of employees are decreasing. Mechanisms for the financial participation of employees in the company's profits, or the institution of employee ownership of the company, are important ways of solving this problem – properly implemented can help to solve the problem of dramatically increasing social inequalities, while at the same time strengthening the links of employees with their workplace. The study, co-authored by expert professor Lowitzsch on behalf of the European Commission, states that after 30 years of research into examples of employee financial participation, companies that are partly or wholly owned by employees generate more revenue, are more productive, generate more jobs and pay more taxes than their competitors without this kind of financial participation. At the macroeconomic level, these companies achieve a higher level of productivity, which also makes them more competitive and growing. At the regional level, they make companies owned by employees remain tied to their place of origin, more resistant to external or foreign takeovers of property.  Nevertheless, we must bear in mind that there are also significant risks involved. Firstly, it is necessary to be very careful when implementing these mechanisms in small and micro enterprises, as they can affect the competitiveness of these companies. The second risk is more related to employee ownership in investment projects. The recent crisis has shown very clearly that in the event of a collapse of the economy, workers may lose not only their place of employment, but also the savings placed in the company's shares. In the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we have come up with a question together with the European Commission, in which we stress that by promoting broadly understood financial participation of workers, we must also consider mechanisms to prevent them from losing their entire lives and ask how the Commission intends to promote a mechanism for employee financial participation and the exchange of best practices on the company's employee ownership, such as those in the UK, referred to by Anthea McIntyre.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 181, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Romana TOMC", "mepid": "125104", "text": "   Financial participation is one of the ways companies can encourage their employees to be more involved.

I am therefore looking with concern at the european Commission's proposals, which suggest the possibility of introducing a European regime for the financial participation of workers. Such proposals must be objectionable. Especially if they were to include micro, small and medium-sized family businesses. Actions to be voluntary should not be formalised. And certainly no bureaucratic and costly solutions should be created, such as promotion centres, expert groups, the adoption of new legislative standards. Such solutions are part of a culture of doing business, not legislation.  The domain of doing business is the ability to bear the risk of your own investments.

This not only strengthens social justice but also creates significant incentives to increase productivity and boost employment in business itself. But why don't we see this happening in Europe? Because the shareholders of the companies want the profits to be distributed exclusively to them. Take for example what happened to the profit distribution of CAC 40 companies here in France: 50 billion will be shared from profits. Fourthly, the matter must be dealt with at Member State level.

I would perhaps like to mention in my brief reflection one point of view that we have not discussed here, and that is the point of view of a consumer who is entitled to quality services. This greets visitors to the gallery.  Now, maybe what we're talking about here, I'm going to zoom in on a little practice. Even as a consumer myself, as a person who goes to the store, sometimes when I come across a saleswoman who is unhelpful, unwilling, slow, who lets me know that I'm harassing her, I wonder what she actually gets out of it to make the store prosper. And I'm thinking that it would be good if people in the service were motivated financially to leave me as a customer feeling that they respected me there, and that's why they served me well. So that's what we're talking about here today, ladies and gentlemen.  I would like to respond by saying that the Commission has as its great objective growth and employment, prosperity and stability of the business environment, as has been said here. At the same time, improving the conditions for doing business and not burdening you with additional bureaucratic burdens. These are all objectives and, at the same time, pitfalls that we must address in the Commission with clever and well-targeted legislative proposals. And that's among other activities I'm not going to mention here. In any case, today's debate showed me that we mostly understand the greater participation of employees in corporate governance and information and in codecision and increasing the ownership of companies as beneficial for business. That we don't actually see this in the first plan as a social aspect and a social improvement in the lives of employees, but it's just good and demonstrably good for the results of those companies. This is demonstrated by both the long-term debates and parliament's previous resolutions, and this is demonstrated by the study that the Commission is now working with, which we received on 28 October last year. This study proposes some specific measures that I will follow in preparing a possible legislative proposal, which, as you know, cannot come this year because it is not in this year's work plan. However, we will be considering a reflection on the draft legislation for 2016, which, however, and I can probably guarantee you today, will rather be a voluntary instrument. I do not think that we can come up with something from the position of the European Union that we will order someone to do, because there are indeed big differences between member states in the business culture, as has been said here, in the ability of employees to understand the investment activities of companies, and in some countries there is a need to increase their awareness. There's also an interesting passage about that in the study I had the opportunity to read. This means that it will be legislation of a softer nature, i.e. voluntary and rather a recommendation that will refer to examples of good practice.  Mrs Bilbao Barandic said here that she sees this as a recommendation for a good and successful corporate governance model. I see it very similarly because I also came from a business environment, I ran a company and I also worked in the private sphere for a long time. I think that in the search for a good model for corporate governance, we must always be treated and directed towards appropriately distributed responsibilities and risks. And these are all things that we have to deal with if we want to offer a good model to follow, one that can be used in all Member States despite the big differences.  We have a big task ahead of us, but I can only agree with those who have said that strengthening the motivation of employees by being financially involved is positive for the economy. I am not going to quote here from what the study recommends, but very briefly: it is, for example, the establishment of a virtual online hub, an online tool to inform about these good models, it is the establishment of an expert group, it is actually the creation of that action plan that some of you have been calling for here. I'm not saying at the moment that we're going to follow those recommendations to the point, but we're going to be very inspired by them and we're going to consider them very seriously. Thank you for the offer of the Basque model and project, I will be very happy to look into it.

And, as Shakespeare said, everything's fine, if it ends well. In 2008, under the French Presidency, we were able to implement the first proposal, which precisely envolved this decision to end impunity, to reduce discrimination between offenders in the field of cross-border road safety. It is therefore an essentially European, cross-border dossier, which also aims to improve road safety, reduce road casualties and the injured. But it is true that, in 2008, we launched a comprehensive, bold procedure, which was actually based on information and the support of victims' family associations, important and European bodies such as the ETSC, or European associations of traffic authorities, such as Tispol. And we were therefore able to carry out that formula, that procedure, so that cross-border offenders would first be informed of their infringement, after returning home, and could be fined to end that impunity. But, as so often, the Commission and Parliament were not accompanied by the Council. The Council blocked, out of various fears, the procedure and we were not able, until 2011, to resume it. And here I must pay tribute to the Belgian Presidency which, with its creativity and its tenacity and courage, was able to resurrect this dossier with a true legal basis: the legal basis for police cooperation. But it was the way to be able to put on the rails a process and a procedure so important to end impunity in the field of trafficking. And it was the Belgian Presidency, together with the Hungarian, who again relaunched the procedure; on another legal basis it is true, although we were able to improve some aspects. We lost, for example, the presence of important Member States, such as Ireland, the United Kingdom or Denmark, but instead we could expand the list of assumptions and improved some of the proposals for such police cooperation. So by November 2013, we already had an instrument that should have been transposed by all Member States. And, at that time, shortly the after, in May 2014, the Court warned us of something that we had already been anticipating, but which we had not been able to ignore, which was that the initial legal basis, which had been provided for by the Commission and supported by Parliament, was the basis of road safety. This was obviously an obstacle, in the sense that the Member States were already implementing and successfully implementing the Information Exchange Directive, but the Court's decision had to be taken into question, as we have always done. I have to say that the Court was particularly clever in giving us the possibility of having a few months to put the text back on track. This was done by the Commission, to which I am very grateful, and again Parliament and I have to say that in this case we went and have been especially generous; and I look at it because I will then want to ask the Commissioner for something in return for parliament's generosity. Parliament did not want to reopen the whole dossier this time, to redo the Directive, which we did not like 100 percent, since the procedure is only an information procedure, but does not include the sanction.  That is why I ask you and ask you, Commissioner, to set in motion as soon as possible to make the evaluation report and, above all, to be courageous and to make us new proposals to close and complete the procedure. I think we owe it to the families of the victims of trafficking. We owe it to all European citizens who, through instruments like these, have to be able to believe that Europe really protects them, and protects them from something as important as the loss of life in traffic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 200, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Violeta Bulc", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I would like on behalf of the Commission to thank the Members of Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Ms Ayala Sender, for the quick examination of this proposal and the finalisation of the report within the deadline set by the Court. This is a perfect example of how good cooperation between our institutions can bring tangible results very quickly and efficiently.  The Commission is very grateful that we managed to address the issue on which the Court ruled last year, while staying true to the principles of the original directive. The new directive will now be implemented according to the transport legal basis in the Treaty and applied across all 28 Member States – and not only to the 25 as before, which excluded the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark. The adoption of this proposal will ensure legal continuity and will contribute to improving road safety, which is one of the essential objectives of European transport policy. Too many Europeans are still victims of reckless drivers who do not respect traffic rules. By making it possible to easily identify drivers from other Member States who commit traffic offences, the new directive is expected to have a positive impact on the behaviour of many motorists. EU citizens will realise now more than ever that road safety does not stop at national borders: it is a Europe-wide concern. As soon as one of the traffic offences listed in the directive is committed, the respective enforcement agent will be able to identify the owner of the car and ask him or her to justify him/herself.

There is no doubt that road safety is an absolute priority for the European institutions. Only through joint and cross-border efforts will we be able to halve the number of road deaths by 2020. This measure is a further step towards greater road safety, in addition to better training, infrastructure measures and a better safety system inside and outside vehicles. It is very important that this directive must now apply in all 28 Member States, including the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark. At present, 20 countries have already transposed the provisions into national law. I am confident that the remaining Member States will make every effort to meet the transposition deadline. However, it is also important, as has already been mentioned, for all drivers to be equal. Whether local or foreign drivers, everyone will have to follow the rules in the future. Traffic offences such as excessive speed, alcohol at the wheel and so on are equally dangerous matters everywhere. Another important consequence of the new legal basis is the adaptation of data protection rules. Here we have paid particular attention to this exchange of information. The issue of road safety affects us all and requires sustained efforts, especially as the number of road casualties has unfortunately risen slightly in some countries over the past year. I am very confident, as does Mrs Ayala Sender, that the Commission will fulfil its commitment in November 2016 and present this progress report.

Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I think it is a step that is now moving in the right direction. We have now at least been able to answer the question of whether those who commit traffic offences abroad, which actually become conspicuous, can be prosecuted. I believe that, in the overall structure of the 28 Member States, this is not so easy to achieve. However, we must not forget that we must continue along this road. If we finally look at the results of the Vision Zero strategy, we see that, fortunately, the number of road deaths has continued to fall in recent years. This directive can only be part of the overall strategy. Why am I saying this? Of course, we now have a situation where, if you become conspicuous in an EU Member State, you can be contacted directly. But the question arises: what happens after that? I think that is what interests the citizens. At the moment, the end result is that enforcement – that is, that the fine is actually collected – is not the case. We therefore always proceed from the case where the person who committed the traffic offence ultimately refuses to pay the fine. In this case – and I am deliberately saying this because I know that you will have to carry out an evaluation in 2016 – these are precisely the points that must then be included in the European Commission's next legislative proposal. Because I believe that it is only really complete when the rowdy on the street knows that he is not going to get around to paying this fine. At the moment it is a good start.

I didn't think that was a textbook example of addressing an urgent, societal problem. But I now hope that the re-adoption of this proposal will achieve the real objective of the directive, which is to promote road safety in Europe. Traffic offences can now be more easily enforced across borders, especially those that are most common and cause the most damage. And then it's about speeding, driving through red lights, and behind the wheel with alcohol or drugs. It is also important that road users know where they stand, and I therefore hope, Mr President, that Article 8 of the directive will not turn out to be a wash.

Madam President, Commissioner, the World Health Organization recalls in its studies that road accidents are the seventh leading cause of death in the world and that they will be fifth in 2030 if the most successful measures to date are not insisted on in order to reduce accidents. Campaigning to prevent speeding, encourage seat belt or helmet use, prevent drug or alcohol use, prevent distractions, and boost respect for road signs reduce the number of accidents and their severity. And the sanction of infringements relating to these issues, too. The Directive we are discussing today aims to improve cooperation and data exchange between Member States in order to improve road safety in Europe. The change in legal basis will also allow Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland to incorporate this Directive into their legislation. Its objective: to allow a smooth exchange between the competent authorities in the control of traffic of vehicle registration data throughout Europe and to identify and adequately punish all offenders, regardless of the Member State in which the basic safety rules, such as those cited at the outset, have been breached. I also hope that it will stimulate cooperation within the Member States where competences in this area are decentralised. The Directive should help to reduce accidents uniformly across Europe. Because Europe is the region of the world with the least deaths per million inhabitants due to traffic accidents. However, the distribution of victims and accidents has large differences between the different Member States. We must ensure that control of the most dangerous infringements is definitely possible throughout the European Union. In addition, we will encourage countries with the most accidents to take action on infrastructure, vehicle parks and other factors which are also paramount to avoiding a drama that in the Union involves the deaths of 55 people each million Europeans each year.

Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Yes, the regulations need to be updated. As it is today, it works very badly on the roads. I see, not least in heavy commercial traffic, how cars from other countries easily escape the police's issued fines by simply throwing the note out the window. There is no system to raise this money, not that works at least.  It is important that we do something. There are several things in the report that I think are a good thing. Weight controls, for example, are great for drivers, because it is always the driver who sits with the responsibility the day you are stopped by the police. Traffic controls, proportionate to traffic, i also think are a good incentive. We also need to strengthen the heavy group of police who are in charge of the checks.  One thing that is very important in this, I think, is that the fine should be paid on the spot as far as possible. Otherwise, I think it's just too easy to get away from this. It is no problem for, for example, a haulage company engaged in commercial traffic to ensure that the driver, for example, has a credit card, a credit card, with him and can pay the fine. Otherwise, the legislation will have no impact on this. It's very important.  At the same time, I am also pleased that we can access the fake driving licences, which have become an increasing problem, where today you buy a driving licence over the internet and then get into a heavy truck and engage in professional traffic.

As Mr Van Dalen said, 25 000 road deaths a year in Europe is a terrible number and we must reduce that as much as possible and as quickly as possible. That is why we, as an EPP Group, think it is a good thing that we can conclude this dossier here for the time being with a clear approach and a clear implementation. It is fair to say that, of course, we have all been screwed in on cross-border traffic offences. And then you always thought \"we'll get away with that\" but that'll be over now. Yes, we, as motorcyclists, have to swallow for a while, but road safety comes first, of course. The history of the proposal has been the least necessary. It has taken an unnecessarily long time with an unnecessary amount of legal seism between the institutions. A few more questions. First of all, it's now about eight traffic violations. It is indeed the most important eight. But what are we going to do with the other traffic violations? For example, the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium are currently exchanging more data on traffic violations. Now first the question of implementation, and then the question of enforcement. Mr Eickhout asked about it. Are the computer systems in different countries in order? We have adopted more measures here that later went wrong because of the computer systems.

Now make no mistake, this is a road safety measure. It is about deterrence and it is about good governance; it is not about burdensome or unfair regulation. All the offences considered are serious offences. In particular, speed we know is a primary factor in up to a third – if not more – of fatal collisions in the EU, and is an aggravating factor in most other collisions. So this is something that we really need to get a grip on. In my country, I know that this has not been universally welcomed and in many cases we have been urged to try to stay out of this. I am calling on the government today to change its view and to try and implement this more quickly than it has said it can. Just on the figures, there are some very extreme examples both ways of how this has worked out. On a London ring road, people going twice the speed limit in foreign-registered vehicles are not being caught; similarly if you look at the French figures, 500 000 people in UK-registered cars are getting away with speeding offences every single year. So this is something which works both ways. It works for the benefit of all across the EU and it also underlines the need to do more on road safety in general in order to meet our road safety targets, which we are going to be at a push to meet by 2020 – in particular, making sure that conditionality on road safety is a point on all major transport infrastructure projects in line with the Trans-European Network guidelines.

Freedom of movement within the European Union is one of the most important achievements of integration on our continent. However, the privileges of travelling on European roads should undoubtedly also entail responsibility for the offences committed. Member States should have the tools to effectively enforce the penalties imposed for traffic offences. To refrain from imposing a penalty on the basis of the technical inability to identify the address of the offender would be a clear violation of the principle of equality for all citizens of the European Union, but above all a disgrace nowadays.  In Poland, where the number of road accidents is one of the highest in Europe and where they very often result in the deaths of victims, the final harmonisation of these provisions is particularly welcome. In my country, accidents and road collisions caused by foreigners account for about 3% of all accidents and collisions on the roads, the vast majority of which are caused by citizens of the European Union. With the second most important fatality rate in the European Union, any such incident is extremely important and the possibility of effectively imposing a penalty on the offender plays an important preventive role.  It is also worth appreciating that the Countries of the Community – Denmark, the United Kingdom and Ireland, which until now have remained outside this system – have agreed to join it after a transitional period.

This demonstrates that this legislation simply is not plausible.

The need for EU expenditure to standardise cross-border technologies to implement this legislation is beyond belief. The language barriers between States that allow the system to operate effectively are unpractical and unsafe. The realities of this report pose more problems than solutions. Robert Goodwill, the British Road Minister, has stated that cross-border information exchanges on penalty points are inappropriate. It will be interesting to see if his party’s MEPs will agree that this is a matter better dealt with by individual Member States.

This report is of great importance for improving road safety, to which we have been overwhelmingly committed. Far too many people are still dying in accidents caused by crime on European roads, and far too many are seriously injured. We are all too familiar with road traffic offences, which are mainly responsible for fatal accidents. It is the significant speeding, drunken driving or driving under the influence of drugs, not wearing a seatbelt and driving over a red light. It is precisely these traffic offences that are at stake today. They must be punished, regardless of the Member State in which they are committed and in which Member State the vehicle with which these offences are committed is registered. Serious road traffic offences must simply not go unpunished in an internal market. An electronic data exchange network, which complies with the strict European data protection rules, will be created. This allows for reciprocal access to vehicle registration data – a prerequisite for facilitating or speeding up the investigation of an offence and enabling it to be punished. Now that the legal basis has been adapted in line with the ECJ ruling of May 2014, I am reassured.

Today's proposal is a new step towards European integration because it facilitates the cross-border exchange of information on road safety infringements, such as speeding or drink-driving, and puts an end to the anonymity of non-resident drivers. It also ensures that road traffic offences do not go unpunished and shows that all drivers in the European Union have the same rights and duties. Road safety can only be achieved if the rules are certain and are respected by everyone. In fact, the person who receives the road infringement notification is treated equally, because now all European citizens, regardless of the vehicle's number plate, are subject to the same legal consequence as the infringement. We must also bear in the view that each Member State is a destination for tourists from other Eu ropean Union countries and, consequently, the possibility of exchanging information with other States improves not only safety but also consumer rights. The era of impunity is therefore over, and yet I believe that a further step forward could be to allow not only the exchange of information but, indeed, the possibility of applying the sanction directly. A revision of the directive would therefore also be desirable in this respect.

In fact, it is the European Court of Justice that has you putting this directive back on the job: it was adopted on an erroneous legal basis. However, it retains the same motives. If it is a question of prosecuting the most serious offences, of course, it can only be agreed with, but I note that, among those offences, one has classified, for example, the failure to fasten a seat belt. This is certainly likely to jeopardize the safety of the driver, who is negligent but does not endanger the lives of others. There are many other serious offences that are not covered by this directive. Therefore, nothing changes with respect to the criticisms we were making four years ago on this issue.

The problem of impunity for foreign drivers has long been raised internationally, both by ministers and the media, and above all by ordinary citizens who are dissatisfied with this injustice.

Last year alone, more than 20 000 people died on the roads of the European Union. Unfortunately, we must remember that even the best preventive solutions in the field of road safety prove to be ineffective when there is a sense of impunity among road users. It happens that during a single journey, in one day the driver is able to break a dozen traffic regulations on the territory of several Member States, and its discovery depends precisely on the bilateral exchange of information between the selected services of the country concerned.

The directive has already shown its potential. Since its entry into force in November 2013, the number of infringements by foreign drivers, now aware that any infringement committed abroad can be notified to them thanks to this new mechanism, has in fact decreased. However, there is a need for legal certainty and it is therefore essential, all the more so when we consider that, despite the fact that the European Union is on track to achieve the target of a 50% reduction in road fatalities by 2020, the economic crisis has led to an increase in the number of road accident victims due to the ageing of the car fleet and radical cuts in infrastructure maintenance costs.

It shows me that we are together in this ambitious plan for road safety. I can only confirm that for all of us every traffic victim is one too many. Let me reply now to some of the concerns expressed during this debate. First of all, very briefly, personal data is processed very carefully and the Member States can only consult the other national database and use the data for the relevant procedures. So fundamental privacy rights are fully guaranteed. Now let me refer to your concern – which I share, of course; this is just the first step and the real work still lies ahead of us – and say that the Commission will now concentrate on implementation. It will prepare a report to Parliament and the Council assessing the application of the Directive and its contribution to road safety. That will happen by 2016.  This assessment will be an opportunity to look further, as some of you invited us to do. For instance, we will see if there is a need to develop common standards for automatic checking equipment, road safety guidelines, adding additional offences, harmonising traffic rules or even the criteria for a follow-up procedure in the case of non-payment of fines. We know that this is a serious issue.  But first we need to see what the current approach will bring. Perhaps it will show that this is a sufficient deterrent and people will change their driving behaviour. If not, I can assure you that the Commission will not hesitate to propose additional measures, as just outlined. Twenty-two Member States have transposed the Directive into national law. There are six more to go. We will work very closely with them to proceed with the necessary steps.  Finally, allow me just to thank you very much once again for the really good cooperation.

It has been seven intense years of relentless cooperation between those of us who are engaged in road safety, tenacious and tireless people who know that, in road safety, if efforts are no longer made one day, it goes back very quickly. As some of you have said, there is already an uptick in casualties and injuries in some Member States. The reasons? The crisis has aged the fleet, the infrastructures – we also age – there are more vans, more urban victims, pedestrians, cyclists, bikers, but good... If, as we have done, we continue to insist on the goal not only of halving the victims by 2020, and of reducing the wounded as well, but on the goal of reaching even zero, we will surely win. Only with the implementation of this Directive do ETSC experts tell us that we will prevent 350 to 400 deaths per year on our roads. Can you imagine that? We're talking about the equivalent of an entire plane a year, plus the thousands of wounded. That alone is worth it. Don't these potential victims, their families, the traffic authorities, deserve it when they have to care for wounded and victims without being able to avoid the accident? If, as you tell us, Commissioner - and I thank you very much – the 2016 report is well accompanied by proposals to complete the current procedure, and if you were added to this, in addition to the revision of the Infrastructure Security Directive, plus the proposals you have just made to us, this legislature would, of course, mark a significant change in what matters most to us : that European citizens can continue to move on our roads feeling protected and safe.

As you know, the European Union has been a strong and consistent partner to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) over the last 15 years. In 2006 it provided the bulk of financing for the organisation of the first democratic elections in the history of Congo and the DRC has been one of our top priorities in Africa over the past decades. This includes two military operations and a sustained effort to support security sector reform with two CSDP missions, as well as more traditional areas of cooperation such as health, roads and natural resources management. Today I think that many of you are especially concerned about the delays and uncertainties surrounding the electoral process, which includes the holding of local elections in 2015 and the legislative and presidential elections in 2016 at the latest. The recent debate over the passing of a new electoral law has led to violent popular protests calling for constitutional timelines to be respected, and to two casualties. During this difficult time we called on all political forces to seek a consensus to facilitate an appeasement of the situation, and we asked the government in particular to exercise constraint, to maintain an open political space and allow for the peaceful expression of opinion. The prerequisite of organising a general consensus before the legislative and presidential elections has now been dropped. This opens the door to organising the elections within the constitutional timeframe. This is a very positive step which I welcome and I know too that some of you expressed opinions on the same lines.  But respect for the constitution goes further than respecting timelines. Freedoms of speech and of the media, the right of peaceful assembly, respect for the rights of the opposition are all essential components of a democracy. These critical elements will be part of our dialogue with the Congolese Government, with the objective of reducing tensions in the political climate.  I am very much aware of, and I share, the concerns of this Parliament regarding the situation of Dr Denis Mukwege and the Panzi Hospital. Let me say too that I was honoured, personally, to sit in this very same room, listening to his inspiring and dramatic words last November on the occasion of the Sakharov Prize. I was also honoured to have on that occasion a very good meeting with him, looking for ways of cooperating on concrete projects. I wish to confirm to you that the European Union is following with great vigilance the situation concerning his physical security as a human rights defender.  I have also asked my representative in Kinshasa to enquire about the dispute between the Congolese administration and the Panzi Hospital. I strongly support an amicable agreement between the Panzi Hospital and the Congolese administration.  The holding of democratic elections leading to a peaceful transition of power will be key to longer-term stability in the DRC and in the wider region. Stability will also depend on other factors, in particular the neutralisation of all armed groups in Eastern Congo. There has been some significant progress in this respect thanks to the efforts of the Congolese army and MONUSCO.  Nevertheless, important challenges remain: for example regarding the ex-M23 movement. The governments of the DRC, Uganda and Rwanda should strengthen their collaboration to achieve a durable disarmament, demobilisation and reintegration of ex-combatants and their dependents.  The FDLR rebel group remains a major threat to long-term stability in the region. Linked with the Rwanda 1994 genocide ideology, this group has inflicted immense human suffering and has spoiled DRC–Rwanda relations. With the support of the United Nations, there is now a unique opportunity to address one of the root causes of conflicts in the Kivus. The FDLR movement has been given plenty of time by countries in the region to surrender peacefully. We discussed this in the Foreign Affairs Council in January and we adopted 28 Council conclusions where we stated that the time has now come for military operations. However we stress too that we invite MONUSCO and FARDC to ensure civilians are fully protected and that international humanitarian law is respected during the operations. Let me reiterate our support for the UN involvement in promoting peace and stability. This includes the sustained efforts of MONUSCO and troop-contributing countries as well as the personal efforts of the UN Special Envoy for the Great Lakes region.  Let me also stress that I know, and I share, your desire to curb the links between conflict and exploitation of natural resources in the Great Lakes region. As part of its comprehensive approach the European Union has started to address the situation. Together with the Commission, as you might very well know, my predecessor issued a Joint Communication on responsible sourcing of conflict minerals. And Parliament and the Council are currently examining right now the draft regulations that went together with this Communication. Finally, I would like to mention the European Union’s long-term commitment in the DRC to supporting the preservation of Congolese national parks. This includes Virunga Park, which is part of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The future of this park is threatened by permits being granted for oil exploration that could lead to oil exploitation in the future.

Madam High Representative, you have listed some problems, such as the problem of exploitation of minerals, illegal financing of armed groups, the problem of systematic rape of women – as evidenced here in this House by Dr. Mukwege, as of course is the problem of selective justice by which Dr. Mukwega's hospital was closed after he sent critical tones to the authorities. But the causes of all these problems can be found indeed in ineffifiable institutions, in undemocratic institutions, in the absence of the rule of law, in high rates of corruption. Protesters in Kinshasa rose mainly because an election law change was announced that would then order a census in the country before the next elections are called. And it was quite clear that this announced electoral reform was an attempt to perpetuaating incumbent President Kabila's authority.  That is why the affirmation and processes of democratization in the country are extremely important, and of course the refooulation and our policies of development cooperation so that they can potentiate the construction of inclusive democratic institutions. In this regard, I think that additional efforts are needed both from the aspect of development policy and the overall foreign policy of the European Union, and this should be one of the main messages from this debate.  Finally, I would also like to add that although we have today the authoritarian authority of President Kabila, before him his father, before that Mobutu, remains the same paradigm of corruption that is the very source of these problems.

Vedo dalla lista degli interventi per questo pomeriggio, per uno dei punti di discussione successivi, cioè la situazione in Ucraina per l'appunto, che l'on. Buonanno non è iscritto a parlare. Lo invito, se forse vuole parlare della situazione in Ucraina, a venire in quest'Aula tra qualche ora e a discutere in quella sede. Io sarò qui, non so se lui ci sarà. Many of you mentioned things that I mentioned in my opening remarks and that I would like to underline. Thank you for joining our voices in this respect. I think this is a powerful message from this Parliament, and from the European institutions united, and I hope that this message gets to where it has to go.  Some of you mentioned the fact that this is not only important for the country itself, but it is also important for the region. I would also add that it is important for global security and stability, and that I will never ever accept the idea that one has to concentrate solely on crises and human rights violations and conflicts that are close to our borders, because also what happens in places that are apparently far away from us influences our security and our global stability. We have to deal with that, as it is not only our specific responsibility but also in our interest, and I think we should all understand that in this room.  Let me underline one point that was mentioned by many of you and something that Dr Mukwege reminded us of, which is the role of women in this. The victims are always women, girls – younger and younger every time, in every conflict – and children. Let me also mention the fact that there is a specific target. It is not by chance that it is always women who are the first victims or the first weapon in some conflicts. I can assure you that we are not only already working on this aspect in a specific way, in this particular case in the DRC, with support to the victims whether it be medical or legal, on the reform of the security system, and on the reform of the judiciary – because we also have to face that side of the attack against women – but we are going to work more and more on the first victims of conflict and violence who, everywhere in the world, are women and children. Let me also re-underline the need to be coherent. I thank those of you that raised this when you awarded the Sakharov Prize in this room only a few months ago. This implied that our support is not only to the person, but also to the work, mainly to the work of this person. I share these views, and I think that now today we need to guarantee protection to the person and to their work, and to collective work which is also a sign of hope for the country and for the region.  On Louis Michel’s proposal, let me say that I fully sympathise with this and I will make sure that once I go back to Brussels I will study it with our EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Stavros Lambrinidis, to see in what ways we can support it. Let me also say that I fully support the desire to curb the links between conflict and exploitation of natural resources. I know that the Council is examining the draft resolution that was presented with the communication by the Commission, and you have my personal commitment on that. I cannot guarantee that it will be enough, but I can guarantee that you have my personal commitment on it. Per finire fatemi usare l'italiano.

Let me underline that the European Union commends the important work of the Agency in delivering basic services to some five million Palestinian refugees across five fields of operation. I am particularly impressed by how the Agency has been performing under increasingly difficult circumstances, in particular in Gaza during and after the recent war, as well as in Syria with severe consequences in Lebanon and Jordan.  Allow me to recall that, along with its Member States, the European Union remains the largest and most predictable donor to the Agency. In combination with contributions from EU Member States, the overall contribution in 2014 accounted for 34% of the total support to UNRWA. Let me also stress that the European Union has always been very quick in paying the support allocated immediately after signature of the contract.  Since 2000 the European Union has provided over EUR 1.6 billion to the Agency. The aim of our support to the Agency’s regular budget is to sustain the delivery of essential public services to the refugees. Under the European Neighbourhood Instrument, the European Union has made a political commitment to make EUR 246 million available for UNRWA’s general fund for the period 2014-2016 through a joint multiannual framework. With an average allocation of EUR 82 million per year, this represents an increase of EUR 6 million compared to previous years. In view of the exceptional situation in Gaza, the European Union has acted swiftly and allocated an additional EUR 30 million to the Agency at the end of last year. This is in line with Parliament’s resolution of 18 September 2014 and with the EU’s pledge at the Cairo Conference on Gaza reconstruction in October 2014.  This additional allocation has allowed the Agency: firstly, to support children returning to school after the conflict and to provide basic food to over 800 000 refugees – EUR 7 million from the European Neighbourhood Instrument has been provided for that; secondly, to set up an emergency employment scheme, a job creation programme – EUR 5 million under the Instrument contributing to Stability and Peace; and, thirdly, to provide humanitarian assistance to help with emergency shelter – EUR 1 million by DG ECHO.  This EUR 13 million in additional funding from the European Union’s budget is a direct consequence of the Protective Edge Operation in Gaza, carried out in Gaza in July and August 2014. The Commission strongly regrets that the Agency has had to suspend its cash assistance programme in Gaza, which benefited tens of thousands of people by allowing them to repair their damaged and destroyed homes and provided rental subsidies for the homeless. In this regard, we hope that the EU funds planned in the pipeline will help palliate the financial situation of the general fund.  The European Union strongly calls on all donors to fulfil the pledges announced at the Cairo Conference on Gaza reconstruction in order to meet the immediate needs of the most vulnerable households in Gaza.  Finally, allow me to stress that the European Union also invites the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East to further increase its efforts to mobilise additional funds from non-traditional donors, including the Gulf countries, and to ensure the appropriate visibility of the European Union as by far the largest and most predictable donor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 265, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Mariya GABRIEL", "mepid": "96848", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group. Mr President, Commissioner, this is not the first time the agency has faced such a situation. It is therefore important to ask the right questions, and above all to ensure that all actors take responsibility.  First, the agency should clearly identify the reasons why the promised funds were ultimately not mobilized. Beyond the budgetary constraints faced by many donors, what are the real roots of this situation? Second, it becomes necessary to diversify the sources of contributions. The Palestinian conflict goes beyond regional issues and requires a comprehensive response. It is necessary - and we agree with you - to involve more donors, including from emerging countries. The third point is that humanitarianism must not become hostage to the political situation. UNRWA not only provides material assistance, but also provides a guarantee of human development for years to come, guaranteeing access to educational services and microfinance. It should always be kept in mind.  This brings me to my fourth point. The Palestinian Authority must plan for the development of the Palestinian territories beyond the humanitarian emergency. We need a medium- and long-term action plan, which is not just about rebuilding what has been destroyed while waiting for the next crisis. With regard to the European Union, through your voices, Commissioner and High Representative, the European Union has begun to strengthen its contribution to conflict resolution and crisis prevention, taking a regional and comprehensive perspective. You have our support to continue in this direction. Finally, the international community needs to think more broadly about the solutions we bring to refugees. Leaving the conflicts unresolved - between Israel and Palestine, in Syria, perhaps soon in Libya - leads to an unprecedented increase in the number of refugees. UNRWA must remain one of a kind, and we must not again accept \"temporary\" conditions for the next 65 years.

Mr President! I do not want to repeat what has been said last time, but just agree that we must all be aware that the situation in Gaza is worse than it has ever been, and at the same time that the refugees in Syria, the Palestinian refugees in Syria, are now under such pressure that they are forced to flee if they do not get real help now. It will be a burden on all of us. That is why, Madam President, make better promises to us about how the dramatic hole in the UNRDA's coffers can be closed so that they can continue the admirable work, because it is admirable, as almost everyone in here has indicated. In addition, we must also state that we will soon be able to hear that the EU's words matter. As recently as November last year, the Foreign Ministers assured us that they would take responsibility for keeping the desire for a two-state solution alive. And yet, when new settlements were again announced, it was just to the usual lament: \"We're sorry!,\" \"We're alarmed!,\" \"We're distancing ourselves from...!,\" \"We're shocked! They can just be allowed to continue. So something must now be done if the dream of a two-state solution is not to end up as a nightmare or simply disappear like a mirage. Let me conclude by simply demanding that the Palestinians do their own job. I am fully aware that Hamas is not helpful in this regard and that they should be criticised on sundays and together; but the Palestinians in Ramallah must also deliver. They are completely absent in Gaza and in the work of reconciliation, which has also therefore come to a complete standstill.

In the last weeks, we have seen the shelling of residential areas in Mariupol, increasing attacks on civilians, and a clear escalation on the ground, in many different parts of eastern Ukraine.  What is at stake first of all, I would like to remind us all, are thousands of human lives, almost two million refugees and internally displaced people, the integrity and sovereignty of an independent state on European territory, and respect for basic principles of international law: the first basic principle being that you do not change borders by force.  What is also at stake, especially in these very same hours where we see the escalation constantly growing in a very dangerous way, is also – and mainly, I would say – our capacity to respond to these threats, not only in an effective way to protect international law, states and the lives of civilians, but also our capacity to restore and preserve peace in Europe.  In these weeks, we have worked constantly; not always in a visible way but always in a very united, coordinated way and one, I would say, that is starting to be effective. Just after the shelling in Mariupol we took a coordinated approach, first of all with Mr Juncker and with Mr Tusk, to make sure that all the EU institutions were reacting on the same lines and with one voice, and with the 28 different Member States starting with the Latvian Presidency.  We held an extraordinary Foreign Affairs Council meeting just a few days after the shelling of Mariupol, where we decided all together – here I understand I should sit on the other side of the room but you will forgive me – to increase our pressure on Russia and on the separatists, by extending the time framework of the existing list of individuals and entities to September, and by adding names. We also tasked the Commission and EEAS services to prepare additional options for our pressure.  But we have also decided all together, keeping our unity in difficult times – and this is the first thing we must always do, keep our unity in difficult times, because this is our main strength – we also agreed to increase our diplomatic and political efforts and our diplomatic and political activity.  In this respect we have worked, as we had also done in previous months, through two channels that have proved to be – I cannot say effective because we did not reach a result, but the most effective among those that we have tried: on the one side the Trilateral Contact Group of the OSCE, and on the other side the so-called Normandy format, to relaunch the direct contacts between Kiev and Moscow that had been interrupted for a while and to find effective ways finally to start implementing the Minsk Agreements.  Because at that time it was clear not only that implementation of the points of the Minsk Agreements was not ongoing, but also that there was a risk of completely losing any kind of reference to the only agreement that had been signed by the different parties.  In this last week, as you know, we have again had initiatives on different levels – the OSCE channel, the Normandy format channel and the constant direct contacts that I personally have had both with President Poroshenko and Foreign Minister Klimkin – and with Foreign Minister Lavrov in Munich some days ago – to support all these ongoing efforts.  Yesterday we had another Foreign Affairs Council meeting where we decided together to endorse these efforts and create a space for the negotiations that are going on at present in Minsk; to allow the possibility of a successful result in these negotiations tomorrow night in Minsk with the meeting of the Normandy format.  Tomorrow is a chance – not a certainty, but a chance – that cannot be missed for all the reasons that I stated at the beginning of my speech, for the people who are losing their lives, for the principles of international law, for the sovereignty of the state and for preserving and restoring peace in Europe.  A chance I would say, if this would not lead to a much broader discussion about our kind of world and our kind of order or disorder, to preserve some sort of global balance, global order in our times. This is what is really at stake. I do not say I hope, but I am working at this time to make sure that the whole European Union – not only some Member States, but the whole European Union – backing these efforts, supporting these efforts, as I say sometimes quietly but always constantly and united, gets a result of some kind.  There is another part of the story while we are talking about Ukraine. It is the fact that, in times of crisis and conflict on Ukraine’s territory, it is extremely hard and difficult to carry out reforms and the internal Ukrainian situation is from an economic and social point of view still increasingly difficult and worrying. We agreed already in December with Ukraine, during our first Association Council meeting, a list of priorities that are now trying to become concrete steps. On the government side, we see the full political will to pursue reforms. We also see and understand very well the difficulties of implementing, passing reforms in times of conflict.  I am talking about constitutional reforms, decentralisation, reform of the judiciary, electoral reforms, just to mention the political ones. But then we also have economic reforms, not only macroeconomic in their nature, but also reforms that need to change fundamentally the system in which the economy in Ukraine is working, starting first of all with tackling corruption.  This is all very much linked to the implementation of the Association Agreement, parts of which have already been provisionally applied since 1 November, as you know very well since you ratified this at the same time as the Parliament in Kiev back in September.  At this level, the European Union is giving support not only politically and technically, but also economically. You know that the Commission has just proposed an additional package, a third package, of EUR 1.8 billion, and I trust that this measure will find your support here in Parliament. We are also working through the Support Group for Ukraine to implement the measures that are foreseen by our Association Agreement. We deployed an advisory mission to assist in the implementation of the civilian security sector reform and a third sector on which our work and our assistance is concentrating is obviously facilitating the gas negotiations between Russia and Ukraine to ensure security of supply. I will stop here and listen very carefully, as I did last time, to your debate – our debate – and take stock of that. Let me say that probably the big opportunity we have today, from this European Parliament, is to launch a message and the message from my side would be to the parties, firstly, obviously, to Russia, but to all those that will meet tomorrow night in Minsk: that they should take this opportunity and finally come to agree on the implementation measures of the Minsk Agreement.  This is what it is all about and this is the only way in which we can start finding the way out of the crisis. I think that, here, today, we have the opportunity to send the message that, yesterday, the Ministers of the 28 Member States sent, united, very clearly: that this is a chance that must not be missed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 300, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Jacek SARYUSZ-WOLSKI", "mepid": "28297", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, if tomorrow’s Minsk II last-chance talks fail to bring credible peace in the face of the naked war by Russia against Ukraine and the mountains of lies and broken promises, it will at last be time to move away from the logic of persuasion to the logic of deterrence. The EU has shown angelic patience and indulgence – and the word ‘angelic’ comes from the name Angela – but we have reached our limits. Quantitative and qualitative change in our action is needed because so far we have been doing too little, too late. Enhancing Ukrainian defence capabilities would create incentives for Russia to back down. On the contrary, the Russian military advantage over Ukraine openly invites Russia to continue the invasion, as we are witnessing. Ukraine has the right to defend itself. We have the responsibility to protect the victim against the aggressor in the name of our values. If we surrender our values, we ourselves will be in danger. The crisis in Ukraine is indeed about our own future and our own security. We may wish for there to be a diplomatic solution, but a military solution by Russia is taking place before our eyes. In order to achieve a political solution, leverage is needed to bring the aggressor to true – not Potemkin-village type – negotiations and to bring binding and executable results. The time has come to apply reverse logic, increase leverage through pressure, increase economic sanctions against Russia and close the gap in Russia’s military advantage – the gap between invader and victim – in order to achieve a peaceful solution in the end.

It must therefore be clear to all parties to the conflict that failure of the talks would inevitably lead to a further escalation of the conflict and thus to even more deaths, injuries and refugees.

Secondly, Ukraine can rely on our political and economic support. There will be no military solution to the conflict. The supply of weapons would not help to defuse the conflict, but would have the opposite effect. That is why we reject arms deliveries to Ukraine.

Russia is providing heavy military equipment, financial assistance and combat troops to the so-called separatists, sparking a conflict in which over 5 000 people have now lost their lives – 263 civilians alone in the last six days and 1.5 million people displaced.  As we approach tomorrow’s Minsk deadline for a renewed attempt at a ceasefire, rebel troops are surrounding the important railway hub of Debaltseve and I have just heard of further criminal attacks today on civilian areas by the rebels in Kramatorsk in which at least seven civilians were killed. So sadly, even if a ceasefire can be agreed tomorrow – and I hope that I am wrong in what I am about to say – it is unlikely in my view to end the conflict. As recently noted by the British Foreign Secretary, Putin is behaving like a 1930s tyrant and such agreements are merely part of a dissembling approach to gradually legitimise territorial gains before embarking on another round of attacks. Ukraine is not an isolated area of foreign policy for Putin, but part of his wider dream to reconstitute a crony capitalist, authoritarian greater Russia and to challenge the post-Cold War settlement and legal order. Challenging NATO and the Western alliance is therefore part of his mission. Maintaining unity on EU sanctions against Russia is of importance and excluding Russia from the SWIFT system could be the next step.  Militarily, we must not allow Russian intimidation to prevent so-minded EU states from supplying the Ukrainian armed forces the means to defend themselves and to deter Russia’s ability to steal more territory from Ukraine.

It is quite clear to me that this move by Mrs Merkel and President Hollande was an important attempt to turn the tide. It is important that the two in Kiev consulted President Poroshenko, consulted with him before, for the first time in a long time, they got the main person responsible for this whole war in the East, namely President Putin, at the table. The whole of the European Union is looking at what is happening. I believe that two European Heads of State have not had and have not had so much support from citizens throughout the European Union for a long time, because it is about peace. That is what the European Union stands for. That is what Europeans would like to preserve in the EU. They want this peace to which we have become accustomed. However, you must also understand that, at the same time, the mood in Ukraine is very different. More and more people want to be able to return to a life without war. I am always fascinated by the fact that this people in Ukraine have not completely run out of air. They have thought so many times that there is now a turning point for the better, but every time a turn came for the worse. They, too, are now looking at what is happening in Minsk, but are far from as optimistic as we are, but rather are afraid that once again – as always in Minsk – there will be such a salami tactic, which will ultimately lead to a worsening of the situation in eastern Ukraine. I don't know. I hope, I have to say, a miracle. But I don't believe in a miracle, even if Angela is in the game. I very much agree with my colleague Mr van Baalen that if this attempt fails, we will have to re-talk about what we can do. There has been far too much hesitation and indecision in the European Union. The sanctions – I have to think of Mr Hahn, who represents Austria – Austria, others have repeatedly doubted that we, as soft power, have an alternative to military means. But we will have to discuss it again if Minsk fails. We will also have to discuss what this actually means, that we always say that Ukraine has a right to defend itself. If the idea of the Euromajdan falls, if the idea of freedom, the rule of law and justice – that is what it was all about – falls, then a piece of Europe actually falls.

The question is, will the negotiations on Crimea also concern?  I would like to draw attention to one more thing. Ladies and again, Europe unfortunately shows all the time its powerlessness towards Vladimir Putin, who simply laughs and implements his imperial policy in Ukraine. The Russian tank cannot be stopped by europe pouring sand under its tracks, or by limiting its fuel supply so that it can drive more slowly. Fuel supplies should simply be cut off. This requires decisive action and strong sanctions, not a discussion that we will lose out on our economic interests and therefore let what it wants to happen in Ukraine, let Russia do what it wants. Finally, the latter makes – Putin disregards all agreements so far.

Well, but not even a euro to poor Greece that is on its knees, which your austerity policy has brought to its knees. So let's see what causes this crisis.

Russia is an aggressor, a party to the conflict and has broken international law. We must take note of this clearly. It is important that Russia, as a party to the conflict, takes responsibility. We must see that sanctions are our instrument – not weapons, but sanctions, because we do not want war – to tell the aggressor that the costs are high, and that is where we can do so in case of need. We have to see that the government in Kiev – the thieves were the Yanukovych people, Mr Ransdorf – that the politicians in Ukraine, the government elected by the people for a pro-European course, are having difficulty in enforcing their reform process, because a war is being waged in their country by a foreign power and costing money. That is why you should not reverse things. The ability to compromise, which is being demanded by the Ukrainian Government in these hours in order to make a ceasefire possible, is a tremendous achievement.

We must understand that our institutions must work for peace and reconciliation with Russia, not for hatred and war.  Our Parliament must recover if it is to maintain a minimum of credibility, but also of dignity and responsibility.

That is why it seems to me that today we must make it clear that we are really in for a peaceful solution, for the territorial integrity of Ukraine, including in the conflict against international law an annexed Crimea, that we give Ukraine the right to self-defense because it is also allowed by the Charter of the United Nations, and that we want restrictive measures towards Russia to continue. Because it is obvious that only by combining all these measures of our policy can we lead to the dissection of the situation, to respect the Minsk ceasefire, and I hope that tomorrow's meeting in Minsk, combined with the \"Normandy format\" will give one qualitative step forward. Because what we've seen over the past weeks, what we've seen in Mariupol, what we've seen in Donetsk, what we've seen in Debal'cev, what we saw today at crematorium, is a disaster. A catastrophe for Ukraine, a catastrophe for the Ukrainian people and a disaster for the European Union. In this regard, I also hold Russia to account. Russia is a global actor, a nuclear power. Where does Russia go with this kind of policy? It reminds me a little of that line: where there's a Russian, there's Russia. He can't do that. Other countries' borders, their ambitions, their orientation must be respected.  If Ukraine cannot go down the path chosen by its people, its rule in democratic elections, then this is not good, then all of Russia's neighbors are in trouble. And it is an additional responsibility of all of us, that here and through the mechanisms we have in implementing the Association Agreement, in support of The Supreme It works by Parliament to do European reforms in the years ahead, to bring it closer to the European project, that is our main task.

But it was the enchantment of reality, and the enchantment of reality never leads to effective politics. It is no wonder, then, that European policy is powerless and has not keeping up with developments. In fact, the conflict in Ukraine is being resolved militarily before our eyes. Whoever does not see it is under delusion. One side of the conflict – Russia – has relied on military means from the outset and has not hesitated to hand over arms to the separatists. Russia has never accepted our axiom and therefore immediately had an advantage in political disputes and diplomatic games.  Recent proposals to freeze the conflict would mean that this strategy has been successful and that the force has prevailed. They would mean that by using military means Russia could divide Ukraine, de facto mean the surrender of Ukraine, as well as the defeat of the West.

Therefore, many people agree that there is no military solution to the conflict and that it is equally harmful to the European Union, ukraine, Russia, but ukrainian citizens in particular feel the seriousness of the situation. They feel insecurity in their daily lives, they live in fear, poverty, and Russian propaganda only exacerbates this situation with scaremongering.

What kind of mandate is there for the initiative discussed here and which – here in this room as well as in the newspapers – is called the German-French initiative? I am sure that everybody sitting in this room has heard of something called the ‘Normandy format’. It was started some months ago and is something we refer to in our Council conclusions. To see what kind of European Union mandate there exists behind this initiative, you can look at all the Foreign Affairs Council conclusions over the last six or seven months – and I think also some European Council conclusions. Allow me to read to you parts – not all but a few sentences – of the last Foreign Affairs Council conclusions of 19 January 2015, before the initiative was taken. In those conclusions, all 28 Foreign Ministers, and I will come back again to unity, referred to the Berlin Joint Statement by the Foreign Ministers of France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine of 21 January, and we said: ‘All signatories of the Minsk agreements should convene as a matter of urgency within the framework of the trilateral contact group.’ This is something which is happening at the present time.  This is an OSCE, and not a European Union, exercise. However, I think it is not only our right, but our duty to recall the positive effort on the diplomatic side. Because I am saying that the present initiative is a European initiative, let me now read you a sentence that to me is the basis for our common work: ‘The European Union will actively support all diplomatic efforts conducive to creating a new political impetus […]. Full implementation of the Minsk agreements as the basis for a sustainable political solution to the conflict […] must remain the focus of such talks’.  To those who ask me about the kind of mandate for this initiative, I would say that it is exactly this. It is a normal Normandy format initiative, like many of the ones that we have had. Unfortunately it has not been as successful in the last months but I hope this one will bring some results. This is a decision taken by the 28 Foreign Ministers, by the Council. So I understand if, for internal political reasons and party politics, some groups and some Members of this Parliament take it as a way of attacking one or the other, but, believe me, this is a European initiative. It goes in the European direction and has to have all Europeans supporting it and not just applauding it. Some of you have rightly said that the important thing is that it gets results. If it gets results everybody should applaud it. I would say, not only applaud it but ‘actively support’ it. Let me say that I am very pleased to hear, especially on this side of the Chamber, a lot of support for ‘more Europe’. This does not happen often and I appreciate it very much. I also appreciate having so many supporters.  I know very well what my role is. At this particular moment, my role is to actively support those efforts by trying to get them to bring about a positive result. How? Firstly, by keeping our unity. Our unity makes the headlines only when we do not have it. But we all know very well that a crucial part of our response to this crisis is to keep our unity in political efforts and in diplomatic exercises, and when we exert pressure on Russia through sanctions.  In recent weeks we have had two Foreign Affairs Councils. In both of them, in very difficult political conditions, we all went into a room not being 100% certain that we would come out of that room completely united along the same lines and with some substantial result. This was done. It does not make the headlines and I am happy about that. I am happy if it does not make the headlines. I am less happy if it is underlined that we are not involved in negotiations or that we are not pursuing diplomatic efforts. Maybe when I am in a room with Mr Lavrov, Mr Poroshenko, Mr Klimkin, Mr Kerry or Mr Biden this can be considered a European effort. This is a European exercise, and do not play politics around it because this is serious. (Applause) Someone spoke of where we were. They correctly said, and I will reiterate the sentence: We are at Minsk II to implement Minsk I. We have to do all that we can to make it work and this is not the day to be thinking of what we do if this does not happen. We will have a day after; we will have one week after; we will have one month after. I agree with the Member on one month after, but one day after is probably not too late. If you want a diplomatic effort to succeed, you do not start planning Plan B before you get there. That is a basic rule, not only of diplomacy but of common sense. So what we have to do now is to insist on two things. Firstly, not to have a political and security environment that does not allow the meeting tomorrow to be successful. We have a collective responsibility. Obviously it is not primarily our responsibility but it is primarily the responsibility of those on the ground. Maybe I missed something today, but I think there is an awareness of the fact that, in any kind of negotiation, whenever we get closer to the moment when the parties have to meet, violence increases. This is what worries me most. So the first responsibility we have is to keep unity. Secondly, we must direct all our work, even parliamentary diplomacy, towards achieving a result that will facilitate a common European effort. Thirdly, we should try to make sure that the environment leading to tomorrow night’s meeting can allow a result. Fourthly, and in agreement with some of the last comments that were made, we must not only bring about a ceasefire but ensure the ceasefire can be implemented and monitored and that it is sustainable. This also means creating a framework for the ceasefire.  Now it is not for me to go into the details of what is being negotiated now. Obviously we are talking and exchanging information, but you do not necessarily issue a press release about that. I think we are all grown up enough to understand that very well. Maybe you are right that I should not assume this. Still I think that we are all very much aware of the fact that we have different steps to take and that we have a huge historical responsibility, not only a political one. Let me touch upon two things that were mentioned because I also think they were very important. Firstly, someone mentioned the need to reinforce the role of the OSCE and the monitors; I fully agree. I am very much involved in this network of diplomatic efforts. One of the people I talk to the most is Heidi Tagliavini who is doing an excellent job. I think in this sense that we are doing a lot already but if we come to a stage where monitoring is required we definitely will need to reinforce that instrument. Another point that was raised – and I will conclude on this – concerns Ms Savchenko. I am not sure whether or not you have already received my reply to your letter about that where I tried to list what we are trying to do. This is not easy. We are in contact with lawyers and our people in the delegation are trying to attend the trial, but it is not easy to get a guarantee in that environment. We are working on that and we are aware of that. Let me assure you that this case, and other cases of people illegally detained in Russia, are being closely followed by our service. Thank you very much for this discussion. For me at least, it was useful. I hope it was also useful to send out a clear message that not only are we united when it comes to the Council, the 28 Member States, but on this matter that we can also be increasingly united in Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 367, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "   The debate is closed.

The upcoming NPT Review Conference, which will be held in New York from 27 April to 22 May, is something to which I attach a great deal of importance. It is the most important event on global non-proliferation and disarmament this year. I announced already during the hearing in this Parliament in October that I intended to put in a great deal of work on this and I can confirm that I intend to participate in the Review Conference, in the opening session, and to address the meeting.  I also believe that the role of Parliament in this is crucial. If I am not mistaken, it was the case in 2010 that Parliament adopted a resolution helping to shape the European Union position and I think that it will be extremely good – well, this is our first chance – to have a constant dialogue so that our position is somehow a common European position, taking in the view of Parliament too.  Let me thank you too for all those occasions where the EEAS has been invited to relevant committees on this topic. It is something I appreciate very much.  Now, coming to this year’s Review Conference, there is a mixed outlook, as you know very well. There are different views on the level of implementation of the 2010 Action Plan, and these views are probably quite difficult, or increasingly difficult, to reconcile. I think that, in this context, it is also important not to lose sight of a couple of issues that are regional issues but still relevant to the conference itself.  On one side, the ongoing negotiations with Iran that the European Union, as you know, is facilitating – I am personally facilitating – following a UN Security Council resolution and which could demonstrate that a peaceful solution to a serious issue is possible and mutually profitable for all.  Another element that is likely to influence the outcome of the Review Conference is the fact that the Conference on the Weapons of Mass Destruction-Free Zone in the Middle East, which was one of the key elements of the 2010 Action Plan, has not taken place yet. Here let me thank the facilitator of this for his efforts – his endless efforts – and I hope that all our support can lead to the conference being convened sooner rather than later. When it comes to the disarmament pillar of the NPT, there has been a growing debate, taking place mostly outside of NPT meetings, on the issue of the catastrophic humanitarian consequences of any use of nuclear weapons. A major international discussion on this subject was recently held in Vienna, organised by Austria. While some want to elaborate a legal ban on nuclear weapons, others advocate a building-block approach to disarmament with step-by-step nuclear reductions, taking into account the current security environment. It is an ongoing debate. As you know the European Union has different Member States, with different histories, different positions, and different sensibilities we would say.  But I was encouraged first of all by the fact that during the recent conference in London, the five NPT nuclear-weapon states reconfirmed their commitment to achieving a world without nuclear weapons, in accordance with the goals of the NPT, and made further contributions to developing the mutual confidence and transparency which is essential to making progress towards multilateral nuclear disarmament.  I think that the conference – even if, as I said, we are still in the process of shaping our formal position on that – should deliver a vision first of all on how to strengthen the Treaty as a whole. We are, as I said, currently preparing with our Member States the common position for the conference and I think that even if the Member States’ mix is complex – nuclear weapon states, NATO members, neutral states – I am confident that we will achieve a common position as we have done in the past.  I believe personally, but this is also the EU position, that the NPT is and has to remain the cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, as the essential foundation for the pursuit of nuclear disarmament. It is also an important element in the further development of nuclear energy applications for peaceful purposes. We, as you know, support the universalisation and the effective implementation of the NPT.  I believe that we will have to continue to promote a more comprehensive, balanced and substantive implementation of the Action Plan adopted at the 2010 NPT Review Conference, and this Action Plan has been our common roadmap to this Review Conference. However, I believe that we will also call on all NPT States Parties to live up to their commitments of 2010 and to do all that we can to ensure that the Conference delivers a common vision on how to implement these commitments.  I know that we do not have so much time but let me quickly go into some of the details of the European Union position, as it is shaping up with regard to the three NPT pillars, with the caveat that the common position is not official yet and is underdeveloped.  On disarmament, we have to reaffirm, I believe, that it is our commitment to pursue nuclear disarmament in accordance with Article 6 of the NPT and stress the need for concrete progress in this field, especially through an overall reduction in the global stockpile of nuclear weapons.  We will welcome the considerable reductions made so far, taking into account the special responsibility of the states that possess the largest arsenals, and we will welcome indications of progress reported by the United States and the Russian Federation in implementing the new START Treaty and strongly encourage them to seek further reductions in their nuclear arsenals, including strategic, non-strategic, deployed and non-deployed weapons, and in this atmosphere I guess this will be the most challenging exercise.  We will welcome and encourage the nuclear-weapons states’ conferences on the follow up of the 2010 NPT Review Conference, including confidence-building, transparency, verification activities and discussions on reporting. We will stay committed to Treaty-based nuclear disarmament and arms control and stress the need to renew multilateral efforts and revitalise multilateral negotiating bodies, in particular the Conference on Disarmament. The ongoing stalemate, including the persistent failure to agree on a programme of work remains, I think, not only troubling but also unacceptable. I think it is time to call for the immediate commencement and early conclusion of the negotiations, in the Conference on Disarmament, on a treaty banning the production of fissile materials for nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices. One point to which I attach particular importance and on which I have always been active personally is the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which I believe is of crucial importance to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. I would continue, even personally, to work for its entry into force as a top priority (obviously not only by myself but by the European Union), continuing to promote this objective not only to diplomatic action but also to financial engagement. We have contributed substantially to the CTBT Organisation since 2006 and I take the opportunity to thank Parliament for its support for the CFSP financing provided to this end. As I said, I have been and I will stay personally engaged in the efforts made by the CTBT Organisation regarding the dialogue with the Annex 2 states whose ratifications are needed for the Treaty to enter into force. On non-proliferation, the European Union view: the international community continues to be faced with major proliferation challenges. This is very evident to us and must be addressed in a resolute way in order to maintain the credibility and the effectiveness of the NPT regime. I would stress the primary responsibility of the UN Security Council for maintenance of international peace and security, including the cases of non-compliance. I will not mention individual cases; if necessary, I could go back to some cases that Members might raise in their speeches. On the peaceful use of nuclear energy: the EU will reaffirm its support for the right of all parties to the Treaty to develop research, production and use of nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, without discrimination, and in conformity with the Treaty.  Let me at the very end – last but not least – mention nuclear security. I think that the Nuclear Security Summit process is crucial and stays crucial. I personally followed it when I was a Member of Parliament myself and a minister afterwards. I think it is key to reducing the threat of nuclear terrorism, something that is still very relevant, and to securing all vulnerable nuclear material in the coming years.  We are, and stay, committed to supporting the leading role played by the IAEA, including through financial support provided by the European Union to the Nuclear Security Fund. It has been substantial – EUR 40 million since 2004 – and for that I also have to express my gratitude to Parliament for having chosen to support that financial effort.  Thank you very much and I am looking forward to your ideas.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 380, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the High Representative, thank you very much for your statement.

After all, the Budapest Convention of 1994 had as its central point that Ukraine should renounce its nuclear weapons and, in return, be guaranteed its borders by the great stake, the United States, Russia and the United Kingdom. The way Russia behaves in this case, of course, is not an incentive for a country to give up nuclear weapons. On the contrary, it also has the effect of some countries considering whether it might not be a better insurance to acquire nuclear weapons in the first place. That cannot be in our interest.

It is time to demand and strive for the NPT to lead to the total elimination of nuclear weapons in the world. The timing is urgent, and not just because of the Review Conference this year. Once again we are witnessing a geostrategic conflict in Europe, with war in Ukraine, caused dangerously by a nuclear power, Russia, in violation of a nuclear regulation treaty, the Budapest Protocol of 1994. But the resurgence of war and armed conflict and terrorism on European soil and in the nearest neighbourhood, the Middle East and North Africa, by state and non-state actors, cannot justify an arms race. On the contrary, the world must demonstrate that it has learned from the mistakes of the past. Nuclear weapons are not deterrents, on the contrary, proliferation leads to more proliferation. We must achieve the agreement of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by Israel, India, Pakistan, and the re-entry of North Korea into the disarmament regime and control by the International Atomic Energy Agency.  So far we have failed to give npt effectiveness. The oldest nuclear states fail: the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Russia and China, which, while maintaining nuclear arsenals. They will have no moral authority to preach disarmament to other countries and fail those who, in recent decades, have entered the club of nuclear states refusing to join the NPT. They do not disclose the number of nuclear warheads, refuse international control and thus mutually fuel suspicion and mistrust. Cases from India, Pakistan, Israel and Iran. In order to ensure the strengthening of the NPT, it is also necessary, as the High Representative stressed, that the CTBT should finally enter into force. Madam High Representative, in addition to the common position for the next NPT review conference, we need the involvement of the NPT by those who have not yet done so to be part of the regular dialogues of the European Union with the countries concerned.

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty is a one-of-a-kind international treaty aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons and promoting the peaceful use of nuclear technology. But today, given the circumstances and threats from Islamic State and islamic extremism in general, we need to be very careful when talking about disarming nuclear arsenals. That is why I call on the participants in the upcoming Treaty Review Conference to concentrate their efforts on the risk of nuclear arsenals falling into unwanted hands, not just in ways to disarm them.  To acknowledge, yes, there is an opinion that these weapons of mass destruction are a threat to humanity, but they also constitute an essential element of the national security of many countries and are a guarantor of stability, security and peace in many regions. Today's conditions call for more emphasis on enhancing the security of nuclear weapons systems.  That is why I believe that the disarmament of nuclear arsenals must be achieved gradually and only through international treaties and cooperation in this field, while continuing to promote the peaceful use of nuclear technology, because my first belief is that cleaner, safer and cheaper energy than nuclear does not.

The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty was the consequence of the US atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The threat of nuclear weapons is not and must never be a political or military means. But even two decades after the end of the Cold War, the earth is still contaminated by thousands of nuclear weapons. The civil war in Ukraine must not be the reason to jeopardise the Treaty. On the contrary! We need to discuss what role the EU should play, can and, yes, wants to play in particular. It is undeniable that there are hardliners on different sides. And yet last weekend, the five nuclear powers, China, Britain, Russia, the US, and France, issued a joint statement reaffirming their commitment to nuclear disarmament and diplomatic conflict resolution. However, it is not only here in this House that this does not seem to be of great interest. The press hardly reports on this either, although it is precisely at this time that such conferences can be a confidence-building measure and would lend credibility to the will for peace of all parties.

As Mrs Lösing has just mentioned, there does not appear to be a resolution here from Parliament this time, unlike previous NPT reviews.  I would therefore urge my colleagues here that we actually also support a joint resolution, the groups that have not yet done so. As Mr Gahler also said, we actually have a broad consensus. Why, then, are we afraid to express it and give the Commissioner the support we want to give her in this very important work? As we see it, the non-proliferation treaty is an extremely important issue, and it is important that we do not allow it to be watered down.  We had a hearing on this the other week in committee. As I understood it then, the conditions are not so good to get the agreement tightening. Rather, it seems today that the parties to the Non-Proliferation Treaty during the 2015 Review Conference will only conclude that they could not implement the action plan adopted in 2010. The same applies to the action plans adopted before then. So if we or the Member States are not looking to close down this agreement, we are at a crucial time right now.  This is at the same time as our security environment in the East and South has changed dramatically for the worse, thereby also increasing the risk that the weapons will actually be used. So if europe is not involved in driving, the risk is very high that we will soon be faced with nuclear anarchy in an increasingly unstable world.  I would therefore call on Commissioner Mogherini to do his utmost to achieve a strong and progressive common position for the review conference.

There is one very positive recent element which gives us an opportunity to restore confidence in the possibility of limiting sensitive nuclear activities: progress in the talks with Iran since the election of their new government. Fundamental disagreements on key issues seem to have been overcome. I believe we should translate progress in the talks with Iran into an agreement that establishes a comprehensive joint action plan enacting strong non-proliferation instruments for verification and as safeguards. Such a forward-looking and meaningful agreement, if translated into broad international norms, would be a great boost to the NPT talks. This is my opinion: it is absolutely necessary. More transparency and disarmament on the part of nuclear weapon states are a fundamental step forward in the European security strategy. Now the bad side of the apple: let me remind you, High Representative, of the Budapest Memorandum that already was mentioned here from 1994, that led to the fact that Ukraine gave up its nuclear weapons in exchange for security guarantees.

This is the core of the European Union message to the NPT Review Conference. Someone else said, with a generational reference – and I very much share their view, and I guess some of the Members here will also share it – that it seems obvious to a large part of the European population that we should not even need to discuss these issues. However, I believe that we have a long way to go in the world. Obviously, we have a long way to go on the non-proliferation pillar, and the negotiations on the Iranian nuclear programme will, as I said, impact on the conference itself. I hope that we will see substantial developments by then, and I can assure you that I am playing my personal role, with all the dedication possible, to make those talks positive. This could be a historic opportunity because, while we are talking about disarmament, the non-proliferation pillar is just as important as disarmament. One reinforces the other in a sort of credibility cycle, which is why we have to work on the three pillars of the Treaty together. Just let me mention two things from the debate that I would like to underline. The issue of a resolution is obviously in your hands and not in mine. Still, I take this debate as an encouragement, and I would very much appreciate keeping this channel open, as you mentioned, through the committees here, with a view to the preparation for the conference – firstly because the European Parliament has a voice to raise, and also because it is important that we keep the channel open for communication on these issues with civil society organisations, public opinion movements and national parliaments. I believe that this is one of the things that affect our security and the security of our citizens very much. Sometimes there is an illusion that the NPT is about goodwill, good feelings or the good sentiments of some naive persons around the world: in fact, it is very much linked to our security and it is a security debate that we are having.  The last thing I would say is that it is precisely because of the security threat and the tensions around us that we need to work on this: on implementation, on all sorts of disarmament measures and on the steps that have been started in the last decade and the last few years. Someone mentioned the Obama doctrine, with the Prague speech, and the fact that it provided an impetus which was very relevant. We should not allow the tensions that we are facing in the world – not only in Europe but also elsewhere – to detract from the real purpose of our work on the NPT and the connected treaties, which is to increase our security, and not to relinquish it. I want you to be assured of my personal dedication to that, and I will obviously try to do my best to make sure that the European Union’s voices are not only united but also strong at the conference in New York.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 397, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "  Thank you High Representative Mogherini.

Mr President, let us start with some basic truths: if it did not exist, it would have to be invented. We are talking, of course, about the ACP-EU Joint Parliamentary Assembly. It was within the framework of this parliamentary cooperation that it was possible to exchange, through the representatives of the peoples, on political issues of common interest. This dialogue has made the Assembly an essential instrument of democratisation. If this is the perception at the level of the 78 parliaments of the ACP and the European Parliament, public opinion, on the other hand, could be better informed. It had become accustomed to the Member State of the European Union presiding over the Council of the Union hosting the acp-EU annual meeting in its capital, or at another location chosen by the Presidency of the Union. In recent years, this habit has been lost. It is a pity because, by the same to the very end, we are depriving ourselves of making the work of this House better known to a public opinion which is overwhelmingly in favour of development policy. We want to see the future States that must assume the presidency of the Union return to a well-established tradition. As for the more political aspects of this original parliamentary cooperation, the wealth of contributions dealing with the most diverse issues, including governance, security issues and ACP-EU cooperation as a whole, should be retained, namely cooperation first at the regional level, and then, in particular, in the area of economic partnership agreements between these regions and the European Union. , without ignoring, of course, and I should have started with that, development cooperation itself. Mr President, although little is said about this, the ACP-EU dialogue on respect for fundamental values is becoming more and more important in our debates. Issues relating to non-discrimination in particular give rise, from time to time, to extremely lively debates. On the European Union side, we have very specific issues to solve - I am referring here to the budgeting of the European Development Fund, which is the instrument for financing ACP-EU relations. As long as the European Parliament does not have the prerogatives inherent in any parliament, especially in budgetary matters, we are rather embarrassed when we invite the ACP states to develop parliamentary democracy at home. Let us say, however, that the anomaly to which I have just referred should definitely be a thing of the past. If we could turn our backs on the past, we could more calmly address future debates and challenges.  Before concluding, I would like to focus on the challenge that will overshadow all others, namely the future of EU-ACP relations, which, it must be remembered, will expire in 2020. From my point of view, it is not too early to start thinking about the nature of our relationship in the future. If we do a countdown - and this in the event of a renewal in one form or another of the Cotonou agreement - it is important to devote it to it now. The European Parliament, and in particular its Committee on Development, would be well advised to endorse Commissioner Mimica's proposal to make an initiative report on post-Cotonou. In fact, we could have thought about it ourselves, since any parliamentary initiative would have to be initiated by parliamentarians themselves. Considering only the judicious nature of his appeal, it goes without saying that we cannot fail to address this reflection as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 400, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Neven Mimica", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, the Joint Parliamentary Assembly is a unique forum for strengthening the European Union’s and ACP cooperation and connecting people in Europe and our partner countries through their directly elected representatives. I share the view expressed by the rapporteur, Mr Goerens, that we have successfully managed to extend our exchanges and work beyond purely technical and administrative matters. We have indeed been using our meetings more and more strategically to discuss issues of mutual concern.  Discussions that we had during the last Joint Parliamentary Assembly in Strasbourg on policy coherence for development, on Ebola, or on the post-2015 development agenda have been substantial. I expect the same level of engagement and input on post-Cotonou negotiations. Let me now move to the important recommendations made in this report to the Commission. On European Development Fund programming, I am happy that Parliament is now providing comments on EDF programming documents and I am confident that this new practice will improve the effectiveness and accountability of our development policy. On Economic Partnership Agreements (EPAs), I share the view that trade should support and serve development objectives. This is a vision I will pursue, working closely with Trade Commissioner Malmström.  The development objective has been the core objective of the EPA process from its very beginning. It is translated into concrete provisions in the Economic Partnership Agreements, including a great deal of asymmetry in the commitment and obligations, in measures promoting regional integration and in a number of special measures and safeguards. These provisions allow our ACP partners to promote their industrial development and protect their infant industries, food security and natural resources.  The European Union also supports the related reform and adjustment process and helps ACP countries to develop their trade capacities, enhance their competitiveness and make themselves less vulnerable to risks.  EPAs also ensure long-term free access for all products to the EU market. This is unparalleled in any other trade arrangements and is a key for investors’ location and sourcing decisions. We have heard our developing partners say on many occasions that they want trade and investment even more than our development money.  But we have also heard some of the specific concerns about the concrete potential of EPAs to contribute positively to trade facilitation and policy coherence for development. We would be ready to work with our partners to assess the Economic Partnership Agreements’ functioning and implementation in order to maximise their trade and development potential. On policy coherence for development (PCD) I can only welcome the proposal that the Joint Parliamentary Assembly should appoint two standing co-rapporteurs on PCD because it is one of the Commission’s main priorities. As for Parliament’s call for an explicit reference in any future agreement to non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity, let me remind you that a second revision of the Cotonou Agreement has considerably expanded the list of topics for dialogue on specific political issues of mutual concern to include traditional grounds for non-discrimination, in line with provisions by which ACP countries are bound under international conventions. At the time the ACP States firmly opposed including LGBTI rights on this list. However, the new wording of Article 8(4), taken from the wording of Article 2 of the UN Declaration on the same subject, does not exclude the possibility of discussing LGBTI rights with ACP countries. The European Union has regularly engaged with ACP countries on human rights, including non-discrimination on LGBTI issues, and we are determined to do so in the future. Some Honourable Members have had direct experience of ACP reluctance to discuss this issue. I agree with you that we must find the best way to pursue dealing with this issue and I will continue working with you to this end. This will, together with other very important issues, be part of the forthcoming public consultation process on Cotonou or on the post-Cotonou Agreement, and I look forward to the opportunity of further engaging with Parliament and with the Joint Parliamentary Assembly.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 401, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Maurice PONGA", "mepid": "96931", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group.

Two of its main pillars are trade policy and development policy, but if there is no fiscal justice, development policy becomes mere charity. The Member States of the European Union sign bilateral treaties with these countries, which do include tax agreements, but they are perverse because, under the pretext of avoiding double taxation, they establish legal mechanisms that facilitate what is practically tax evasion in those countries, therefore diminishing their collection capacity. European transnationals, our companies, produce there at low cost and come here to tax, but they make use, there, of the infrastructures of those countries and, if a factory burns down, it is the firefighters who are going to put out the fire. And that's called being an exploiter. It is $160 billion that loses a year in tax evasion, which is much more than it received in official development aid.

These agreements are made in particular with ministries of economic affairs or ministries of finance or ministries of planning. In fact, the parliaments in those ACP countries are hardly involved. It should be our job to help our colleagues in the various African parliaments to really shape the control of these programmes. I believe that this will give the Joint Parliamentary Assembly added value. The second point is about the future. Frankly, I find it a little complicated for us to hold meetings with parliamentarians from Africa, the Caribbean and the South Pacific. We have a collection here that you really should call colonial. I would like to maintain the relationship with these different regions, but not in the form of ACP, when we are in need of renewal in 2020. It's a little weird to keep our view of the world where our colonies used to be.

One of these topics is the universality of human rights, the right to the dignity of every person, regardless of race, religion, nationality or sexual orientation. It is because of this last one that some MEPs, especially from Africa, believe that our European attitude is sometimes the basis for some new European cultural imperialism. Such a conclusion I think we all share here that she is guilty, but we must continue to work on dialogue with our colleagues from Africa. Of course, not emphasizing positions that are not universally accepted, sometimes even within the European Union, but that by insisting that human rights, precisely because they are based on natural law, apply to all people. Perhaps this one approach will help us reach one better understanding with colleagues from Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific, on controversial topics.

The Assembly actively monitors political, economic and social developments in the ACP States in an effort to promote development goals and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, including respect for fundamental social rights, democracy based on the rule of law and transparent and responsible governance, which are an integral part of sustainable development.  At the last session of the Strasbourg Assembly, I was co-rapporteur on the report on private sector development strategy, which was voted unanimously by both Houses and which, in the same vein, sets out ways of helping the private sector.

However, the ACP-EU Parliamentary Assembly will only be able to be effective if colleagues – as has already been mentioned – also take part in it here in Parliament.

A first to highlight the importance of the parliamentary dimension in the framework of ACP-European Union cooperation. The results obtained by parliamentary diplomacy, as well as the concept itself, have to be evidenced and also have to be valued. The truth is that many of the results achieved in the work of our House are not immediately or tangibly measurable or perceived by each and every one of our partner countries. It takes, of course, some time to bear fruit. That is why the parliamentary dimension of our cooperation should not, in our opinion, be diluted in future relations post-2020. And, as far as possible, it should even be strengthened. Already for its participation in the current debate on the future of ACP-European Union relations.  Another idea is to involve the increasing number of public administration actors at more decentralised levels – be they municipalities, regional governments or associations of municipalities – in an increasing connection to our parliamentary assembly. Contacts with the authorities are therefore important, but also with the living forces of civil society who can in some way contribute positively and proactively to the objectives set out in our cooperation. In conclusion, let me just highlight the undeniable role of the powers of proximity, in particular the municipalities, which, I believe, should become increasingly involved, in an informal but regular way, in our work of our Parliamentary Assembly, whether through specific meetings or through conferences, seminars or others, in order to enhance and take the message of our privileged cooperation further and further.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 422, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Cristian Dan PREDA", "mepid": "96838", "text": "   Mr President, I would like above all to congratulate Mr Goerens on his report and, in the spirit of what our Spanish colleague, Mr Lopez Aguilar, said earlier, I would also like to underline the exceptional nature of this joint Parliamentary Assembly.

The importance of involving neighbours and regional organizations in the management of these crises was affirmed at the time. Then there is election observation. Here, I believe that we have already established cooperation for the elections in Mali and for the second round of the presidential elections in Madagascar. I was part of those delegations and I remember that we worked very well with our ACP colleagues.

That is a point that is very close to my heart. That is why I would like to raise a critical point here. Over the years, I have watched how participation has evolved. While our ACP colleagues are, of course, taking part in a large number of participants, I note that on the European side, the presence is very much within the limits, to put it mildly. I find it unacceptable that at the last sitting we had here in Strasbourg, there were still 19 European colleagues to vote, although there could actually be 78. I believe that we must make a new commitment here. This commitment must be personally accepted by all parties involved. This starts with the co-president on the European side up to the latest delegate. That is what I expect from everyone! Only then can we also ensure that our colleagues on the ACP side show us the respect and confidence that are the prerequisites for this cooperation. Because we need to talk very soon about how we will reshape this when Cotonou 2020 is over. Then we will ask ourselves the question: will we continue this, or will we divide it up?

Madam President, at the end of this discussion, I would like to begin by thanking all the colleagues who have spoken on my report and on the EU-ACP relations in the parliamentary field. Secondly, I think I can see that there is agreement on several points that I think are quite politically important. I am thinking, in particular, of the appointment of two co-speakers on the work of our assembly. Furthermore, I believe that there is practically a consensus on all benches to start thinking now about the future of EU-ACP relations. It is not too early to begin: if we do a countdown, these negotiations still take several years, and that means we should start negotiating by 2018-2019 at the latest. This presupposes that we have first defined the European Parliament's broad guidelines in this area, of course in close collaboration with the Commission and the Council - I concede that it is more difficult with the Council, which is never present at our meetings, neither at the ACP-EU meetings, nor at the Committee on Development, where it is entitled to speak; it's a shame and it's a missed opportunity. Thirdly, the tightening of relations between the 78 ACP Member States and the 28 Member States of the European Union is - As Mr Neuser mentioned a few moments ago - a largely untapped opportunity. We have, he recalled, a strategic majority within the United Nations and in major conferences; 2015 is the year of major conferences, especially on the financing of official development assistance, it is an opportunity to seize.  We have also seen the extent to which the disagreement or lack of coordination between the 28 on the one hand and the 78 on the other, particularly in the trade negotiations, has virtually derailed the Doha development principle. That is why I invite you to look more closely at political mobilization.

It reflects a deeply entrenched gender inequality and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against women. It is always practiced on minors and is therefore also a violation of the rights of the child. It also violates the rights to health, safety and physical integrity. Some 140 million women worldwide are currently suffering the consequences of this practice. In December 2014, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a Resolution to intensify efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation. It calls on States to develop, support and implement strategies to prevent this practice, including training of medical staff, social workers and local and religious leaders, to ensure that they provide competent support and care services to women and girls at risk of mutilation. I will bring to this debate the words of Khadi Diallo, a member of the women's group's association for the Abolition of Sexual Mutilations: \"I will never forget that day. I was twelve years old, and my sister was ten. Like every summer, we were at our paternal grandparents' house. One morning, early, we went to see my aunt, my father's sister, whom we always wanted to visit. I didn't suspect anything. My aunt took me to the bathroom and she and several women pounced on me, grabbed me, knocked me down and separated my legs. I was screaming. I didn't see the knife, but I felt like I was being cut. There was a lot of blood. I cried, but they said, \"Don't cry. It's a disgrace when a woman cries. You're a woman now.\" Our mother came to see us. The first time he cried and kissed us. But there was nothing I could do. In Africa, the paternal family has the right to life and death over the child. They told us that a woman must be robust, suffered, reserved and not very talkative.\" This is a real testament, like that of millions of women around the world, also in Europe, who continue to be victims of injustice and inequality. In the countries of the Union where women victims of female genital mutilation live, this practice is most often carried out during a stay in the country of origin, although there are obvious indications that they also occur on the territory of the Union. A recent study by the European Institute for Gender Equality concluded that there are victims of mutilation in at least thirteen countries in the European Union. In November 2013, the European Commission published a Communication entitled 'Towards the elimination of female genital mutilation', which takes a cross-cutting approach to eliminating this practice. That is why we would like to take this debate to ask the Commission what action it has taken in this area and how it will help Member States to develop specific indicators, adopt and implement legislation, and how it will contribute to this policy in their external relations. We also want to know how your work on operational planning in the field of justice will be ensured is connected to existing commitments to end gender-based violence. There is another question which deserves our attention and which I would like to hear your answer to, which is: what concrete measures will the Commission take to ensure the protection of asylum seekers on grounds related to female genital mutilation, within the framework of the consolidated Directive on asylum seekers? As you can see, there are many issues that concern us about being able to end this practice with concrete actions that are within our competence. Eliminating female genital mutilation should be a priority on the international agenda. If the laws are not firmly enforced and are not very strict, the effort will be in vain. It is a practice that violates the most basic rights of girls and women, and has serious physical and psychological consequences. When a woman is informed about this, it is herself who protects her daughters and other girls in her community. Nor can we forget the work of cooperation between public institutions and organisations working in civil society, because it is essential to achieve the objective of ending in Europe a brutal practice of violence, which has no place in 21st-century Europe. Because if anyone intends to justify this practice under some excuses, let us say very high and very clear that respect for traditions and cultures has as its impassable limit respect for human rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 435, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, I want to thank Parliament, and particularly Ms García Pérez, for its efforts to eliminate female genital mutilation and its support for the work of the Commission and the European External Action Service outlined in the Communication entitled ʽTowards the elimination of female genital mutilationʼ and adopted on 25 November 2013.  The Commission strongly reaffirms its stance against all forms of violence against women, including female genital mutilation. This practice is a violation of human rights and of the rights of the child. It violates women’s and girls’ physical integrity, causing profound and life-long impacts on their health and their well-being, and can even led to death. Currently the Commission, together with the European External Action Service, is following up on the actions that we committed to in the Communication.  What are we doing on increasing knowledge? Estimates show that there may be as many as 125 million victims worldwide and 500 000 victims in the European Union alone. We have very little reliable information about how, by whom and where female genital mutilation is carried out. Therefore, improving knowledge is one of our main priorities. Together with the European Institute for Gender Equality, we will develop a common methodology and indicators to estimate the risk of female genital mutilation in all EU Member States. The European Institute studies will tell us more about the reasons behind female genital mutilation being continued or abandoned among migrants in the European Union. This will help us to create an effective strategy for ending the practice.  Now, what are we doing or what are we going to do on prevention? To bring about the social change necessary for families to abandon this tradition, legal action alone is not enough. This is why the Commission is supporting and will continue to support work at grassroots level, engaging communities that practise female genital mutilation both in the EU and abroad.  To this end, the Commission will very shortly open a call for proposals for EUR 4.5 million for transnational projects aiming to prevent, inform about and combat harmful practices in the European Union. The Commission is currently funding four national awareness-raising campaigns run by Member States that specifically target female genital mutilation. In our external actions we also support grassroots projects that aim at the abandonment of female genital mutilation. This includes projects with a specific component on justice or creating a protective environment for women’s rights. Thanks to the support of Parliament, a web-based platform will be developed for professionals who come into contact with girls at risk and victims of female genital mutilation. I would like to thank you for that here today. The Commission is working to include female genital mutilation in the development of a communication providing guidance for EU Member States on integrated child protection systems.  How are we protecting victims? The Victims’ Rights Directive should be transposed in November 2015. This Directive ensures victims of female genital mutilation easy access to well-functioning specialised support services and protects them against any threat of physical or emotional harm during criminal investigations and trial.  The Commission has organised several workshops with Member States on the implementation of the Directive. The most recent one took place last week on 6 February, the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation. The Commission is also disseminating training materials on female genital mutilation for legal practitioners through its e-Justice platform.  Let me end with a few words regarding the external dimension of our work. Access to justice and the promotion of laws protecting all the rights of women, including the right not to suffer from traditional harmful practices, are priorities also encompassed in the EUʼs policy strategy in its external action for women. To promote gender equality we use political and human rights dialogues with partner governments where we bring up women’s empowerment, human rights and women’s health issues. Secondly, we also support advocacy and lobbying initiatives to improve national legislation and the development of suitable national policies on women’s rights. Thirdly we support capacity-building initiatives for government officials and advocacy and awareness-raising for all sectors of society.  Once a year a gender-specific training course is organised in the External Action Service. This training is targeted at staff from the External Action Service, the Commission and Parliament based in their headquarters, in EU delegations and in missions related to the Common Security and Defence Policy and in Member States. Since 2012, Amnesty International has been invited to present a session on ending female genital mutilation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 436, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Constance LE GRIP", "mepid": "101580", "text": "  on behalf of the EPP group.

Madam President, mainly ladies, good evening, gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The problem of female genital mutilation does not seem to be a European problem. The term gives the impression that it is a problem of African tribes and their rituals. That would be bad enough – but the problem has immigrant us. So we now also have this heinous crime against women and girls.  With respect to the crimes here in our country, I would like to say that anyone who wants to practice female genital mutilation as a religious practice or whatever does not belong to our cultural circle does not belong to us, and it cannot be integrated into us.  We will neither tolerate nor accept FGM. We do not mutilate people. No men, no women, no boys and no little girls and babies. End of announcement! And on the crimes in Africa, let me make one point: the girls and women there need help. Misereor puts the number of women and girls affected at 157 million. And two million are to be added every year. Many, long not enough, but many get help. And that will not taste good for many people in this House – I would say too many – because they are building and nurturing images of enemies here. But a very large part of this aid is provided by the development aid works of the Christian Church, the Evangelical Church and the Catholic Church: Caritas, the Diakonie, Misereor, Missio, the German Episcopal Conference, Church in Need.

We are all quoting the projected figures on victims in the EU and worldwide, but in fact we are not able to say exactly how many girls are cut every year because there is a lack of reliable data. What we can say is that vulnerable girls, often from already isolated sections of our communities, are at the most risk. What effort is there now to collect this data and how will we tackle this practice if we do not know the scale of the issue? The Commission’s recent communication commits to helping Member States raise awareness and provide training for relevant professionals, and that is very welcome. In the UK the first and only case of prosecution of a Dr Dharmasena for not attending to FGM shows knowledge amongst key professionals remains woefully low. He says he never received any training on FGM in either his undergraduate or postgraduate studies and was not aware of any hospital policy on FGM. We have to provide training for teachers, doctors, policemen and other key professionals now, so that they can recognise the warning signs and will know what to do when presented with the evidence. Training takes only a few days but it could help prevent vulnerable girls from being forced to live with the consequences of FGM for the rest of their lives. Awareness-raising among professionals is a great start but of course that is not enough to end this brutal practice. We must all work closely with the communities, to start to change attitudes and to talk about this issue, supporting the brave women who refuse to allow their daughters to be cut and arming the girls with information so that they can recognise the warning signs and resist.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 440, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Malin BJÖRK", "mepid": "124992", "text": "  On behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Madam President, I would like to begin by thanking Theresa May for Female genital mutilation is a terrible form of violence against women and girls. It is true that patriarchal violence takes different attention in different contexts, but it always aims – always – to suppress women, limit our living space, our sexuality, our place in public space.  All violence against women and girls is traditionally deeply rooted in our tradition. I am strongly opposed to the fact that fgm, i.e. female genital mutilation, is lifted out of the broader work against violence against women. In order to be effective, it must be integrated into the broader work of combating all forms of violence against women and girls. Then we create solidarity, feminist solidarity, for a joint work in which all women and girls can live a life free from violence.  Perhaps the most difficult thing is to see the systematic and structural patriarchal violence on which the majority culture in Europe is built, ranging from the witch-burning of the past to today's impunity for rapists. Even those women who are not affected are indirectly restricted, through fear and caution, a self-limitation that creeps into our everyday lives, into our lives.  Violence against women and girls is a violation of human rights. That is why it is a fundamental problem of democracy. That is why the Commission urgently needs to come back with a legislative proposal on how to combat all forms of violence against women, including genital mutilation.

My presence here, although obviously a minority one, shows that, as has been said, this is not a problem that interests only women, but should be of interest to the whole of society. We are very pleased that this question is being asked because again we find ourselves with a huge distance between the Commission's words and the facts. The Communication of 25 November 2013 is, as has been said, a very good Communication, but we are not seeing the concrete steps to make it a reality: we miss that timetable. Female genital mutilation is a crime, a crime that must be prosecuted wherever it is committed. It is therefore important that the Commission requires the countries of the European Union not yet to apply the principle of universal justice to do so, and also to persecute those who take young women to non-EU countries to carry out mutilation there, so that they know that they will not go unpunished. And, in that sense, female genital mutilation is, above all, an act of violence against women. When is the Commission going to get to work to draft this effective and general directive against gender-based violence that we are asking of it? But this is not just a legal problem: only 41 cases of female genital mutilation have reached European courts, while 500,000 victims and 180,000 are at risk. Many of the women who suffer it assume it as an inevitable custom—they don't even know it's a crime—and many others cannot come to court because of the pressures of their environment. We must empower women to report, so that they know that all European institutions are at their side. We must work on educational and integration programmes because, as Unicef reports say, poverty and marginalization are the keys to continue this practice in Europe.

She was appointed, from that moment on, a UN spokesperson for this issue. On the wedding night, the husband grabs a knife or knife and cuts, before forcing his wife by force. If a woman is not ablation, she does not marry and is expelled from the village and treated like a prostitute. Families firmly believe that a woman has to submit to ablation to be pure.

Secondly, I stress the key role that the European Institute for Gender Equality must play in helping Member States develop specific indicators on FGM. Thirdly, on the external side of the policy to eradicate female genital mutilation, I draw your attention to the importance of perfect coherence and coordination between you, Commissioner, high representative, special representative on human rights and commissioners for development, humanitarian aid and migration. Three key words: coordination, exchange of information and complementary actions to give shape to the union's overall approach.  Fourthly, I think it is important to start thinking about the consideration of genital mutilation in migration policy. On the one hand, with regard to asylum applications and on the other hand, because we must also pay attention to girls from communities from emigrants in Europe and to the risk of being sent to their country of origin to undergo such mutilation.

This attitude of submission of the woman causes the girls to be sacrificed to find a husband and many parents support her. I transcribe the testimony of one of them: \"I was nine years old. My parents told me to get in the car, we were going to a party. I was surprised my brothers didn't come.

The list of actions presented here today by the Commissioner to eradicate this phenomenon is certainly significant, but it must be transformed into concrete actions, appropriate legislation, awareness-raising campaigns and an acceleration of cultural progress inside and outside Europe, aimed at combating, but above all preventing, this and all other forms of violence against women and girls.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 477, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Mary HONEYBALL", "mepid": "5846", "text": "   Madam President, I am speaking in this debate as someone who represents a city where there are communities where female genital mutilation (FGM) takes place.

There have been no successful prosecutions in the UK despite the fact that FGM has been a crime for some years. France has been a bit more successful. However, I think that what we need to do is really encourage the communities themselves to understand that this practice is wrong, and to understand those women, and they are mainly young women, who are willing to come forward.

I had only recently become acquainted with these figures, and I really did not know that this barbaric practice was so ingrained in our continent. I have looked at all the possible instruments that Europe has and the instruments that the Member States have, and I have to say that there is legislation on the part of the Member States that gives the possibility of prosecuting this practice when this particular method of mutilation is no longer directly mentioned in the Criminal Code, then there is always a criminal offence, which is a serious injury with lasting consequences, which is highly penalised in all criminal law-abiding European countries. , so I was really surprised at how little the legal possibility of prosecuting this barbaric crime is being used.  We're talking about zero tolerance for female circumcision. And yet, when we talk about zero tolerance of crime, it's as if we feel that it's self-evident. Zero tolerance for crime is something that's not being discussed. When we talk about zero tolerance for female genital mutilation, I have come up with arguments like – well, but it is a tradition – in the consultation on this matter. I mean, it's something that's been going on for centuries, and it can't just be eradicated. I will be the first to be in favor of preserving cultural traditions and the multit00 of cultures, but not for preserving a tradition that is in stark contrast to the law that has a place in the EU. So I say again, there are those instruments here, both the criminal law and the asylum directive that we are monitoring, which gives the Member States a direct obligation to deal with vulnerable groups of those who come to Europe to seek asylum, and specifically mentions the concern or attention directed at women and women who are at risk of this practice. So we have legislation in place. I think that the EU should – however it has been said here that we do not have the right to pressure the Member States – urge the Member States to make better use of the legal instruments that already exist and not to delay punishing this practice.  What we're missing is data. It also said here that we can't fight hard enough and convincingly enough with something that we don't really know how extensive it is and that we don't have mapped out. I could read here, and I do not want to delay, the statistics that we have from the Member States where this problem is very serious. I'm already surprised that we have the latest data from 2007 somewhere. This means that on the one hand we do not have fresh data, even this I do not understand why we are not trying to better map the problem and fresher data. And on the other hand, we have numbers that are probably just estimates, because, as I was warned, it's really hard to collect that data. So it is up to us to focus on this in cooperation with EIGE, and you know that I spoke here some time ago about the fact that we are working on a new strategy for gender equality and that an important chapter here will be a chapter on combating violence against women. And here we will also be dealing with the preparation or, in fact, the creation of an action plan that will bring about concrete steps that we will take. In my experience, however, the action plan will not be reliable enough if we do not have a reliable data base. So this is where we need to start, and like I said at the beginning, we're already working on it. I would end up at the moment, I think that this question or this problem will be repeated here periodically, because it is indeed a very serious problem, and I will be available not only here in plenary, but also in the meantime, to give information on how the Commission is acting.

Beyond fine speeches and political incantations, it is clear that this problem deserves zero tolerance.

These countries are Albania, Andorra, Armenia, Gabon, Morocco, Russia, Seychelles and Singapore. To date, a total of 93 countries have acceded to the Convention, including all EU Member States. The entry into force of the Hague Child Abduction Convention between EU Member States and the new States Parties has been delayed. The progress of the case awaited a ruling by the Court of Justice of the EU on whether the acceptance of the accession of the new States Parties falls within the competence of the EU or the Member States. In October 2014, the court ruled. The adoption of the accession of a third State to the Hague Convention in question falls within the exclusive competence of the European Union. Child abduction is a violation of human rights. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child guarantees that a child has the right, in principle, to live with his or her parents if he or she is good and safe to be with them. A child living separately from their parents has the right to meet and keep in regular contact with both parents. A meeting can only be prevented if it is against the best interests of the child.  What, then, are the legal means to find a solution to child abducting? The Hague Child Abduction Convention aims to implement these rights of the child. It contains the procedures for resolving cases of child abduction between States Parties.  Today, more and more couples come from different countries. More and more children therefore have roots in more than just one country. That's when problems can arise if couples divorce. Unfortunately, increasingly, this can lead to the child being abducted to the other parent's home country instead of the parents agreeing on custody of the child. The number of such international cases of child abduction has been steadily increasing. According to statistics, there are around 1 000 cases a year in the EU, if not more. The Hague Child Abduction Convention is therefore important because it provides legal and operational means of resolving cases of child abduction. The accession of new states to the Child Abduction Convention means that in future there will be permanent arrangements between EU Member States and these third countries to resolve cases of child abduction. The main principle of the Agreement is that the competent authorities of the States take immediate action to return the child to the State of residence. Only after the child is in his or her country of residence will the court go to court to deal with parental disputes, such as the question of custody. In this way, the Child Abduction Convention is also likely to prevent cross-border child abduction. But ratification alone will not solve child abductions. However, accession alone or formal ratification alone will not solve the issue. Each Contracting State shall define a central authority to coordinate the resolution of child abduction cases in the state concerned and to guide the implementation of the Agreement. The effective application of the Agreement requires the development of central authority activities and close cooperation between the authorities. But the EU can contribute to how cooperation on these issues starts. For its part, the Commission could examine whether there are development needs in the legislation or functioning and capacity of the new State which acceded to the agreement. The specific needs of each country must be taken into account, especially in the case of so-called developing countries. Finally, I would like to say that the entry into force of the Child Abduction Convention between the EU and the new States Parties requires that, after the European Parliament, the Council of Ministers approves the accession of the new states and that the Member States give their assent to this. I would ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of the reports tomorrow so that this agreement, which will improve children's rights in concrete terms, will also enter into force as soon as possible between the EU and these eight new States Parties.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 492, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, honourable Members, child abductions are another heart-breaking topic of today’s session here and I know that this matter is of special interest to many of you concerned by specific cases that desperate parents bring to your attention. Like you, I want justice to be served and, within the limits of my competences, children in the EU to be better protected.  The 1980 Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction is an important international legal instrument. Its aim is to provide a system of cooperation between the central authorities and a rapid procedure for the return of an abducted child to the country of the child’s habitual residence. Altogether, 93 countries, as Ms Hautala has said here, are already parties to this Convention. All EU Member States have joined the Child Abduction Convention. The EU is not a party to the Convention but has incorporated its principles in binding European legislation, which is the Brussels II Regulation. It is in the EU’s interest to maintain a common legal framework with third states in order to solve international child abduction cases and guarantee legal certainty and speedy proceedings for EU citizens involved in these kinds of sensitive disputes. In December 2011, taking the view that the question of the international abduction of children fell within the exclusive external competence of the EU, the Commission adopted proposals for accession acceptance for eight third-country states. Contrary to the Commission’s and Parliament’s views, within the Council most of the representatives of the Member States considered the Council to be under no legal obligation to adopt those proposals. As a result, the Council did not adopt the proposals.  Last October the European Court of Justice confirmed that the exclusive competence of the European Union encompasses the acceptance of the accession of a third state to the 1980 Hague Convention. It is now time to finalise this process without further delay. The Council needs to take a decision on each of the proposals in unanimity. The negotiations are quite challenging but we are dealing with serious matters of child protection. We therefore have a duty to find a solution to this. I will use my contacts with Member States to advance this process as much as possible. I would like to thank the rapporteur Ms Hautala and the Committee on Legal Affairs (JURI) for their constant support for the Commission’s initiative. We share the same determination to protect children and resolve abduction cases quickly.

Colleagues, i would like to thank you for your excellent work. How many times do we hear that the best interests of the child are the highest law, that we must do everything we can to ensure that our youngest generation, that is, our future, really, has the best possible living and development conditions. The brutality of everyday events shows that we still need to make new efforts to protect these children. With all the greater discomfort, I inform you that the two-year period of work on these reports is not our pride. The competence dispute took so long. Fortunately, it has been overcome, and today we can say that the next eight countries will accede to the Hague Convention, which we are pleased about, because it is an extremely important instrument governing relations between the Member States of the European Union and third countries in view of such an important problem as the abdument of children.  But we must remember one more thing: that all kinds of rules should be extremely simple and clear – so that everyone understands them. Moreover, they should also be flexible – so as to adapt them to the child's situation, so that it is always the best interests of the child that we talk about so often that is indeed the highest command for us and comes first.

However, I would just sound a note of warning because it is not quite as straightforward as that. We have some concerns over these eight countries, and the EU itself does not have any means of assessing how well these countries may do in the future. Some EU Member States have expressed concerns about that, including, I have to say, the UK. We have a real duty to look at this and to answer some of the questions raised, and we should continue to monitor what goes on. Children who have been abducted in cross-border situations should, of course, be given a higher standard of care and we must make sure that happens. We must also make sure that, wherever possible, they are reunited with their families. It is not acceptable for children who have already suffered a lot to go through further traumas and suffering, which could be avoided, when they are returned to their habitual country of residence. There is a lot here that needs to be thought about in terms of protecting children. That is why we must make sure that some of these eight countries, about which we have concerns, are monitored, that we keep in touch with what is going on, that reports are submitted to Parliament, and that the Commission really does follow up what is going on.

Since the statistics show an increasing trend in cases of child abduction abroad without the consent of the other parent, I consider it very important to support the accession of eight other non-EU countries to this document. This will only strengthen the use of this international instrument, to which more than 90 countries have already signed up, for the benefit of children. Their abduction cases are very complicated, emotional and mentally extremely challenging for children and their drivers.

Unfortunately, recourse to the national court does not provide adequate guarantees of the settlement of the crisis other than within a framework of judicial cooperation between different States. Outside relations between Eu ropean Union Member States, where the Brussels IIa Regulation applies, only the multilateral mechanisms provided for in the Hague Convention provide the legal instruments necessary for the return of the child.

Remarkable are the abductions of children by their own parents and their transfer to countries other than those of their place of residence.

The Hague Convention is important to prevent child abduction, but it is also important to bear in mind its very important Article 13, which states that even in the event of child abduction, if there is a serious risk that the return of a child would expose them to physical or psychological harm or otherwise put them in an unbearable situation, then these provisions must not be applied.

I would like very briefly to inform you about the latest news and development in this issue. We are now considering an additional six new accessions which are not included in the package of eight proposals. On 21 January, the Commission organised a meeting with the experts from the Member States in order to decide the approach to be adopted. I have to say that the Member States showed a very positive and collaborative attitude and this gives me hope that there will be smooth cooperation in this recurring exercise. The first step will be the gathering of information on the six new acceding countries so as to prepare the ground for the Commission proposals. The Latvian Presidency concluded that a unified EU approach is needed on this file as well as a set of minimum benchmarks to allow for a swift and pragmatic solution concerning the proposal under discussion. The discussions will continue at the next General Affairs Council meeting on 18 March 2015.  I would like to assure you of my determination to work to ensure that children are protected and their rights enforced. I count on your support and engagement in this common aim. I would also like to express my hope that you will support this proposal tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 526, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  Rapporteur. - (FI) Mr President, it is very pleasing to say that we will probably be adopting these eight identical reports almost unanimously tomorrow, and then we expect the Council to take swift action, and we trust Commissioner Jourová that this will actually happen. A couple of comments on the debate: Mr Lebreton indicated that, despite everything, it would be better for these issues to fall within the competence of the Member States in the EU. But let us consider it from the point of view that the Commission is still in a much better position to ensure that the legislation and operational capacity of the new state that acceded to the Convention are actually monitored on behalf of the Member States before accession is adopted. In other hand, I believe that, although these acceding countries may have a capacity gap and may sometimes have little lack of political desire, it is precisely the fact that this issue is undoubtedly a matter for the EU to deal with, that also gives the Commission an obligation to monitor how these other countries operate in this matter. Honeyball is no longer here, but we have just had a discussion with her that it is not so simple that when we here simply give our assent to these accessions on our own behalf, things will then move forward. Indeed, it is the case – as the honourable Members have said here – that Members of this House and Parliament must monitor how, on this important issue, which is often shocking to people's daily lives, namely child abduction, third countries are practically able to do the right thing. Finally, thank You For giving Mr McGuinnes a practical voice to this debate. He told us what the difficulties are, that an agreement is one thing and the other is how it works in practice.

This Hague Convention is important in that it establishes a framework within which participating States can cooperate in order to find solutions in cases of international child abduction. It also provides for the courts competent and what applicable law when deciding on the child's place of residence. Most importantly, it is this Convention that provides for the prompt return of abducted children to their country of residence. In most cases, these problems occur when the couple divorced. If the mother and father come from different countries, there is a desire to take advantage of the lack of cooperation between these states in order to secure custody of the child. In these cases, the national bias of the legal systems of individual countries is the biggest problem. Often, the courts of both states recognise themselves as competent to hear the case and each child is cared for by a parent who is a national of their state. This area falls within the exclusive external competence of the EU. Member States therefore no longer have the right to act on their own initiative.

This is regulated by the 1980 Hague Convention. Today, the European Parliament is making decisions on the accession of as many as 8 new States to this Convention. I think there should n't even be any doubt. The more countries adopt international standards on this issue, the better it will be for children. After all, family is one of the fundamental values of society, and the institutions should protect it also through legal means, especially in protecting the best interests of children. According to the latest Eurostat data, as many as 140 000 families of different nationalities stand out in the European Union each year. It is increasingly the case that former spouses settle in different countries, including outside the European Union, and children are abducted by a parent. For this reason, the Hague Convention is an important tool for establishing a way of enabling States to cooperate in the resolution of kidnapping. The biggest problem in such cases is the attitude of the state's legal system. It often happens that the courts recognise the custody of a child to the father who holds the nationality of the country in which the court is located. The purpose of this Convention is to remedy such situations. The accession of 8 new countries to the Convention is a reason to be happy, because the point is that children are protected around the world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 531, "date": "2015-02-10.json", "name": "Tomáš ZDECHOVSKÝ", "mepid": "124713", "text": "  Writing. – In the last ten years, there have been more cases where a child is wrongfully transferred or abducted by a second parent to another state.
