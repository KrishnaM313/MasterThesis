This is a decision that I have taken into account, taking into account all the different requirements, including that of avoiding misuse of the amendments, but also that of ensuring a clear and explicit vote on the key points. I have thus decided, out of respect for the Members of this House, that I believe that they cannot be forced to take long hours of voting on amendments which they have not had the opportunity to examine and on which, if I have to judge by the majority recorded on Monday, the margin of error and the alea would be very high. Pursuant to Rule 206(1) of the Rules of Procedure, I therefore call on the TRAN Committee to meet as a matter of urgency, for example on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday morning, and to submit to the House the results of its work in good time so that we can vote at the next part-session in April I next week in Brussels. As provided for in Rule 175 of the Rules of Procedure, amendments or requests for split or separate votes, which at this stage do not receive a vote in favour by at least one third of the members of the committee, will not be put to the vote in plenary. Furthermore, no further amendments or requests for separate or split votes may be tabled. I am confident that the TRAN Committee will be up to the task assigned to it.  I would also like to inform the House that, in the light of my decision to refer the matter back to the TRAN Committee to resolve the problem of amendments, the request made by a low threshold of Members under Rule 187 has become obsolete.

I would like to inform you of the decision taken, as provided for in the Rules of Procedure, after listening to and consulting the chairman of the TRAN Committee. The problem is the number of amendments and the number of requests for split votes. There are elements which may highlight filibustering, but there are also elements on the basis of which it appears that some of those amendments have important content, so it is not a filibustering action but a real intention to intervene in the text. In view of the complicated situation, in order to avoid voting four thousand times, it is better to accept the availability of the TRAN Committee and then, next week, if there are no solutions, we vote on all the amendments.

It was decided by a two-vote majority, if we show up again with three thousand votes in the Chamber we vote on things that no one knows. I have tried to amalgamation the amendments first: the ECR Group has asked for all the amendments to be voted on, and therefore against the merging, as is its right, into several requests for split votes. Staying here for hours and not knowing what to vote for is not right for this House, so, let us conclude, let us proceed to the debate, the TRAN Committee will do its job and we will see at the next session in April I in Brussels whether to vote and whether there will be a vote six thousand times, we will vote six thousand times!

The leaders agreed that a strong economic base is key to Europe’s prosperity and to our role on the world stage. Consequently, we have taken a number of initiatives. First, the European Council agreed that the single market should be further deepened and strengthened, with particular emphasis on the digital and service economy. Unjustified barriers must be removed, and new barriers must not be created. The Commission has been invited to develop, by March 2020, a long—term action plan for better implementation and enforcement of the single market rules. Second, we discussed how to address the challenges faced by European industry. Given its significance for millions of jobs in Europe, the Commission has been invited to present a vision of the EU’s industrial future, including concrete measures. Third, the EU needs to further develop its digital economy, with a special focus on data and artificial intelligence. In this context, we supported a concerted approach on the security of 5G networks. Yesterday, the Commission put forward a recommendation in this area. Last but not least, trade. The European Council will continue to promote an ambitious and balanced free trade agenda that ensures a level playing field. The leaders called to resume the discussion on the public procurement instrument, as well as to pursue rapid implementation of all the elements of the US-EU Joint Statement of 25 July 2018. We also discussed our economic relations with China. Apart from next month’s EU-China summit, there are also other meetings and summits with the Chinese leaders. Therefore, it was crucially important to agree a coordinated, European approach. We worked out a positive stance that offers ambitious cooperation on bilateral and global issues, including trade. We both have a key economic interest in maintaining significant trade flows, which are possible thanks to the rules-based trading system. However, for this system to continue to operate, it needs to be quickly updated. For the EU, this means serious reform of the WTO that would cover industrial subsidies, as a priority. We want to persuade China to address this, and I am convinced that we shouldn’t give up. As regards bilateral issues, we would like to finalise talks on the investment agreement already next year. We will discuss all of this with China at the upcoming summit. And, of course, I can’t imagine not having human rights on the agenda. I may be old—fashioned but I still think that human rights are at least as important as trade. (Applause) Additionally, leaders are determined to tackle climate change. Despite differences, it is clear how urgent the matter is, and the leaders will come back to this in June. In the meantime, we have instructed Ministers to step up work on the EU’s long—term climate strategy in order to implement the goals set down by the Paris Agreement. Turning to Brexit, as requested by Prime Minister May, the European Council decided to approve the so-called ‘Strasbourg Agreement’. Leaders also considered the UK’s request for a short extension of the Article 50 period. Our decision on extension envisages two scenarios. First, if the Withdrawal Agreement is passed by the House of Commons this week, the European Council agreed to a technical extension until 22 May. Second, if the Withdrawal Agreement is not approved by the House of Commons this week, the European Council agreed to an extension until 12 April, while expecting the United Kingdom to indicate a way forward. As I said after the European Council, 12 April is a key date in terms of the UK deciding whether to hold European Parliament elections. 12 April is the new cliff—edge date. Before that day, the UK still has a choice of a deal, no deal, a long extension or revoking Article 50. Here, let me make one personal remark to the Members of this Parliament. Before the European Council, I said that we should be open to a long extension if the UK wishes to rethink its Brexit strategy, which would of course mean the UK’s participation in the European Parliament elections. Then there were voices saying that this would be harmful or inconvenient to some of you. Let me be clear: such thinking is unacceptable. You cannot betray the six million people who signed the petition to revoke Article 50, the one million people who marched for a People’s Vote, or the increasing majority of people who want to remain in the European Union. They may feel that they are not sufficiently represented by the UK Parliament, but they must feel that they are represented by you in this Chamber because they are Europeans.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we have before us a week full of events, which does not encourage me to comment on what happens next. I will not go back to last week's European Council, whose President has just elegantly presented all the conclusions. We have talked a lot about China, which has been less complicated than the debates on Britain. I was telling some of you that Britain is an enigma that would make the sphinx look like a breeze. We will see this week how things will develop.  As I said, we talked a lot about China. On 12 March, the Commission presented a \"Chinese\" strategy. The reception of this document was favourable. No head of state or government has spoken out against the general lines of this strategy, which we have submitted to the meditation of the European Council.  Mrs Merkel and I had the opportunity yesterday, at the invitation of President Macron, to meet the Chinese President. We have been very clear: we want to make it clear, in Europe as in China, that we are strategic partners, competitors and rivals. I have noticed in some interviews that our Chinese friends do not like the word \"rival.\" But it's a compliment! We are rivals and competitors. Therefore, it is a question of ensuring that Europe does not appear as a europe offered, but as an open Europe, which has the immediate consequence that we claim the right for European companies to operate under normal competitive conditions in China, just as China can submit its proposals to the Europeans without any limitation. We respect China, but we also want China to respect us and our trade relations to be based on total reciprocity. What is most urgent now is to quickly find an investment agreement.

The decision of the Council was a good decision. First of all because the principle was included that there is no prolongation without the clarification that we need from our British friends – more clarity about what they want to achieve. We also created certainty for the 440 million Europeans on the question of the European elections, i.e. legal certainty or political certainty.  I want to pick up on your general remark about those who are fighting for a second referendum, those who are fighting for staying inside of the European Union. We are on their side; we want them to be successful and wish them all the best, but for the moment we still have the situation that Great Britain wants to leave the European Union. That’s the legal situation at the moment. Having this in mind, it’s also important to explain to our citizens why a country which is leaving the European Union should have a major say in the future of European Union. So that is also one of the questions on the table which we have to answer to our citizens. That’s why the Council’s decision to ask for clarity and for no prolongation without clarification was a good step, and we wish now to all our friends in the House of Commons good luck. Hopefully they can manage it in a better way than the government did in the last month. The options are on the table. The options are clear, clearly described, and they have to choose now, so let’s see.  The second thing is about economy, and there I want to share with you that we, as the EPP, fully support the principles of strengthening our economy, investing in the single market, investing in trade and investing in innovation. There is no doubt about this. The priority is the Chinese question, which is on the table in the ongoing discussions about and preparations for the summit, and I’m really grateful that we all share the same basic starting point. That means that the cooperation with China must be based on principles, on values – on what we believe in. There is a competition going on, on the political systems, on the way we think as a society, on how we organise a society, and on what are the basic values of a society. That’s why that must always be the starting point for our dialogue with China.  The second thing we as EPP believe in is a pragmatic approach on climate change. China is still committed to the Paris Agreement, so they are on our side. On the free trade principle, China is a partner for us; they are committed to free trade. So that’s why we share a pragmatic approach towards a Chinese relationship.  But the third point is also important: we shouldn’t be naive, and that means defining and protecting our key industries in the European Union. We also think, as the EPP, that we have to rethink our competition law in today’s European Union. Establishing, for the future, some kind of European ‘champions’ to adapt to the global dimension of competition in our legislation is also key issue. Ich möchte noch eine letzte Frage ansprechen, nämlich die Frage der Grundrechte in der Europäischen Union. Herr Präsident, sehr geehrter Herr Tusk, wir haben seit einigen Monaten jetzt die Artikel-7-Fragen mit Polen und Ungarn auf dem Tisch liegen, vom Parlament und von der Kommission angestoßen. Bisher gab es keine Gelegenheit, im Rat über diese Vorgänge zu reden. Ich bedauere es sehr, dass dazu bisher keine Gelegenheit war. In meiner Partei – das haben Sie vielleicht, das haben viele mitbekommen – hatten wir sehr intensive Debatten über diese Frage. Wir haben entschieden, Fidesz, die ungarische Regierungspartei, zu suspendieren, ihr alle Mitgliedsrechte in der EVP zu entziehen und damit das Signal zu setzen, dass es nicht unser Weg ist, der in Ungarn gegangen wird. Wir haben auch den Artikel 7 hier im Parlament als EVP mehrheitlich unterstützt. Und deswegen hätte ich schon die Bitte, dass endlich mal auch im Rat über diese Fragen gesprochen wird, dass das endlich mal thematisiert wird – öffentlich! Dass sich Staats- und Regierungschefs gegenseitig attackieren, ist das eine, aber sich an einen Tisch zu setzen und mal intern offen darüber zu reden, ist das andere. Deswegen hätte ich die Bitte, dass das gemacht wird. Genauso, wie wir uns als Parteien darum kümmern – die Liberalen, die Sozialdemokraten mit den rumänischen Freunden und so weiter, wir in der EVP mit unseren Fragen –, das ist der richtige Ansatz, dass wir uns den Themen zuwenden und auch Entscheidungen fällen, wenn es denn notwendig ist. Ich würde mir wünschen, dass wir darüber hinaus auch einen weiteren Schritt gehen. Wir erleben beim Artikel 7, dass er eben nicht wirkmächtig ist, dass er nicht zu schnellen Ergebnissen führt, was wir uns alle wünschen. Und deswegen würde ich mir wünschen, dass wir jetzt den nächsten Schritt gehen, nämlich einen verbindlichen Rule-of-law-Mechanismus der Europäischen Union installieren, so wie es dieses Haus bereits vorgeschlagen hat – viele Kollegen haben daran gearbeitet –, dass wir einen verbindlichen Mechanismus aufbauen, der Unabhängigkeit bei der Bewertung sicherstellt, der sicherstellt, dass regelmäßig – vielleicht jährlich – ein Bericht vorgelegt wird, und der sicherstellt, dass nicht nur mittel- und osteuropäische Staaten geprüft werden, sondern die gesamte Europäische Union bei den Grundrechten in den Fokus genommen wird. Wir brauchen dann ein quasi automatisches Verfahren, dass die Abweichungen dem EuGH vorgelegt werden. Und ich würde auch für diesen Mechanismus vorschlagen, dass zukünftig klargestellt wird, dass er sanktionsbewehrt ist, sprich die Fonds auch dafür verwendet werden, um die Rechte Europas durchzusetzen. Wir können mit China nur überzeugend in den Wettbewerb der Systeme treten, in den überzeugenden Wettbewerb der Grundrechte treten, wenn wir das im Inneren der Europäischen Union mit Leben erfüllen und diese Werte in die Zukunft führen. Und deswegen, Herr Ratspräsident, sehr geehrter Herr Tusk: Ich hätte die Bitte, dieses Thema jetzt endlich mal auf die Tagesordnung des Europäischen Rates zu nehmen, dass über die Fälle, die wir in Europa haben, auch dort gesprochen wird.

Two days. President Tusk, it was right that the European Council took precautions in this situation and pulled the strings to prevent the worst. But let me ask you today, two days before the original deadline for leaving. I address the Brexiteers: when do you have the decency to apologise to the British people for all that you have done to them over the last two years? When do you have the decency to explain yourself that you don't know what you're doing ... (Applause) ... that with lies and with all sorts of insinuations you have created a situation from which you know no way out, where you know exactly where: the economic product will collapse by ten percent, and you are lying to the people, and you do not know what to do next. Get back control of your stability, get back control of your lies, and apologise to the British people for what you did during the last years. This is my main message today. Many thanks to President Tusk, many thanks for what you did in defence of European citizenship. This was a very honourable move, and this is what has to be said here. Yes, we are Europeans, and no one should deceive the British people for their ability to continue to participate in shaping Europe until an exit has taken place. I am pretty well convinced. If the government is not able to deliver, if the situation remains blocked, then there is only one chance: ask the people. Ask the people. Yes, I know why you shy away from that. It is because you are afraid of everything happening on London's streets. Afraid to death because you can't stand it anymore. This will be the solution and the British people will tell you where to go. They, and nobody else, are the real sovereigns in this situation. Let me say: I believe that, of course, developments in the United Kingdom overshadow much of what we urgently need to regulate. I believe that the next summit on 9 May will have to deal with the great need to restart the economic upheaval in Europe. There must be a departure into a sustainable economy, an economy that protects the planet, secures its resources and offers all people a fair chance of participation. That will have to be our agenda. And only if we are self-confident, only if we are strong, will we also manage the situation with China. Realistically, this means: yes, we have a very strong partner, which we must not, of course, overlook or leave behind. But without self-confidence, without a unified, clear, self-confident line, the European model will be incompatible. We will be involved in this, and my group stands for it.

The good news is that the Council has managed to set out a clear timetable, and that was accepted by the United Kingdom, and hopefully the solution will be found within the timetable. But let us leave Britain to the Brits. My concern is the European Union.  The bad news is that the EU still seems to continue pursuing the same policy of deterrence, which roughly speaking consist of two elements. First, to punish the United Kingdom by a no deal, so that no one in the future would dare to follow in their footsteps. And secondly, to humiliate the United Kingdom by inducing them to undo Brexit by organising, for instance, another referendum. They’re using the argument that it was a very small majority that decided about Brexit. Well, if it had been the other way round – if the remainers have won by the same small majority – their verdict would have been considered here in this Chamber as absolutely irrevocable and binding for eternity. (Applause from certain quarters)  Not to mention the fact that organising referenda until one gets the results one wants is a peculiar contribution of the European Union to the theory and practice of democracy.  (Applause from certain quarters) So this is foul play. But the bad news is also the tone of self-congratulation which we have heard today. This is not a time for self-congratulation; this is a time for self-appraisal. President Juncker, President Tusk, let us admit it: this has been the most crisis-ridden period in the entire history of European integration. Brexit is one of several crises, and all of you who have taken the major decisions in the European Union are responsible for it – do not delude yourselves. A great share of responsibility is with you, gentlemen, and ladies too. President Macron recently wrote a letter to everybody in Europe, and he proposed more of the same – more centralisation. The funny part of it is that he called it a ‘European renaissance’. Apparently, he does not understand the meaning of the words he is using – ‘European twilight’ would probably have been a more adequate term. (Laughter and applause from certain quarters) Of course, the Brexit clock is ticking and we are all aware of it. We await progress in London, and hopefully this will happen. But we should also be prepared for any outcome and we should be ready to offer any help that we can. This is our problem too, whatever the outcome, and we should be friendly to the decision of the British people – whichever way they go. But the clock is also ticking for the European Union, ladies and gentlemen, and you should be listening to voters across Europe. There are more and more voters desperate for change, and change will happen.

We have far too much respect for such a great nation as Britain to do that.  (Applause) You know what the problem is? The problem of humiliation and punishment is because of the mess in the Tory party. There is the humiliation of the British people, sitting in your group.  (Applause) They are not even there. The only one there is Mr Farage. This is a surprise for me because I thought that he was marching somewhere in Britain, and he is here. A 200—mile march. How many miles have you done? Two miles, you think, something like that? I think so. You remind me more and more – I don’t know if you know him – of Field Marshal Haig in Blackadder. Do you know Field Marshal Haig in Blackadder? In the First World War he was sitting in his office in London, and you are sitting here in Strasbourg when your own people are marching in the rain and in the cold. That is the way you are taking your responsibility.  I want to recall the words of Winston Churchill, who said, if I may quote him: ‘Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm’. I think that quote from Winston Churchill is absolutely applicable today to British politics in the House of Commons and Prime Minister May: this afternoon, in the House of Commons – if the Speaker allows it, because that’s their system – there will be no less than 16 options on the table for a Brexit. So there is certainly no loss of enthusiasm, as in the quote from Winston Churchill.   But, more seriously, after all the negative voting of the last two weeks in the House of Commons – against the deal, against the no deal, against the second referendum, and so on – I think there may be light at the end of the tunnel now. With the approval of the Letwin amendment, there will be for the first time – after two years of negotiation – maybe a solution based on cross-party cooperation between Labour and the Conservatives. I believe that such an existential issue as Brexit can only be decided on with a cross—party agreement in parliament, as we do here in this European Parliament. (Applause)  I hope that the way forward, giving them time until 11 April, will see a majority in the House of Commons for one of these options between remainers and reasonable Brexiteers, because it’s between them that they have to find a way forward. In my personal opinion, I’m not counting on the hard Brexiteers, because for the hard Brexiteers it’s not the interest of the country which is important, but the power struggle inside the Conservative Party, as we have seen in the last days. I repeat in that respect – and I think that I can say this, Mr President, in the name of the whole European Parliament – that we are open to having this agreement with Britain, and that we are open to change the political declaration in two senses. First of all, in that we can make it more binding for both parties than only a declaration. Secondly, in that we can put inside this political declaration a far more intense relationship between the EU and the UK than the relationship that is foreseen in the political declaration at this moment. I think that this deep relationship – to respond to your last intervention, President Tusk – will also in some way be the seed for the future. I’m pretty sure that, not now – I’m an optimist, but not as optimistic as you – but within a few generations, there will be the return of Britain into the family of European nations. That’s Britain’s place, to be inside the European Union, not outside the European Union. (Applause) But it will not be succeeded now. It will be succeeded later on, and the seed is there – let’s be honest – in the march by one million people in London and the petition by six million people a few days ago.  Finally, my last point, on citizens’ rights: Mr Barnier and Mr Juncker, I know there has been a unilateral commitment by Britain to respect these citizens, as described in the Withdrawal Agreement. There is also, from you to Mr Barclay, a unilateral commitment to do exactly the same for the UK citizens living on the continent. Well, I think it’s now time to look into the possibilities, together with Mr Barclay, you and both Houses, to see how we can formalise that as fast as possible so that in any case, whatever happens – even when the most stupid thing happens, for example a no deal – at least these citizens are not the victims of all these games that we have seen in the last two years.

What a tragedy. So many issues we should be working on together utterly distracted by a self-inflicted disaster, entirely because the UK still – even now at this last hour – hasn’t made a decision on what it actually wants. Ms May triggered Article 50 without a plan, and they still cannot find consensus. We see MPs today at Westminster finally trying to reach a settled view. Good. Welcome to the party. In the Scottish Parliament, we’re debating revoking Article 50, because from a Scottish perspective – and every single party in Scotland, except the Conservatives, are united around this view – the best Brexit is no Brexit.  (Applause) So, colleagues, please don’t close the doors on us now. There are a lot of us in Scotland and elsewhere across the UK working hard to turn this round, to serve our citizens, to remain within this family of nations. But, in what might be my last speech in this place after 15 years serving our European people, we don’t know what’s in the UK’s future. We don’t know what’s in any of our future, and the forces of populism are gathering in all of our nations. We don’t know what’s in the UK’s future, but I do know that Scotland is a European nation. We celebrate international solidarity. We celebrate freedom of movement. If the European Union didn’t exist we would need to invent something like it, and Scotland would want to be part of it.  (Applause) You, as professionals, must deal with the United Kingdom as you find it. You must respect the UK’s constitution, and I respect that. You must deal with the interlocutors you’re dealt. Sorry about that, but you must deal with them. But, if we in Scotland are removed from our family of nations against our will – against our clearly democratically expressed view – independence will be our only route back.

(Applause) ...who then went on in 1918 to lead Britain in its greatest ever military feat, defeating Imperial Germany on the Western Front. Far from mocking Haig, as a Belgian, he should be a great hero to you. But never mind. Maybe that sums up your anti-Britishness. Sticking with Belgium, I thought what happened at the summit last week was a national humiliation, an impasse, because we have in Ms May a Prime Minister who hasn’t got the courage, who hasn’t got the vision, to carry out her many repeated promises: to take us out of the European Union this Friday, 29 March. It is not happening, and we are witnessing a slow motion betrayal – perhaps the greatest betrayal of any democratic vote in the history of our nation – and the reason, of course, is this Withdrawal Treaty. And I’ll go back to the First World War: we won the war, but we had the Treaty of Versailles, and this Treaty is the modern—day equivalent. We have a reparations bill of GBP 39 billion we have to pay for nothing in return. We have the annexation of a part of our national territory in the shape of Northern Ireland. This Treaty is a bad piece. It is unacceptable, it is not Brexit, and it will not pass.  I know that you’re all getting terribly excited about what the House of Commons may do over the course of the next week, and we know what they’ll do: they’ll come back with some form of agreement around a customs union and the continued free movement of people. But even if they do that, the one thing that’s inevitable is that we’re headed for an Article 50 extension. And I think you should ask yourselves: do you really want that? Do you really want Brexit to utterly dominate the next couple of years of your business, to the exclusion of your many other ambitions? Do you really want the United Kingdom to contest the European elections – to send back a very large number of Leave MEPs, just at a time when you’re fighting populism, as you see it, across the continent? Do you really want me back in this place?  (Mixed reactions) Well there we are. And all for what? Because Brexit is going to happen anyway. Mr Tusk, if you think the British people have changed their minds on Brexit, you, sir, are deluded: what we actually now see are opinion poll leads of 15%, and in some cases nearly 20%, in favour of leaving. If we had another referendum, Leave would win it by a bigger margin, so why put yourselves through years of agony?  I pay great tribute to Mr Juncker, to Mr Barnier, and to the Commission. You have prepared your no-deal scenario. It is highly professional. It shows that actually leaving with no deal is not going to cause huge disruption – it even suggests that with no deal there’s no need for a visible border in Ireland. So I would say to all of you, and to the national leaders: reject the British extension beyond 12 April, get Britain out, and then we can all just get on with the rest of our lives.

After two years of negotiation, our Prime Minister has concluded a draft withdrawal agreement that has twice suffered historic defeats in the House of Commons – a draft withdrawal agreement that would see Northern Ireland leaving on different terms to the rest of the United Kingdom under the backstop; an agreement from which the Attorney General advises that there is no legal right of withdrawal. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) wants to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion, but this deal will endanger the constitutional and economic integrity of the United Kingdom. It is not a price that we, as Unionists, are willing to pay.  Finally, some advice to Mr Tusk and Mr Bullmann: 17.4 million British voters signalled their desire to leave the European Union.

Monday’s vote in the House of Commons gave a glimmer of hope for a way out of this incredible deadlock. The UK Parliament decided to step in and take back control of the Brexit process. We now need to see what they do with this control. We have always said that the Political Declaration can be reviewed to pave the way for a closer relationship between the EU and the UK. We can do this quickly, and this is not only possible but is something we would welcome. On the contrary, if the House of Commons does not provide a clear cross—party majority for a customs union or the single market nor adopts the current deal, then serious choices must be made. If the UK decides to ask for a long extension, of course this cannot be to renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement, which is closed and will not be re-opened. But if the UK asks for a longer extension to rethink Brexit to offer a closer relationship or to provide for election or a referendum then, of course, we will support it. President Tusk, our group has always been clear on this, because we have the sense of historical proportions. Guy, you said you want them back but not now. We have always respected the referendum. But if the UK does not leave we shall celebrate and we will never do anything to prevent this possibility from happening now.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 19, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "James NICHOLSON", "mepid": "1318", "text": "   – Madam President, I said at the beginning of this that it would go down to the wire and beyond.

And I also have to say that the backstop would unravel the fabric of the Belfast Agreement, an international agreement which many in this place champion, but they wilfully forget the principle of consent within that agreement.  There’s a need to listen to everyone in Northern Ireland, not just those who shout the loudest. There’s a very quiet majority of people in Northern Ireland who also want a good way forward for Northern Ireland, for the United Kingdom, and indeed for the European Union. I think we’ve got to move away from positions of the past and find a better future to which we can all work within. I am still concerned, Madam President, that we are still in danger of crashing out. Nobody’s fault – not Mr Tusk’s fault, not Mr Barnier’s fault, not anybody’s fault – but there’s a danger of a crashing—out, and I hope Mr Tusk will ensure that that does not happen. I listened to him with interest, and I say to him: he needs a firm hand. Can I indulge once more, Madam President, for this could well be – like my colleagues from Scotland – my last speech after 30 years in this Parliament. It’s been quite a long time; I’ve enjoyed it and all the people I have worked with through that time.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at the end of this important debate, we have listened, together with President Juncker and Vice-President Katainen, to each and every one of you with great care. Let me say a few words, thanking you, Mr President. On Thursday, at the invitation of President Donald Tusk, whom I personally thank, I once again took part and attended the debates of the European Council, which is being discussed this morning, and I can testify once again on this extraordinary Brexit-related negotiation of the gravity and responsibility that is that of each and every European leader around this table. , and in the serious, responsible, objective way with which they decide and they are working on this negotiation. It is now almost two years since the task of conducting this negotiation was entrusted to me by President Juncker and President Tusk, with the confidence of Parliament. For the past two years, ladies and gentlemen, and I want to say this today, I have, like you - and this has been Parliament's main point of vigilance, considering that the issue of the security of citizens' rights should be our priority, as Guy Verhofstadt, Manfred Weber, Roberto Gualtieri, Udo Bullmann and Gabriele Zimmer have said in turn earlier. , and others.  As President Tusk has said, the priority will remain the security of citizens' rights, those some 4.5 million people, 3.5 million European citizens who live and work in the United Kingdom and who participate, Mr Farage, in the economy of your country, and 1.5 million British citizens who live and work in one of our countries. This security of citizens' rights will remain, Mr Verhofstadt, our priority, whether in the hope of an agreement that we expect, but also in the event of a no deal, which we do not want but to which we are preparing. And we will find a way to guarantee those rights. For the past two years, we have been working with the same respect for the United Kingdom. I have admiration for your country, ladies and gentlemen, as I have often said here. For its history, for its culture, for a number of men and women who have led it in history, but also for the solidarity that has been yours in the most serious hours, in the twentieth century, towards us. So it is with this respect that we work. And in this notion of respect, Mr Farage, I obviously include respect for the sovereign decision of a majority of British citizens. We respect this decision, even if we regret it, and we implement it patiently, rigorously, conscientiously, methodically for the past two years, that is what we have been doing. Mr Farage, no one in Brussels is trying to steal Brexit and want to hijack the vote of the British people. But it is not in Brussels that we make the choice to leave the European Union, it is you who make this choice and it is you who must take responsibility and face the consequences of these decisions, no one else. So, for the last two years, we have been implementing the decision, with this respect, and I want to say to Mr Legutko, who is not here to listen to me, that at no time in the last two years, at no second, there has been any trace of the will of humiliation or revenge on the United Kingdom, quite the contrary. For the past two years, I have been saying this to President McGuinness, who was president earlier, but also to Sean Kelly, to Mr Nicholson, whom I always listen to with attention, to Mrs Anderson or to Mrs Dodds, we have been patiently looking for concrete and operational solutions to the most serious problem created by Brexit, which is obviously in Ireland, and the risk to the peace and stability of this island, to which we have contributed for 20 years. , since the Good Friday agreement, this is what we are doing, nothing else. Mr Nicholson, just a few words in the case of a no deal. In all scenarios, the Good Friday Agreement will continue to apply. The United Kingdom will remain a co-guarantor of that agreement and is expected to uphold it in spirit and in letter. The Commission is ready to make additional resources available to Ireland - technical and financial - to address any additional challenges. Compliance with the Good Friday agreement will therefore remain the line to avoid a hard border, but of course there will have to be checks somewhere in one way or another, because it is the respect of the internal market, that is to say our internal market, but also respect for the British internal market, Mr Farage.  For the past two years, we have been working on this negotiation, which remains a negative negotiation. It there is no added value to Brexit. No one, not even Mr Farage, has been able to show me the added value of Brexit. No one! It's a negative, lose-lose negotiation! We must therefore intelligently find an agreement to limit the consequences of this negotiation. Then, somehow, end it as soon as possible because, as Mrs Rodriguez said earlier, there is a great deal to be done beyond and outside of Brexit on the positive agenda that President Tusk has mentioned and which President Katainen will discuss later. That's what counts! In this positive agenda, beyond the divorce that we want as orderly as possible, I attach an important place to building a strong and lasting relationship with the United Kingdom, a great country that will in any case remain a friend, an ally and a partner. I would conclude by saying that the decision of the European Council was taken in good conscience, in order to deal with this sometimes unpredictable situation in the House of Commons. You must understand this decision as the will for the Europeans that the United Kingdom can now, in full sovereignty, make its own decisions and face its own responsibilities. It is up to the United Kingdom to choose, one way or another. And what was decided by the European Council, with this double deadline decision in April and then in May, is precisely the possibility for the United Kingdom to take its responsibilities. It is now up to him, who wants to leave, to choose his future and finally to accept the consequences of his decisions.  Because this negotiation is not a trade negotiation, it is not a matter of haggling or making concessions on both sides. That has never been our mindset. This process is an exit process. The UK is leaving the European Union, wants to leave the single market, wants to leave the customs union, taking responsibility for it and assuming the consequences. Even if he can still stay, as President Tusk said, anything is possible until 11 April.  I mean that this choice has consequences and that the United Kingdom must assume them in full responsibility and sovereignty. It is this opportunity offered to him by the decision of the European Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 56, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Michel BARNIER", "mepid": "72776", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, even though the debate has concentrated almost purely on the Brexit issue, I will not comment more on that, because our chief negotiator, Mr Barnier, has already explained everything relevant so elegantly.  I would like to comment on a couple of other points which were also part of the European Council agenda, namely industrial policy and especially the EU-China relations. Very briefly, on industrial policy, the Commission has already set up a working group. It’s kind of an expert group which has been working on the future of the industrial policy of Europe. The target is 2030 and this group has already been working more than a year. I am co-chairing it together with Commissioner Bieńkowska and we will come out with concrete proposals by the summer. So this paper is at the disposal of the next Commission and the next Parliament. The aim is to identify the most crucial points, how to modernise the European industry. Another very important topic is the EU-China relationship. We appreciate a lot that the Council paid attention to our proposals and endorsed many of our proposals because the EU and China are strategic partners and strategic partners usually do things together, not only speak together on the issues. This situation is currently a little bit problematic. We share many views with the Chinese authorities on various policy issues and we have also done some things together, but there are many issues which we have mostly been talking about, but not doing that much and this happens mostly in the field of economy.  China is a political superpower – a foreign policy superpower, a military superpower. It’s also a technological leader. It’s a business leader in many areas and that’s why there is no point to say that China is only a developing country. China for sure is a developing country in many respects, but taking into account its power in the world’s economy today we have all the reasons to expect reciprocity. This is what the EU is expecting from the Chinese side – a strategic partnership based on reciprocity, especially when we talk about market access policies.  The European Council also asked the Commission to come with concrete proposals on how to improve our business and economic relationship with China, and this is under our work at the moment. We are preparing, for instance, state aid rules to third country acquisitions. As everybody knows, we have very strict state aid rules when it comes to intra—EU acquisitions, but the same rules don’t apply with a third country, and this is problematic. We want to make sure that there is a level playing field, that there is hard competition, but not unfair competition. So we have to make sure that our single market is open for everybody, but is fair for everybody. We cannot allow unfair competition to happen or take place in Europe.  We also, like President Tusk said earlier, expect to finalise our investment agreement negotiations with China by 2020. This is of utmost importance. It will help Chinese and European investments to flourish. Also, we expect China to accept the geographical indications agreement, which has already been negotiated but unfortunately not approved yet. Honourable Members, as I said, we are strategic partners. We work very closely in many political areas, but economic cooperation is one of the particular areas where improvements are needed in order to maintain a level playing field and in order to allow European companies to do the same things in China as Chinese companies are doing in Europe.

It will be in an informal meeting, but also dedicated to absolutely crucial topics. Mr Farage, you have presented passionate arguments against the second referendum. But the truth is that the second referendum took place in 2016, because the first one took place in 1975. Then, a vast majority of the British public decided that the place of the UK was in the European Communities.

Yet Westminster has treated the views of Scotland with contempt. The Scottish Government has continuously argued that the aggressive hard Brexit or bad deal position favoured by the UK Government has been wrong—headed, but the UK’s devolved administrations have been ignored throughout. Westminster today is debating various alternatives to Theresa May’s reckless strategy. May is in office but not in power. SNP MPs will support an amendment that will see a series of indicative votes on Brexit next steps, including the option to revoke the Article 50 application.

The common stage has taken place in very challenging circumstances. Compromises have been built. Some believe that the compromise is too much, that there is too much strong regulation, and for others there is too little regulation, that is, even tougher rules of the game are needed. The compromise rarely makes everyone come out victorious. Unfortunately, we are not children in the candy trade; It has been interesting to follow the debate on how it has been claimed that we do not have a compromise that can be voted on. Yes, we do, but obviously it seems that it is too difficult for many parties to swallow up, that the rules of the game in European transport would be such that drivers would no longer be exploited there and that we would not have these letterbox companies running a business that does not comply with the Business Code in accordance with European rules of the game. We had a big premise that we would stop nomading. Drivers have the right to be home to their family or to a place of their choice at regular intervals. This compromise, drawn up together, includes a genuine end to nomading and the right for drivers to return to their place of dom or to a place agreed with the company or employer. There was an idea of equal pay for equal work. To a very large extent, we have come to the common conclusion that equal pay is paid for equal work in the transport sector. That doesn't seem to be enough either. For the directives sent, some want a model in which everything is sent from day one. Of course, it has its own social aspects that can certainly be justified, but it also takes away the flexibility to operate according to the rules of the game, so that vehicles are not empty or half empty either when they are transported back and forth on Europe's roads. Letterbox companies – clear rules of the game for abolishing them and the shutdown of illegal cabotage, and then for crosstrade operations not to be used as a new form of illegal cabotage. For the first time, we would put the obligation in check and order: enforcement rules as a common entity for the whole package, as well as electric tachographs, and overall monitoring on the road afterwards would be possible with these plotters. There is a compromise. All sorts of work is being done here to prevent a vote on the compromise.

Mr President, in line with Mrs Kyllönen, I can confirm that the Mobility Package I is an integrated package of secondment, cabotage and driving and rest periods. We have all noticed in recent weeks and days that it is a politically difficult issue that goes to the heart of the European Union's internal market.  In my file driving and rest periods are about improving the working conditions of the drivers. This is not so much about the daily working hours and rest hours, which is arranged in another file. We're not going to get that. It is mainly about the rest periods at night and on weekends. The most important question is where does a driver spend that weekend rest. We have seen that there is currently illegal parking on many European roads. There's no sanitation there. There's no kitchen there. That is what we are trying to resolve with this dossier and the European Commission's proposal. In this respect, we are being controlled and obstructed by the European Court in Luxembourg. This has stipulated that the regular weekend rest may no longer be spent in the cabin. We have tried to find a solution to this by banning it, but with a decent transitional period.  Another element in this file is when the driver goes home. We don't want nomad drivers who have been away from home for more than four weeks. They must go home on time and their employer must guarantee this, up to four weeks at a time.  The short weekend rest remains: it can be spent in the secure and well-equipped parking spaces.  A special part of this file is the bus drivers. You know, Madam President, passengers are not containers. For the bus drivers we need a little more flexibility. Not 16 hours of work, as some members of the S&amp;D Group claim, but a little more flexibility, especially when it comes to the so-called 12-day scheme.  Mr President, an important part of this dossier and the other two is enforcement. Mrs Kyllönen has already spoken about this and it is all about introducing the so-called smart tachograph second generation on 1 January 2024. In addition, the problem of post office companies is indeed at stake, a phenomenon that we must tackle and combat at all costs.  Mr President, finally, something about cabotage and secondment. We must be careful not to tackle or impede the flexibility of the internal market with too stringent legislation. We currently have a large driver shortage of more than 50 000 people in Europe and it is important that this driver shortage is resolved with flexibility and with good working conditions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 75, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Ismail ERTUG", "mepid": "96842", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report and for the way in which she has been rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all, I would like to take up what the two previous speakers have said, namely the fact that we do now have a situation on European motorways that is largely unsustainable. It is no longer acceptable for the countries and for the regions that can no longer cope with this in terms of infrastructure, but also for those who have to do their work on the streets every day – far from their homeland and away from their families.  This, of course, also contributes to the fact that this profession is no longer so lucrative, so interesting. It's not always about money. If you look at the average income of drivers in south-eastern Europe in particular, they are above average. But there is still a shortage of drivers there. So it cannot be down to money alone. This has to do with the fact that the conditions are bad, that the conditions are bad. If you're on the road for three months and then you're at home for a month and then you're on the road for almost three months, then at some point you don't feel like the job.  That is why it was right for the European Commission to put forward this mobility package I. And, as my two fellow rapporteurs have rightly said, we want to design this sector in Europe in such a way that, firstly, we continue to maintain this internal market, that access is possible, but at the same time that, at the end of the day, the basis and the basis are taken away from the few who have built up their business models only through social dumping.  We have the situation that we voted here in Parliament last July and all three dossiers were rejected. And since almost a year has passed since then, ladies and gentlemen, we have, of course, dealt with the issue together. We have had cross-party discussions and have finally put forward compromises here. Of course, compromises are decisions that do not satisfy everyone. Yes, but that is why it is a compromise.  That is why it was a good thing that, after 3 December, when there was a general approach in the Council, so to speak, with a majority decision, we had the opportunity once again to set up and formulate solutions on this basis. We have brought them in. The fact that various points of order – I call them tricks, I am sorry – are now trying to undermine them, that is just the way it is.  But the fact is that this legislation is needed. We have hundreds of thousands of drivers waiting for it. We have companies that ultimately deal properly with their people, who are serious entrepreneurs, and they are also waiting for this legislation. What would happen if this legislation did not take place? Then we still have this wild-west state with many grey areas on the roads. We have the danger – and this has already been announced – that various Member States will take unilateral action, which in turn will also be called on the agenda by the European Commission in retrospect. That is why we are once again calling for support for this compromise.  What is in my dossier \"Access to the market and cabotage\"? We have tried precisely to eliminate the weaknesses of the current legislation, which pretend to allow three operations within seven days. We tried to put this on a new footing because it was simply not feasible to control all this with the security authorities. We have found a solution which is also supported by the Eastern European states.

The Mobility Package remains of course a political priority for the Commission, and for Commissioner Bulc in particular. However, she must participate in the informal Transport Council, which is taking place in Bucharest. In May 2017, when the Commission adopted the first part of the Mobility Package, it aimed first of all at improving working conditions in the road transport sector; secondly, at ensuring fair competition and avoiding internal market fragmentation through uncoordinated national rules; and, thirdly, at reducing the administrative burden for operators and allowing more efficient and targeted controls through further digitalisation. Since then, we have come a long way, and I would like to thank you for your efforts, and in particular the three rapporteurs, Ms Kyllönen, Mr van de Camp and Mr Ertug, who have been major driving forces in this process. From the beginning, we knew that this was going to be a marathon rather than a sprint. The stakes are very high on these proposals. That is why a long maturation period was unavoidable for these proposals to sink in and be improved. With the general approach reached in Council on 3 December 2018, and the work of the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs in this House, we are now close to a good compromise on this major reform of road transport. The road sector needs a breakthrough now. The hauliers and the drivers need a fair and stable framework for the next years. The sector cannot wait any longer.  A swift agreement in Parliament will show that this House is committed to address the pressing challenges this sector faces. The intense work of the Parliament has allowed us to reach rather uncontroversial solutions on important issues, such as the fight against letterbox companies; enhanced cooperation between national authorities; the better use of digital tools, such as tachographs, electronic freight documents and the notification of posting declarations; and proportionate rules for light commercial vehicles. Progress on these issues allowed Parliament to focus the last discussions on the main outstanding issues, namely the rules on cabotage, the driving and rest times, and last, but certainly not least, the lex specialis on the application of the posting rules in road transport.  In our view, the compromise proposals tabled strike a good balance and meet the general objectives of the Commission’s proposals: better enforcement, better working conditions, less administrative burden on road transport undertakings, and reaping the benefits of digitalisation. At this stage, the Commission maintains a general reserve, but it will continue to support discussions with a view to reaching an agreement on these priority files. We can support all amendments which maintain the balance between the freedom to provide transport services, improve working conditions and reduce administrative burdens. Let me now make a few considerations on particular points. I will start with the lex specialis on posting of workers. When the general Posting of Workers Directive was revised, there was a clear commitment to adopt specific rules for road transport. The so—called split model for the posting of directives, while being different from the approach proposed by the Commission, strikes a good balance between the protection of the social rights of drivers and the freedom for operators to provide cross-border transport services. It is supported by the rapporteur and contained in the general approach adopted by Council. Moreover, we support posting requirements for the road transport sector that are as simple as possible to apply and to control with the use of digital tools. We believe that the approach promoted by Ms Kyllönen meets these objectives. I turn now to the rules on driving and rest times. This is a sensitive subject, which has a direct impact on working conditions and road safety. In the Commission’s view, the driver must be able to take his normal and long weekly rest either at home with his family, or in comfortable accommodation – not in the truck cabin. At the same time, drivers also need to be granted suitable, safe and secure resting facilities. Therefore, ensuring the availability of such facilities is crucial. The Commission supports and actively promotes the development of safe and secure parking areas, including through financial support from the EU budget. I can assure you that the Commission will intensify its efforts, including through EU funding under the next Connecting Europe Facility. For passenger transport, the sector has received a clear message over the last weeks. Certain driving and rest time rules are not adapted to the activity of a coach or bus driver. The message has been heard, and we are ready to start immediately a comprehensive assessment on specific rules for these drivers, if this House so requests. For sure, our objective will remain the same: improving the working conditions of drivers and road safety. Let me finish on the rules on access to the profession and to the market. On cabotage, I am pleased that the rapporteur maintains the concept of an unlimited number of operations over a certain period of time, which was proposed by the Commission. Cabotage, the cooling—off period and the regular return of the truck to the Member State of establishment have been the subject of intense debates. We have to reach a balance here. The obligation for the trucks to return to the Member State of establishment should be assessed together with the additional establishment criteria, and also the new rule requiring drivers to return home on a regular basis. I look forward to the debate. Please carefully reflect on the links between the different areas of the Mobility Package. I would appeal to all to be constructive and to focus on solutions that work for the road haulage sector and its workers, and of course, for the European Union economy. This vote will be crucial for the work ahead of us.

The European Commission's proposals did not show any improvement, but completely divided the Member States between headquarters and periphery. They have proposed rules that, as it stands, are simply unenforceable. In the Council, against nine countries, the position was pushed through with one abstention. Now it's Parliament's turn. Everyone is talking about principles and European values, while one of the eu's cornerstones is the provision of free services and the single internal market can be damaged if we force decision-making. Without transport, there is no successful European economy, any disruption in transport will make production more expensive, and citizens will ultimately have to pay for it. We need to get back to the negotiating table and find a real compromise. And it takes time and composure, but both are missing.

We know that, in the case of long—distance, cross-border professional drivers, those conditions are overwhelmingly unhealthy, unsafe and undignified, with access to many of their social rights being deprived by shady employment and letterbox companies. Many drivers are expected to rest in their cabs, with no access to basic hygiene facilities, such as toilets and showers. But this isn’t just a question of rights; it’s a question road safety. When you look at the statistics, you’ll find the driver fatigue is a significant contributor to accidents in the majority of cases. So with that in mind, our party is wanting to see, as an absolute minimum, that we retain a two-week reference period that would not encourage an increase in nomadic driving.

Yes to the protection of workers; not to be used for other less dignified objectives.

All the elements of the negotiations are on the table now and it is time to vote.  The Mobility Package I, as tabled today, will improve road transport in the European Union. It will provide a level playing field for companies by having uniform rules, improved working conditions for drivers and enhanced control possibilities. It addresses many of the known problems in the sector today and, what is more, absence of new European rules will likely lead to a further deterioration of the situation in road haulage with wage and social dumping, fragmentation and protectionism all rising.  Let me give you examples. For companies the package will bring: a stable and predictable legal framework avoiding uncoordinated national rules, which risk fragmenting the single market; clear lists of documents to be provided and carried in trucks; clear establishment criteria eradicating the growing phenomenon of letterbox companies; a new cooling-off period to avoid the so-called systematic cabotage practices; the professionalisation of van operations with light commercial vehicles, which will be submitted to similar rules in international transport; and an agreed increased use of digital tools, reducing the administrative burden, for example for posting declarations.  For drivers the package will also bring important benefits: posting rules will apply to them with minimum wage and employment conditions of the host country; the regular return home or to another private place after a maximum of four weeks will be guaranteed; the conditions for regular weekly rests and obligations of employers to pay accommodation will be clarified; and better resting conditions will be ensured to avoid fatigue and prevent endangering road safety.  The package will finally provide for better enforcement with much earlier deployment of smart tachographs with geo-localisation to control posting and driving time; with reinforced administrative cooperation between national authorities; with the use of electronic freight documents to check cabotage rules; and with the use of digital tools to facilitate roadside checks.  Actually, we note that many among those important measures are in principle, largely consensual within your house. On all other outstanding points we strongly recommend support for the reports of the rapporteurs, which are striking the right balance.  I cannot stress enough the urgency of securing a positive outcome on the Mobility Package I ahead of the European elections. The state of the road market in the Union, the working conditions of our drivers and the environment in which our companies are operating are far too serious matters to be left at an unsatisfactory status quo for an as yet unknown period of time.

At a time when political transition continues to destabilise the south as Russia seeks to undermine those countries in the Eastern Partnership and as the enlargement agenda faces challenges in moving forward, the Neighbourhood has never been so important as it is today to the European Union.

Given the very strict geographic ring-fencing included within the instrument, however, I do not believe the consolidation will see funds diverted to one part of the Neighbourhood to the detriment of others.  As to the concerns that some had regarding the bringing together of development funds with more explicit foreign-policy tools, the requirement for 95% of funding to meet OECD official development aid benchmarks should reassure all of us. This is an increase on the 92% as proposed originally by the Commission. I also welcome the development of EFSD into the much more ambitious EFSD+ and a renewed external action guarantee.

Mr President, Vice-President Timmermans, Commissioner Vella, I want to start this evening with a flashback and go back in time with all those in this Chamber who were with me that evening, the night of 18-19 December last year. This trilogue - and I have led a few here in the twenty years I have been in the European Parliament - where the European Union has said no to single-use plastics. Twelve and a half hours of marathon negotiations with the Council to bring to light the most ambitious legislation. We had no choice but to be exemplary and take the lead in leading the battle.  I have had to speak dozens of times already in committee, in groups, in plenary, in hearings. I recalled the figures, the images, the tragic situation of our oceans in the world, but also at home in Europe. Plastic poisons our seas, kills their inhabitants and threatens us at the end of the chain. Urgent action was urgently needed, starting with the 10 single-use plastics and fishing equipment, which account for 70% of all marine waste.  We have every reason to be satisfied with this agreement reached that night with the Austrian Presidency. Several victories are to be noted. First, the extension of the list of single-use plastics that will be banned in two years (2021, it's tomorrow) to the original list of known prohibitions, namely plastic cutlery, plastic plates, cotton rods, sticks for balloons, touillettes. We convinced the Council to add oxdegradable plastics and food cups and containers made of expanded Polystyrene, the refrigerant. This addition represents 30% of plastic waste.  We also maintained, and it was not easy in the face of a reluctant Council, the producer's expanded liability regime. This polluter pays principle is now at the heart of our legislation. We have secured an obligation for tobacco manufacturers to fund the collection, clean-up and recycling of cigarette butts as early as January 2023. That's a year earlier than the other producers.  One more point and not least, we got to add a 25% recycled content target for plastic bottles. Bottles, I remind you, are the number one item on the podium in number of objects that pollute our beaches and oceans. 25% recycled content by 2025, 30% by 2030. It is a fuel for the circular economy.  For cigarette filters, cellulose acetate, plastic, therefore, the Council and the Commission have not taken up our reduction targets and I regret that. On the other hand, we have obtained mandatory marking on packages to warn about their environmental impact. Few citizens know this too: a single cigarette butt thrown into the ocean pollutes between 500 and 1,000 litres of water. For food cups and packaging, the text now specifies an ambitious and sustainable reduction for 2026. We wanted numerical targets, we did not achieve them at European level. This task is referred to the responsibility of the Member States. Therefore, I urge the Member States here, of course, and in this regard, to move faster on Article 4, as a whole series of Member States such as France and Austria are doing, through the very recent and very ambitious statements of Chancellor Kurz, but also certain regions such as Wallonia. Our legislation will save consumers 6.5 billion euros and create between 30,000 and 50,000 jobs in sectors where there is real know-how in Europe. It is considerable and everyone is aware of it. It is more, so much more, than the 'straws' directive to which we are sometimes reduced. But that is not enough, we will move forward again, and on three axes at least. An ambitious review of EU packaging legislation, with an numerical target on packaging reduction; a major action plan against microplastics, because these are the macroplastics that we have targeted here; and then a real shift from Europe to the circular economy with quality recycling channels. One last very important word for me: the result I present to you is very clearly a team effort. Parliament, Commission, Council, we have worked together, a sacred union in the service of an ambition.

It is also a concrete demonstration of the EU’s broader commitment to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. Never before has a natural environment that sustains humankind been under such strain. Never before has it been so important to put sustainable development at the very heart of everything we do in Europe and globally. The new Directive on single-use plastics will help change the way we design, consume and manage plastic products and waste. It will significantly reduce the negative impact of plastic pollution on the environment, in particular the marine environment. If we don’t change our ways now, we will choke our oceans with plastic. Scientific evidence is undeniable. So are the gravity and urgency of the problem. Europeans care about this and want Europe to show leadership in finding solutions and raising the standards across the globe. It was just as Ms Ries said just over a year ago when we announced in the European Plastics Strategy that we would come forward with a legislative proposal on single-use plastics. Today this House is about to take a final decision. The prospect of this new legislation has already boosted more sustainable business solutions, changed consumer behaviour and become a leading example in the world, even before its entry into force. A positive vote by the European Parliament will deliver a positive change in line with our shared circular economy in plastics strategy goals. It will stimulate innovation and investment in new products and promote new circular business models. The measures will also significantly reduce littering and plastic pollution in our marine waters. I really want to do a big shout out to Frédérique Ries and all her shadow rapporteurs for an incredible job. As she said just now, we worked on this together: three institutions, people on three sides, who all believed this could be done when people outside were saying it was almost impossible. So Frédérique and all the others, thank you very much for a great job.

Our main task now is to ensure that the ambitious measures enshrined in it are also quickly implemented in practice.  Prevention of plastic litter is a common task for public authorities, producers and consumers alike. All actors across the plastic value chain will have to work together. The agreed measures should improve the design of products, raise consumer awareness by labelling, and also reduce consumption by banning certain products for which more sustainable alternatives are available. The European Parliament also pushed for very strong measures to ensure that the bill for proper waste management and clean—up of litter is picked up by the producers, who have the greatest influence on improving collection of on—the—go consumption waste.  We will also have mandatory targets for recycled content in plastic bottles. This will truly change the very fundamentals of the plastics economy by giving a strong push for the secondary raw materials market. I should also mention that, while fully supporting the agreement reached in the interinstitutional negotiations, the Commission would like to make three declarations. Specifically, the no opinion clause as the rule of principle is that the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is delivered, and this right should not be withheld without justification. Secondly, on the very short timeframes envisaged for the adoption of Commission implementing acts, as the Commission is concerned about the feasibility to comply with these deadlines in time. Lastly, on the unnecessary inclusion of a definition of biodegradable plastic, because it does not have a direct impact on the directive implementation.  Clearly, we should all be very proud of these new rules because they tackle pollution from single—use plastics and fishing gear in such a comprehensive manner. Once implemented, it will not only prevent plastic pollution, but also make the European Union the world leader when it comes to the most sustainable plastic policy. The European Parliament has played a very major and essential role in laying the foundation for this transformation, and I sincerely hope that you will all give your support to make it happen.  Once again, I would like to join my colleague, First Vice—President, Frans Timmermans, and I would like to thank, first of all, the rapporteur, Frédérique Ries, the shadow rapporteurs and all MEPs involved, as well as our DGs.  Statements by the Commission (in writing) Proposal of Directive on the reduction of the impact of certain plastic products on the environment COM(2018) 340 final; 2018/0172 (COD) Commission statements in the context of the inter-institutional negotiations The Commission underlines that it is contrary to the letter and to the spirit of Regulation 182/2011 to invoke Article 5 § 4, second subparagraph, point b) in a systematic manner. Recourse to this provision must respond to a specific need to depart from the rule of principle which is that the Commission may adopt a draft implementing act when no opinion is delivered. Given that it is an exception to the general rule established by Article 5 (4) recourse to second subparagraph, point b), cannot be simply seen as a \"discretionary power\" of the legislator, but must be interpreted in a restrictive manner and thus must be justified. While the Commission notes the agreement reached by the European Parliament and the Council on the recourse to this provision it regrets that such justification is not reflected in a recital. __________________________________ The Commission regrets the short deadlines for the adoption of implementing acts and guidelines referred to in Articles 4(2), 7(2), 9(2), 13(4) and 11a and expresses concern about the feasibility to comply with these deadlines in time. __________________________________ With regard to the notion of biodegradability, the Commission will carry out the task referred to in Article 15(3)(d) of the Directive based on the specific mandate included in that article.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 156, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Bronis ROPĖ", "mepid": "125214", "text": "  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture. – Thank you, Honourable President, honourable Commissioners, colleagues.

There is this plastic vortex in the Pacific, which is already five times larger than my own country, Germany, and that is why we urgently need to act.  Wherever an equivalent replacement is possible, we need a ban. This is the case, for example, with plastic plates, where there are, of course, paper plates as a substitute, preferably washable plates that can be used several times. And where the replacement option is not yet so mature, there is the reduction strategy. I would also have argued for us to make the reduction targets a little clearer, but we must now appeal to the Member States to make this as strict as possible.  I would like to thank all those who have helped: Frédérique Ries, of course, but in the GROUP, above all, Karl-Heinz Florenz and the President-in-Office of the Council, Elisabeth Köstinger, who also helped us to have this result through skilful negotiations.  At one point, I am glad that we did not go over the top: there were amendments from the Greens to ban the rise of balloons, and I believe that this would have been disproportionate. Here, too, we should focus on innovation, on new products, but not on people spoiling the fun.

Indeed, more than 80% of litter found on our beaches is plastic, and about half of it comes from disposable products. Without action, by 2050, more plastic will swim in the sea than fish. With an ambitious package of tailor-made measures, we want to turn the tide and keep litter out of our seas and oceans.  Plastic is a valuable material, but we handle it very carelessly. We must make full commitment to sustainable and responsible management of plastic across the entire value chain. This is not only good for the environment, but also for the economy and for the climate, because we prevent CO2 emissions. With every ton of plastic we recycle, we take a car off the road. It is also essential that producers now contribute to the clean-up of litter. 90% of plastic drink bottles have to be collected separately and we are also resolutely fighting with the plastic cigarette filters.

I am convinced that part of the discussion in relation to these challenges will be based on what we could call the 'Sergio Leone logic' – The good, the bad and the ugly, Il buono, il gross e il cattivo. There is very good plastic. Anyone affected by cataracts – and this will happen for most of us – can replace the cloudy lens with a plastic lens, and see clearly into the future. It may be needed especially in the Commission, but it may not be completely wasted in this House either. There is of course a lot of evil plastic, plastico gross, one would say according to Sergio Leone. In order to meet the challenges, we will need an investigation into all the plastics around us. Technically, we have 18 different plastics in the world, and if we manage to classify them in any way, we may also meet these challenges. Getting this investigation into is, of course, the Commission's task for the forthcoming parliamentary term. We also have what you might call fake plastic, plastico cattivo. During the discussion of this issue, I was visited by the Norwegian Minister for the Environment.

Mr President! First of all, thank you to Frédérique Ries for an excellent job. Thanks also to Frans Timmermans - it has been a pleasure this time. This is the second time we have had a lot to reduce plastic. Last time it was about plastic bags, and then it was a minor war. Now I have to say that we have a whole different tone. It is the repentant sinner who has found the way, the truth, and the light, and I am so grateful for that. Of course, it has also become easier now that it has become a popular issue at the same time - without, however, accusing Frans Timmermans of populism. I've had a real commitment.  We have a good law here, but we must remember that this is only the first step. Hopefully it is a safe step that will take us forward - initially to stop the supply of pollution. Every minute, the equivalent of a truck full of plastic waste is poured into the oceans - so much more needs to be done. In this context, I would like to warn against all the smart solutions with biodegradable plastics. It is all as problematic as the ordinary plastic. It was great that we got banned oxo-plastic, which is really bad: the fake degradable plastic that just falls apart and turns into microplastics. So we need to be vigilant, because there is a huge interest in coming up with smart alternatives.

It is never forbidden to go ahead with this. Large quantities of these disposable products also end up in the North Sea, including in the Baltic Sea.  I believe that the directive is also a contribution to a better awareness that the rapid discarding must simply be stopped. We need more durable products and not these disposable products, which have also been thrown away after single use. I also see that we need to do a lot for the design of packaging.

By banning it all of the other items on the list of banned items included in Annex, Part B, of the proposal for a directive – plastic straws, cutlery, stirrers, cotton buds, etc. – are specific product items and not a whole category of products made from a particular material. EPS is the only specific material that has been singled out on the banned list, yet the statistics upon which this Commission based its proposal do not show that EPS food service packaging is a significant problem on EU beaches. All types of food and beverage service packaging and other items combined, including EPS products, account for just 4%-6% of beach litter. A ban on EPS food and drinks containers was included in a last-minute amendment announced just before the plenary vote. That set up the European Parliament’s negotiating mandate ahead of the informal trilogue. There was no opportunity to counter the misinformation circulated at the time. It was incorrectly stated as justification for banning EPS packs that 31% of beach litter is polystyrene. This is entirely untrue. In fact the Commission’s figures show that 31% of beach plastics is a make-up of mixed plastic fragments of varying sizes, including some expanded polystyrene. Some of the EPS pieces in this fraction derive from sources other than packaging e.g. fish boxes and construction products. Therefore, banning these products is both unjustified and disproportionate. The benefit to the environment will be virtually nil. This measure, rushed through without adequate research, will result in companies being put out of business and hundreds of people losing their jobs. This is not speculation. This is fact. In my own constituency 250 jobs will be lost by 2021 if this goes unchallenged. Extrapolate that across the EU – and there are 29 businesses directly affected by this – and thousands of European citizens will lose their livelihood. The EPS ban should, and will, be challenged. The correct source of action is to remove EPS from the banned list. I would just like to display to you the flag of the area where the jobs will be lost. Please take notice.

This dossier is especially important. European citizens are very aware of the waste that plastic generates; some even advocate a total ban on this material, but we must be both pragmatic and understand that there are still fields where there are no alternatives. That is why, from our parliamentary group, we want to encourage investment for greater innovation by industry that makes alternatives to plastics viable and replaces them with new, more sustainable materials. A transition in the use of these materials must be ensured to reduce our footprint on the environment in which we live. We owe it to the generations that come.  Moreover, this transition to a fully circular economy is an opportunity for the generation of new jobs with great added value and economic growth for the re-industrialization of the European Union.

We will not stop seeing terrible images of how islands of plastic are created in the oceans or beaches are being filled around the world. The reason for this is that Europe accounts for only a few per cent of the plastic produced and for an even smaller proportion of the plastic that actually ends up in our seas. Most of it is spread and created in Asia. Only five countries in Asia account for 60% of all plastics. I am sure there are some people in here who say that this means that Europe does not have a responsibility. I would say the opposite.

There are a few exceptions, but, by and large, it applies from left to right. I was wondering how we got here so fast, because we did reach this point quite rapidly. If you think back three or four years, I don’t think we were there yet. That is why, after the thanks we gave to the rapporteur and to the co-legislators, I think it’s only right that I should mention also those who have contributed to creating a sense of urgency in broader society, because that’s what’s driving us. There is a huge sense of urgency in European society that this needs to be done and it needs to be done now.  You have Boyan Slat, who was mentioned before; you have the Plastic Soup Surfer; and you have Ellen MacArthur, who was one of the first sailing the seas, discovering the extent of the problem. You have the wonderful Blue Planet series by David Attenborough, who had a huge impact on public opinion. You have the wide-ranging media, who have taken up responsibility to create public awareness. You have the educational system that takes responsibility here. You’ve also seen the force of the NGO community across the European Union creating the sense of urgency. Academia has played a wonderful role in finding new solutions. If we are to say today that it’s quite remarkable that we got here, we have also to be grateful to all those outside the political sphere who got us to this point. I do agree with those of you who said it’s only a first step. With all the self-congratulation here today, we should also remember that we have a long, long way to go until we actually have a circular economy. This is an important step. It’s also a unique step because it takes the full circle of plastic into account. It’s a unique step that is recognised at the global level. The United Nations always give questions about this. Asian countries are very much interested in what we are doing. Latin American countries as well. Even though our share of the pollution is relatively limited, our change of economic model has a global impact, and it will also change economic models elsewhere.  So don’t let anybody discourage you by saying that Europe only has such a small part. The size of our economy is such that, if we change our economy and create a more sustainable economy, it will have an impact on the economies of other parts of the world. It is already having an impact. Plastic pollution is something that is felt across the board and by many countries and many regions. I also want to add that – to be very, very clear on this – it will also affect packaging. We have put plastic packaging in the proposal. It should be recyclable or no longer used by 2030. That’s something that’s in the proposal. We also want to go further. Microplastics are a huge challenge to our health, and we need to come up with proposals: firstly, removing it from products where it’s not even needed. We don’t need microplastics in detergents. We don’t need microplastics in cosmetics. Then we need to look at products where we still need them and look for alternatives: in tyres, for instance. Tyres are one of the worst polluters in that area.  Just to give you my sense of urgency, this is something we will still have to do, whatever the composition of the next Commission. I am confident, because since this is something that is shared by the full political spectrum of this House, it will also be something that will be shared by the next Commission, the next European Parliament and the Council.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 207, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Frédérique RIES", "mepid": "4253", "text": "  Rapporteur.

Together we were able to conclude this report in this legislature. The result of this report reflects the work of you, mine, the farmers, the profile associations, the fertiliser producers. We have all taken heart and made our contribution, so that this report has a fair, coherent form and helps all sectors involved.  For two years we fought to support our ideas and to defend our consumers, industry, farmers and agricultural future. And today we reap the rewards. The roads of our work and ideas are in front of you and waiting for the vote of confidence. We negotiated intensively with three Presidencies: the Estonian Presidency, we negotiated with the Bulgarian Presidency, where we were very close to concluding, and finally, under the Austrian Presidency, in the fourth trilogue, last November, we showed that we are able to compromise in order to reach a consensus. And I want to thank, on this path, the Austrian Presidency. There were tense moments and meetings and many emotions during the negotiations. Whoever says it was a simple file is wrong. I want to assure everyone present that, following the adoption today and the entry into force of the report on fertilising products, all actors in the agricultural industry benefit, but also consumers. The new regulation, which will replace the regulation 15 years ago, concerns the opening up of the internal market for fertilisers of all types, is part of the circular economy package and concerns the opening up of the internal market for fertilisers of all types and the harmonisation of limits for all contaminants. At present, half of the fertilisers on the European Union market are not covered by the current legislation. Currently, only 5% of organic waste is recycled and used as fertiliser. This new regulation aims to replace up to 30 % of the volume of non-organic fertilisers. Today, the European Union imports more than six million tonnes of phosphate per year, but could recover up to two million tonnes of phosphorus from sewage sludge, biodegradable waste and ash resulting from the neutralisation of animal waste. The agreed text introduces limits for all contaminants, such as cadmium in phosphate fertilisers, to reduce risks to consumer health and the environment. Limits on cadmium content in EU-labelled phosphate fertilisers will be 60 mg/kg from the date of application of the Regulation, i.e. three years after its entry into force. So, to sum up, European consumers will have healthier food, by imposing reduced heavy metal limits on fertilisers, European farmers will have access to a wide variety of safer fertilisers, will have access to organic fertilisers that will circulate freely in the single market, thus encouraging the use of recycled materials for the production of fertilisers. The industry will have a greater selection area from which it can choose its raw material suppliers, thus avoiding the potential monopoly or artificial price of the finished product and saving thousands of jobs. With regard to the placing on the market of fertilisers, I would like to make a point: Member States will still have the possibility of laying down national rules for national marketing. Mutual recognition of products between States is also possible.  I would like to mention that - another very important thing for me - I have also argued, and that sufficient incentives must be given for the development of fall-growing technologies and for the management of hazardous waste rich in cadmium through relevant financial resources.

Mr President, Dear Commissioner, as a co-negotiator, I have worked this renewed legislation. This makes it finally possible for farmers and gardeners to use more organic fertilizers, such as animal manure and compost, instead of fertilizer. Until now, farmers have only been allowed to use a limited amount of their own valuable manure to meet the fertilisation needs of crops. What they had left, they had to dispose of for a fee, but at the same time they were allowed to feed fertilizer. That's the world upside down, and I think it's also undesirable for the environment.  The fertilizer industry is the largest emitter of CO2 in the European Union. It is the largest user of natural gas in the Netherlands. Moreover, I believe that organic fertilisers are important for a healthy soil life, and a healthy soil life is again the basis for a profitable farm. It is important for good water management, for healthy crops, for biodiversity and above all, it also reduces the leaching of nutrients to the ground and surface water. In other words, a win-win situation. The farmers knew this for a long time.

It’s a great result for improving the regulation on fertilising products. I would like to thank the rapporteurs Mr Ţurcanu, Ms Gardini and Mr Huitema, as well as the shadow rapporteurs, for all their valuable input to this file.  This regulation contributes to the implementation of circular economy principles as far as nutrients for agricultural production are concerned. The current EU regulation on fertiliser only covers fertilisers from mineral materials, as you have said. The new regulation will introduce a new legislative framework and therefore considerably simplify the current legislative framework for inorganic fertilisers. The new regulation will be a huge step towards opening the single market to innovative products, made out of organic by—products and recoverable waste. Of course these products must be produced under strict conditions to ensure they are safe for our health and the environment. I’m also very glad this really seems to affect small and medium—sized enterprises a lot, which is a good thing and something we want to improve. Organic fertilisers represent half of the fertilisers’ market in the EU. They have an enormous potential to make European agriculture more efficient and sustainable and help create jobs and opportunities for emerging businesses in the EU. With your vote today, we will bring these products within our European regulation and hence allow them access to the single market. At the same time this regulation provides safeguards to protect public health and the environment. It would also set mandatory limits for contaminants in fertilising products such as mercury, arsenic, nickel and in particular cadmium. It is good that we will now have a common limit with regard to cadmium, and after four years of its application we will assess whether this limit can be reduced.  So we’re moving in the right direction. The compromise reflects a fair balance of all the diverging interests. We strongly believe that it will be a win—win—win: a win for the EU fertilisers industry, which will benefit from easier access to the single market for innovative products and a more diverse range of cost—competitive raw materials; a win for farmers, who can choose from an increased diversity of fertilisers, who can supply their own raw material to fertiliser manufacturers and who will be in a much better position to protect their soil from toxic contaminants; and, most importantly, a win for the health and well—being of EU citizens and our natural environment, as the risk of food and water contamination with toxic substances will decrease.  Finally, I know the importance that this House attaches to the question of defining safe criteria for replacing chemical fertilisers with processed manure. The fertilising products regulation is part of the circular economy action plan, as it substantially contributes to the implementation of circular economy principles in the sector of nutrients for agricultural production. In parallel, under a different work stream, the Commission is working to ensure an integrated and more sustainable management of nutrients to reduce inefficiencies and avoid nutrients pollution, which can affect human health and the environment.  The processing of manure offers possibilities for more efficient use of nutrients, from the agricultural as well as from the environmental point of view. This is why, via its Joint Research Centre, the Commission launched a project in 2017. It includes literature review, modelling and experimental work to define the conditions under which replacing chemical nitrogen containing chemical fertilisers by processed manure in agriculture applications does not entail additional environmental risks. As an aside, I really admire the translators here today.  This work is ongoing and a draft study report should be presented in principle by the end of 2019. As these criteria concern the use of fertilisers, and not their placement on the market, they are not affected by the Fertilising Products Regulation and not expected to affect the implementation of that regulation. However, they certainly constitute an additional and complementary action to foster an efficient and environmentally safe circular economy. To conclude, allow me to reaffirm our full support for the compromise found. We count on you today to take an important step in building a circular economy for the EU fertilising products industry and ensuring that these products are safe for our health and the environment. This is also another important concrete step towards implementing the UN sustainable development goals and building a sustainable European future, which has become more urgent than ever.

Thanks for the word. I, too, share the joy that after three years of negotiations, even after a challenging trialogue, we have managed to complete this process.  The process in which we add organic fertilisers in the rules, which have so far been mainly regulated by mineral fertilisers, and as we know, this is also one of the first packages also from the circular economy that we have got on the tables. For the aim is to increase the proportion of organic fertilisers and not to discard the much-needed nutrients that are hidden in these organic things.  As has already been said here today, it is absurd that compost has now been treated as something that had to be removed correctly, rather than used as fertiliser.  However, in order to do so and to apply the rule to the whole of Europe, this regulation was needed, which sets out the parameters in which we also ensure that the situation in terms of environmental pollution is of sound quality.  We've also arranged the area around heavy metals.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President of the Commission, fertilisers are essential for agriculture, but their use can also have a negative impact on the environment and on food security, especially when contaminants are present in these products. Their proper and safe use is therefore essential for sustainable agriculture, food security and environmental protection. The modernisation of the regulation on fertiliser products is part of the \"circular economy\" package, as this legislation aims to put on the same footing conventional inorganic fertilizers, which generally follow the linear economy model, and organic fertilizers by promoting the reuse of raw materials currently disposed of as waste. Sustainability, food safety and environmental protection objectives go hand in hand with ensuring that our farmers can afford to buy high quality products across Europe. These new rules maintain this balance and encourage the development of innovative products that could help farmers achieve better yields. This is therefore a crucial step in the transition to the circular economy within the European Union. However, I am not entirely satisfied, of course, with the result, especially on cadmium, even if efforts have been made. Indeed, the results of the trilogues are much less ambitious than the negotiating position we voted for here in plenary.

It was so strange that these strict regulations primarily hit the chemical industry, Polish the Grupa Azoty Group, the second largest fertilizer producer in Europe, and the Russian deposits lobbied. And the stakes were high, because the fertilizer industry in the Union is worth €25 billion. However, during two years and turbulent negotiations, such drastic cadmium content standards were abandoned and 60 milligrams per kilogram of fertiliser and a three-year transitional period with a revision clause have now been proposed. This is the most far-reaching compromise below which it is in no way possible to go down. After all, no clear scientific evidence has been provided for such a stringent cadmium limit.  We must remember that phosphate fertilizers are very expensive at present. More expensive fertilisers and the concentration of the fertiliser market are destabilising not only the chemical industry, but also agriculture in many EU countries. Further, Poland has the lowest cadmium content in the soil and due to the beneficial parameters of the soil there is no risk of its accumulation. Furthermore, the proposal to mix mineral fertilisers with organic matter is a risky solution, if only because of the possibility of microbial contamination and antibiotics, and some eu competitors could invest in production in regions of the world where there are no such cost-effective regulations.

It aims to establish a competitive environment for organic fertilizers that is equal to that of mineral fertilizers.

Nevertheless, we can regret the lack of pragmatism of some, who have had difficulty giving economic actors reasonable objectives and time frames to adapt to the new compliance criteria.

I particularly welcome the decision to waive unrealistic, low and completely unjustified allowable levels of cadmium in phosphorous fertilisers. We opposed these proposals in order to ensure the long-term competitiveness of the fertiliser sector in Europe, as well as the viability of agriculture and the food industry. However, the 60 mg limits adopted, for which I wanted to thank the rapporteur, Mr Ţurcanu, are still high, restrictive and will result in a marked increase in production costs. Moreover, this applies not only to the level of heavy metal content, but also to other technical requirements which are imposed on the production of fertilisers. This will have far-reaching adverse effects on the cost-effectiveness of both this sector and agricultural and food production.  I would point out that the rules for the placing on the market of organic fertilisers and waste from agricultural crops and animal husbandry as raw materials for the production of fertilisers are still unclear. It is also doubtful whether a number of agronomicly unproven induers, the use of which does not necessarily involve greater efficiency and may increase production costs, are also questionable.

This regulation was designed to address the risk of concentration in EU central counterparties and put in place the safeguards needed to deal with the most extreme scenarios in ensuring the recovery and/or the resolution of central counterparties. The financial crisis led to the use of financial derivatives being better regulated, and this is the final piece in that post-trade regulatory framework.

It is a very sensitive and very difficult topic because Kosovo is the last country of the Western Balkans that still hasn’t seen visas abolished for free travel to the European Union. I would like to remind us all that Kosovo met all the requirements for a visa-free regime a long time ago, and this House, the European Parliament, also gave the green light for Kosovo’s visa-free regime a while ago. The European Commission recognised that Kosovo has met all the criteria, and I would like to remind you that Kosovo had more conditions than any other countries of the Western Balkans. Kosovo met the last two remaining sensitive issues some months ago – one was to ratify the demarcation of the border agreement with Montenegro – which were highly sensitive and political issues. But they managed to achieve it, including with a fight against corruption in high political elites. That’s why I strongly recommend that tomorrow we reconfirm visa liberalisation for this country. To be very frank, today all the other countries of the Western Balkans have visa—free regimes. It is a very important message for the citizens of the accession countries because it is not only important for political and economic contacts, but it is important for people—to-people contacts. Today Kosovo is the most isolated country in the Western Balkans. We are just talking about visa liberalisation. I don’t want to discuss other issues that Kosovo is dealing with today because, with intention, we have to focus on what Kosovo has delivered. So today I will, with all my criticism, point to the European governments and say that didn’t deliver their promise. Their promise was that, once Kosovo meets the criteria, we will deliver a visa-free regime. I would like to ask the Council – and no one is present here – why they didn’t put it on the agenda, and when they are planning to put it on the agenda. We are losing our credibility. To be very frank, politicians, businessmen or potential criminals don’t wait for visas. They travel freely. What we are discussing is visa-free travel for those who are in need, with certain limitations of course. Visa-free travel has certain limitations and people in Kosovo are aware of that. The campaign is ongoing and we have to deliver what we promised. I would remind you that, in other cases – when we delivered visa liberalisation to Ukraine or to other countries overnight – it was an easy political decision, and now the European governments are blocking a little country in the Western Balkans without real reasons. So I would encourage us all, because we are finishing our term in office, to reconfirm tomorrow the mandate you already gave me and this is that we support visa—free for Kosovo. Once again, the country has met all the conditions. The European Commission recognised that, but today it is the European governments that aren’t acting. We have too many cases today where the European governments are blocking our credible European policies and visa policy is something that is really at the heart of Europeans. It is something that is very tangible. I understand the frustration of citizens in Kosovo when they feel that we asked them to deliver something and they did deliver, but now we aren’t acting. Not the European Parliament. We did our task, but the task is now in the hands of the European governments. So my message to you tomorrow, when we vote for the mandate and reconfirm it and conclude the first reading, is: please support it because people in Kosovo are watching us and they are watching us with great expectations and hopes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 246, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Tanja FAJON", "mepid": "96911", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I welcome this debate on visa liberalisation for the people of Kosovo, and I would like to express once again my thanks to our rapporteur, Ms Fajon, for her continued work, personal engagement and efforts to support this proposal. Since launching the visa liberalisation dialogue in 2012, the Commission has closely worked with Kosovo to support the authorities in fulfilling all the benchmarks of the visa roadmap. We acknowledged, in our final report of 4 May 2016, that Kosovo had taken important steps towards the visa-free regime. This is why we proposed, as you remember, to lift the visa requirements for the people of Kosovo on the understanding that, by the day of adoption of the proposal by Parliament and Council, Kosovo would have ratified the border demarcation agreement with Montenegro and strengthened its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. Two years later, on 18 July 2018, following the necessary efforts and progress, the Commission confirmed that Kosovo has fulfilled all benchmarks of the visa liberalisation roadmap, including the two previously outstanding requirements. Subsequently, we called on the Council and the Parliament to move forward with our proposal. I would like to thank this House for the swift support it has given to our proposal.  Let me recall that the conclusion of the border demarcation agreement with Montenegro is a huge step forward, and it was not easy, even though this is politically sensitive, and we should say so. A number of Member States voiced concerns about the migratory risks posed by the citizens of Kosovo and the need to learn from the past. I am aware of these concerns, and I can understand them. Kosovo is also aware of them and is cooperating and in touch with several Member States directly to mitigate the risk. We have encouraged, and will continue to encourage, the Kosovo authorities to continue, first of all, to implement all the benchmarks; second, to strengthen their anti-corruption and rule of law framework; and third, to keep up the work on migration and security, as well as the need to clearly communicate with citizens about their rights and obligations under a visa-free regime. Dear colleagues, let me recall that Kosovo is the only western Balkan partner that does not benefit from a visa facilitation agreement, and its citizens are the only ones in the region who need a visa to travel to the European Union.  I have said plenty of times that the visa-free regime comes with rights and obligations, and the Kosovo authorities are well aware of this. They have done their part of the work, and I trust they will continue doing so.

In May 2016, the Commission presented its latest two proposals, namely kosovo to ratify the agreement on the border with Montenegro and to continue the fight against organised crime.  To date, these two criteria have already been met, as the Commission's report found in 2018. In addition to these last two criteria, Kosovo was subject to a further 95 criteria, which were met. Due to kosovo's commitment, it is high time that the diligent negotiations and efforts made by the Kosovo Government were rewarded with clear results. It is time to show the citizens of Kosovo that the European Union is reliable not only for its own citizens, but also for its friends outside the borders of the Union.  I think it is time to show European and Kosovo citizens that when we set clear criteria and a clear result is achieved, we in the European Union fulfil our commitment, and this commitment is to allow kosovo citizens to travel freely within the European Union.  Let us not forget that Kosovo is the last country in the Western Balkans for which visa liberalisation is not a fact. Let us not justify international crime, because visa liberalisation is not the barrier that will stop this crime.  I would like to recall some facts, namely that the number of asylum applications from Kosovo has decreased dramatically, that Kosovo has signed 20 readmission agreements with European Union countries, that Kosovo has launched a campaign to inform citizens about the right and obligations of the visa-free regime, that Kosovo has increased the number of border police as a preventive measure, and that Kosovo has a legal framework , which covers all aspects of terrorism and is in line with the acquis communautaire and international counter-terrorism instruments.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very Almost three years ago, the Commission proposed to exempt Kosovo from the visa requirement, because even then the Commission was convinced that Kosovo would also fulfil the final conditions for visa liberalisation in good time. And the Commission confirmed last July that this has indeed happened. And yet today we are not voting on a trialogue result. The visa liberalisation roadmap was presented to Kosovo four years after the other states in the region, and some Member States are still delaying and blocking the negotiations. This isolates Kosovo and slows down European integration. How are we to explain to the people there that the EU is suddenly taking further conditions out of its hat, after the country has already met all the criteria for visa liberalisation? This attitude not only contributes to the EU losing its credibility in the Kosovar population – and possibly beyond. The promises we make to Kosovo must be kept.

Mr President! There are many good both concrete and general reasons for being sceptical about visa liberalisation in relation to Kosovo. First of all, there is the low-practical argument that there are a number of EU Member States that, even to this day, do not recognise Kosovo as an independent state. This makes it difficult for the Council to break the deadlock that has surrounded the whole process. In general, however, I would say that what concerns me and my colleagues in the ECR Group is very much the focus of unilateral visa liberalisation rather than the opposing considerations that remain. If we look at areas such as organised crime, we have seen major problems in the Western Balkans in general in relation to the impact that has been on eu countries. That is why it is a perfect precaution to apply for visas. That is why we can only regret that liberalisation has gone too far.  In addition, I personally am very concerned about the increasing radicalisation we have seen in certain parts of the Western Balkans, and therefore our general attitude towards the whole issue of europeans' security is that prudence should be the guiding principle. In this context, visas are a very good instrument for filtering people who gain access to the European Union. In general, we feel that the Commission should be more focused on making repatriation agreements compared to the many rejected migrants that exist in Europe, rather than further visa liberalisation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 251, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Angelika MLINAR", "mepid": "125026", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I would like to start by thanking our rapporteur, Tanja Fajon, and all the shadow rapporteurs, for all the efforts made on this file. The file has been a work in progress in the European Parliament since 2016, when already at that time, the Commission proposed lifting the visa requirements for the people of Kosovo by transferring Kosovo to the visa—free list of short stays in the Schengen area. As mentioned before by Commissioner Avramopoulos, the Commission announced last July that the two most important requirements for the visa waiver had been fulfilled. Firstly, Kosovo had ratified the border demarcation agreement with Montenegro and, secondly, Kosovo has strengthened its track record in the fight against organised crime and corruption. In September, Parliament voted in favour of entering into interinstitutional negotiations, and tomorrow we will vote to keep the position positive, so the visa waiver can be finalised during the next legislature.  Kosovo has been isolated on the Balkans visa liberalisation map for far too long. Visa liberalisation would be a fair and natural next step for this country. The benefits of a liberalised visa regime are considerable. This decision will further facilitate people—to—people contacts, improve professional and educational exchange, boost economic partnerships and strengthen social and cultural ties between the EU and Kosovo. This agreement would also help the EU to promote reforms in third countries in relation to strengthening respect for fundamental rights and the rule of law. The visa waiver can even help to discourage people smugglers whose services would no longer be required.

Mr President, Kosovo is a country of less than two million people. The war, which bloodied the country, left more than 13,000 people dead. It is the only Balkan state that has not benefited from the liberalisation of short-stay visas, of course, since these are the only visas that are under the union's jurisdiction. Northern Macedonia, Montenegro and Serbia have had it since 2008, Albania and Bosnia since 2010.  As our rapporteur has written, Kosovo is now isolated on the map of visa liberalisation in the Balkans. It was asked to fill out a more detailed list of criteria than any other country, which was done. The Commission came up with a legislative proposal in 2016.  We are used to moving very quickly in this area, to ratify liberalisation agreements, including already in force, especially for charming Oceanic islands, such as the Tonga Islands, Tuvalu, Nauru, Kiribati, Vanuatu and a few others, for which there is indeed little chance of nationals arriving in our territories, but they are designed for a few privileged European tourists.  The post-liberalisation massive arrivals syndrome is always contradicted by the facts, especially in the Balkans, not to mention the future role of ES and ETIAS.  Even if not everything is perfect, Kosovo has made a lot of effort, far beyond what has been asked of its neighbours. Issues of corruption and the justice system are often highlighted, but its neighbours do not do better. The European Parliament has done its job, the European Commission's proposal was adopted in September 2016 and the negotiating mandate given by our LIBE committee has been confirmed in plenary in 2018. However, the Council has not yet adopted a negotiating mandate. The real point, as has already been said, is that five Member States have still not recognised Kosovo.  Our group is largely in favour of visa liberalisation and freedom of movement, and for our many, we do not wish to make an exception for Kosovo.

And I have been involved on many occasions in the inclusion in the negative list of the Regulations of several countries such as Colombia, Peru, Taiwan, Georgia, Ukraine, etc. All these countries have a common characteristic: they are sovereign states.

We cannot provide political instruments that facilitate the dismemberment of a sovereign state such as Serbia. Our position as a Spanish People's Party is well known. The Union is made up of twenty-eight states. The Regulation is for twenty-eight States, not twenty-three. How would partial application be possible?

Among the neighbouring countries, Kosovo, more than most, needed a visa-free regime from the beginning of the process at the Thessaloniki Council. All four Commission reports demonstrated Kosovoʼs rapid progress and its readiness to be a part of the club. We expected Kosovo to fulfil its 95 benchmarks and it did so. So by what legitimate criteria can we deprive our partners of this right? If the EU aims to promote the principle of justice and openness with Kosovo, why don’t we deliver on our promises? 84% of Kosovars are in favour of EU membership, and in my opinion, we must consider Kosovo as a future member as of now. It is unacceptable for us to undermine the regional role of the most pro-EU country in the Western Balkans.

One cannot keep moving or pushing the finishing line; otherwise, we risk Kosovo and, most importantly, its European minded citizens turning their backs and running in the other direction.

To others that still have some doubts, I say that for visa liberalisation the recognition of statehood is not a condition. There is only a need to recognise the travel documents. Increased radicalisation has nothing to do with limited visa-free travel for – mostly – young people and for tourist purposes. But, yes, increased radicalisation can be a result of Kosovo’s isolation and the growing despair that the EU has failed to deliver on its promise.  Once again, Kosovo has met all the benchmarks set by the European Commission – even more than the other countries of the Western Balkans. The European Commission has recognised that, the European Parliament has that, and if you today say Kosovo is not fulfilling the conditions, you are simply lying. You are simply behaving irresponsibly. I urge the EU governments to respect the Treaties, to take a decision on visa waiver for Kosovo, with a qualified majority. The Council does not need unanimity. Stop these games and shameful political purposes, and act now.  Tomorrow we will vote in order to secure a first reading procedure in Parliament. This is not the final vote, but it is an important vote to point a finger at EU governments, showing we in the European Parliament are ready. This is our message again tomorrow. We are keeping our promise, now it is up to you to show your credibility, to show that you care for young people, that you care for young families and for a young country that for far too long has been isolated.

We have a lot of uncertainty because Brexit has not yet been resolved. We do not know what will happen in the next 48 hours. But we assume that our budget should be prepared in any case for a hard Brexit, a chaotic Brexit or, of course, for the British to remain in the European Parliament, which would of course be our first priority. We have therefore negotiated with the Bureau of the European Parliament. We have insisted on savings, we have cut a total of 18 million. We have reached an agreement with the Secretary-General. That is why it is important that we want to fight fake news and fake news first and foremost in the forthcoming election campaign. Here I believe that the European Parliament, through the European Science Media Hub, has found a new group that can take active action here. We want facts, we want good justifications. And I believe that a peer review of what the European Parliament decides should be the basis for honest and transparent reporting. We also have the point that the Statute for Members should be respected. We have the voluntary pension fund. I believe that we have the right here to ensure that what has been promised by the legislation and by the three institutions is respected. Personally, I cannot be friended of the Bureau's decision to take appropriate steps in this. Ultimately, however, it is also a question of continuing to regard the office lump sum as a flat rate. I believe that it is important for Members not to be suffocated in the paperwork. Bureaucracy in the House is definitely too much. We see that there is a great deal of staff tied up here, and the purpose of lump sums is to relieve us of the problems of bureaucracy. Ultimately, it is up to the member or Members to decide what expenditure is made here. That is why I also believe that, of course, if a hard Brexit actually comes now – that is, 6.1% of MEPs – we will have to push through the corresponding changes in the autumn. One of my major problems is also the gender pay gap that we have, because it is about the assistants, the group staff and the civil servants being paid on different bases. All work seriously and well. I therefore believe that they also have a right to equal pay. The European Parliament should also be a model here. I also believe that the medical service should play a leading role in the field of harassment in the future and that trainees need adequate remuneration in the future, which should of course also be taken into account in the secretarial allowance. The final point is that the delegations to official missions are sometimes very lavishly equipped. I believe that Members should decide who to take with them: a group staff member, assistant or translator. This would save us enormous costs. I believe that the European Parliament is perfectly capable of saving a lot of money.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 280, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Vladimír MAŇKA", "mepid": "28192", "text": "   I don't know what I' – Mr President, when drawing up the European Parliament's budget, we must focus on our main mission and make optimal use of resources to improve legislative work. Things that are not related to our mission must be excluded from the budget to the maximum extent possible. Exactly 10 years ago, as chief rapporteur for the budget of all the European institutions, I was in the same role as today. Back then, the lack of planning, the lack of communication on the available translation capacities prevented their effective use. The institution that was supposed to provide translation often automatically placed an order to freelance translators without figuring out whether internal capacities were available within the other European institutions. In the area of translations within the institutions alone, we have found reserves of more than EUR 10 million per year. Since then, many things have improved in this area. But even today, it is necessary to look at how cooperation between the institutions works. The spare capacities of each institution must be made available to the other institutions. We can certainly find millions more reserves and savings here too. Colleagues, together we are fighting for higher growth, employment, a better standard of living for the population. Sometimes we put obstacles in the way of this effort ourselves. Some parliamentary assistants, instead of meaningful work, have recently literally produced written questions for their Members for the Commission. The main reason? Because post-social websites and then some media rated MPs as active accordingly. In 2015, the number of questions to the Commission approached 1 700 per month. Together, the answers to these questions employed more than 100 people in the Commission and in the European Parliament. The cost amounted to almost EUR 13 million per year.  It's hard for me to say, but there are cases where for those who ask, the answer isn't what they need. Then let us not be anoyed that the Commission will evaluate some of the questions as questions asked in numbers. And then the Commission will underestimate the answer and may not answer the question honestly asked responsibly.  Over the last three years, we have managed to substantially address this problem and reduce the number of questions to the Commission by 9 000 a year, and we have reduced costs by more than EUR 7 million per year. I would like to thank you, honourable Members of the Budget Committee, for supporting the proposal on Monday by a large majority to complete the process of the so-called oral explanation of vote. Because that's another bureaucracy. This will bring further savings of a million euros a year. Interpreters will not have to interpret unnecessarily in all languages of speech intended only for listeners in a Member's home country. After all, we have other tools to explain to our constituents how and why we voted. It will be a further reduction in bureaucracy. We want to further reduce the travel costs of staff between Brussels, Strasbourg and Luxembourg. For example, instead of traveling more use videoconferencing. We are also solving other problems. This is to help accredited assistants who work two terms and sometimes miss literally a few days or weeks to meet the criteria for resolving their social and pension rights. We want trainees, without increasing the European Parliament's budget, to have the cost of living covered during the traineeship and guaranteed income. Sometimes in the European Parliament, but also in any other institution, psychological or sexual harassment can occur, causing severe psychological and physical trauma to victims. We can't do without a professional mediator or psychologist and other experts in this area. I'm glad we found a deal here, too. We have been working for many months to simplify the procedure for approving the European Parliament's budget. We're almost at the finish line. I trust that, after the Elections in May, new Members will bring this process to a successful conclusion. If this succeeds, we will save the entire spring part, save human resources and funds. The budget is built on the assumption that Britain will leave the European Union by agreement. If there is a hard Brexit or if Britain does not leave in the end, we will have to adjust the budget through the budgetary procedure. The decision of the people of Great Britain to leave the European Union fell under the influence of fake news and misinformation. We therefore need to be able to explain the European Union project, its positives and achievements to our citizens. One of the tools to bring the European Union closer to the people without everyone having to travel to the European Parliament is to come to their regions. We are starting to build mobile exhibition and presentation devices, so-called \" Parliamentarians that come directly to your region. They will bring you the work and real results of European cooperation in a fun way. This will be of great benefit, especially for young people from schools.  Thank you, shadow rapporteurs from all political factions. We searched and found the best solutions. I also thank my co-workers and advisers. Due to the forthcoming Elections to the European Parliament, everything took place in a shortened mode and often deep into the night. Sometimes on weekends. My coworkers voluntarily and on their own initiative. You would not believe how dedicated some people can work, even though they know that they are also ending up after the European Elections in May. I want to thank them sincerely for that. They're great people who don't get lost in life. This is, after 15 years, my last report in the European Parliament and my last speech.

And, given that this legislature is over, I also believe that we can take advantage to take stock of the legislature. In these five years prudent management has been done, with moderate increases linked to inflation and we have adapted to the new circumstances, from the need, for example, to increase security in our buildings to combating fake news, to adapting to the likely possibility of a new reality of a Europe to twenty-seven. And when we talk about budgeting, we are talking about an administration budget, which aims to effectively use the resources available to achieve its ultimate goal, which is to legislate. And an institution that intends to legislate from outside doors has to set an example of doors inside. And we've made progress, but it's cost us a lot. Because, for example, it was in 2013 that from the Youth Intergroup we launched the campaign in which we asked this House to force its fellows to pay a living wage, and we have made it, but it has taken us five years. And we also have to be an example in the fight against sexual and work harassment, and here we have enough to be. But thanks to parliament's 'Me Too' movement and the efforts of some Members, a catalogue of measures to lead the fight for equality has been put on the table. And if we are talking about equality and example, it cannot be that in this House we are forced to choose between the right to vote and the right to enjoy maternity or paternity leave.

If we demand transparency and savings from others, Parliament itself should be able to do so. Unfortunately, this level of Parliament's budget is still too high, even though some savings were made in committee. My group is therefore, above all, advocating transparency, transparency and reasonable spending. One important factor in promoting transparency and transparency would be that Parliament's building policy would not be financed by oversized costs from other sites. At times, it seems that money is being budgeted for the various budget lines quite deliberately over and then, at the end of the year, it is transferred to buildings. If money is to be spent on buildings, I believe that it must be done transparently within the framework of the normal budgetary process. Then there is the second point, the increase in personnel costs. It is almost 6% on this budget line, on a budget line. I received a reply that the increase is due to statutory expenditure, such as index increases and promotions. That is a lot of this 6%, if that is the reason for it, but apparently it also includes a few dozen new posts, which parliament does not actually decide on, at least not openly.

In general, of course, we believe that we also need a budget with which Parliament can work well. We want to do a good job, and we must have the resources to do so. Until now, Parliament has always tried to stick to having only two per cent, only to be able to say – and do so – that we want to spend most of the money on European citizens and on good programmes and, of course, not just on their own interests. In principle, this is also a correct idea, but we must all be able to work properly here, and that also means – and I will stress this once again – there must also be an internal balance between the interests of the groups, us MEPs, but also of the administration. If you have too much tension in this system, it just makes you annoyed, so you have to find a good balance there as well.  However, in all the ambitions that Parliament can formulate on what we need in terms of money, I also believe that, for example, in the case of translation services – and this is not directed against the translators – we do not need certain languages, we do not have to register them, and we can save money on this. The same applies to travel. We have already become accustomed, for good reasons, not to take with us all those who might be interested, but to concentrate our delegation trips on certain colleagues and then to be very efficient. And business flights on short distances don't always have to be. That is why we have been campaigning for years. Therefore, there are certainly opportunities for savings.

Throughout this parliamentary term, we are talking about EUR 370 million that has been given to the parties.

Mr President, today we are talking about the european Parliament's estimate of revenue and expenditure for the financial year 2020. In total, Parliament has budgeted over EUR 2 billion, almost an additional EUR 4% or tens of millions more. This enormous sum is needed, among other things, to further indoctrinate European citizens with talk of so-called European political awareness and European values, in short, talk. To this end, various \"Europe Experience\" centres and mobile installations are being set up in the Member States: expensive offices from which EU brainwashers can spread their questionable propaganda.  Of course, there is no mention of the greatest threat to European values. For Mr President, the arrival of millions of fortune seekers from Islamic countries has disastrous consequences. Intolerant Islam is incompatible with our free Western values. The fight against Islamisation should be high on the agenda in every European country.  I return to the budget plans. Once again, there is a missed opportunity to cut Parliament's expenditure substantially. Why are MEPs' salaries not being reduced by 15%? And why is the general expenses allowance not being abolished and replaced by a more real, less fraud-prone system? And what will happen to the generous pension scheme for former MEPs, which will cost a lot of extra money? Parliament takes good care of itself, so well so that additional staff have to be hired. Employees sent to new far-flung corners in Africa and Asia. The madness at its best.  Mr President, the elections are imminent.

We are told by the Europhobes that this Parliament is an expensive place but it compares well to other similar Parliaments, such as the US House of Representatives. This is a big continent of 508 million people in the European Union and democracy has a value. And if that value is not worth EUR 4 per citizen per year then we really are in trouble, and we need to defend that. Of course we could make other progress. We could scrap the second seat and if Mr Macron is serious about reform he can help us, because he’s the only real person who can help us address that. We have to, as a Parliament, have priorities and I believe that one thing is absolutely key and that is that a multilingual Parliament continues. I think the priority of a Parliament should be the ability of Members to address everyone in this Union, which is why I’m afraid I am opposed to the notion of removing translation from any element of this Parliament.

Of course, I take note of the reduction of EUR 18 million obtained by the Committee on Budgets compared to the Secretary-General's original proposal endorsed by the Office. Personally, I find this reduction insufficient.  The percentage increase in Parliament's budget should, in my view, not take into account the weighting of wages, new needs, exceptional circumstances, to be in line with the rate of inflation. When I see that the appropriations for staff compensation will increase by almost 6% next year, I wonder, either about the quality of the inflation forecast or what is hidden from us in this increase. I am particularly concerned about two other points. I am concerned about Parliament's intentions to increase its activities and diplomatic presence in a number of countries, including Indonesia and Ethiopia. More fundamentally, even though there are embassies of the Member States of the European Union in these countries and an often costly representation of the European External Action Service, I find it hard to imagine the added value of such settlements for Parliament.  On the other hand, I am not enthusiastic, unlike my colleague Mr Maeka, about the proliferation of European experience centres, the species of mini-Parlamentariums that we want to set up in all the countries of the European Union.  It is certainly imperative, and I recognise this, to put in place effective mechanisms to inform citizens about parliament's work and the priorities it defends, but I would rather invest in people than in stone, brick or concrete.

It is likely, one way or the other, that the UK will end up contributing to a budget for the European Parliament alone of over EUR 2 billion. It’s great to see paragraph 25 calling for the end of the travelling circus between Brussels and Strasbourg, but, like the film ‘Groundhog Day’, this Parliament votes to end the travelling circus in different reports from different committees, month in, month out, year in, year out. Time and time again, it doesn’t get the change enacted because this place doesn’t actually have the power to decide where it sits. That’s the difference between this place and, say, the House of Representatives, which was mentioned earlier in this debate. At least this report does question the latest EU expansionism. It questions suggestions for bigger offices in Indonesia, Ethiopia and New York, which, last time I consulted a map, weren’t in Europe. But what I can’t support in this report is millions more being spent on propaganda by setting up Europe experience centres and mobile installations across Europe and hiring an army of 50 new press officers and media managers. I can’t support even more money being spent refurbishing MEP’s offices, which, last time I checked, were perfectly serviceable. Then we come to Brexit, and this report contemplates various options. Why wouldn’t it? Even as I’m speaking here, politicians in Westminster are still unable to decide whether or not they’re going to implement the referendum result. British MEPs were elected on a Brexit mandate in 2014, the general election in 2015 mandated a referendum, and the 2016 referendum mandated leave. Then 85% of votes at the general election in 2017 went to parties pledging leave. I’m going to blame the European Union for a lot of things, but I’ll tell you what, I’m not going to blame the European Union for politicians in Westminster ignoring the mandates and being unable to decide what to do.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen of the shadow rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, it has been almost forty years since the European Union has adopted legislation on drinking water. We have made considerable progress in all countries. This legislation was first revised just 20 years ago and the time has come for a new revision, if only to act on the scientific advances reflected in the new WHO standards. But we must also, as the Commission proposes, integrate the advance of knowledge in risk management, as set out in the Water Framework Directive, and take into account the expectations of citizens in terms of access to water and transparency.  Last October, we voted in plenary on the report on the revision of the directive. This directive, which mainly reviews the parameters, proposes a new method of risk assessment to prevent pollution risks as early as possible.  This report therefore presents several strong challenges: public accountability, risk-based approach, quality parameters and finally access to water. We must promote access to quality water for all European citizens at an affordable and transparent price to the consumer. With a clear timetable, despite the work that this represented, Parliament lived up to the expectations of the citizens, ready to negotiate the text as early as November to reach an inter-institutional agreement before the end of the mandate. Unfortunately, the delay of the text in the Council does not allow us to find ourselves in a satisfactory situation today. On the contrary, it is a very delicate situation since we have not been able to come up with a text negotiated in trilogue and voted on. Despite all the efforts of the Romanian Presidency, which I would like to welcome, in order to make up for the delay in the Council, the presentation of a general approach at the Council of Ministers on 5 March 2019 is too late. Parliament no longer has sufficient room to initiate inter-institutional negotiations before the European elections.  This report, which is the subject of both technical and political issues important to European citizens, is Parliament's official position for inter-institutional negotiations after its vote tomorrow at first reading. It will now be up to the Finnish Presidency to negotiate this revision with Parliament.

The Commission welcomes the efforts and the fact that Parliament’s amendments are aligned with the main elements of our proposal. At the same time, I regret that due to the slow progress in Council, it was not possible to reach an interinstitutional agreement before the European elections. I would like to recall that the main objective of our proposal is to ensure the safety of drinking water in the European Union for the 21st Century. We should be proud that today most people living in the European Union enjoy drinking water of the highest standard worldwide. With our proposal we will be able to maintain, and even improve, the situation with stricter and more appropriate limit values. Last week, on 22 March, we commemorated World Water Day with the theme ‘leaving no one behind’. Our vision of Europe is that of an inclusive society, which leaves no one behind. The obligation in the revised Drinking Water Directive to provide the most vulnerable amongst us with access to clean water pursues this vision. It is the result of the first ever successful European citizens’ initiative – the right to water initiative – supported by over 1.8 million people and as such a tangible example of how the Commission does listen to European Union citizens’ concerns. The proposal would improve the situation of about two million people in the European Union. The Commission proposal on access to water is also an important step towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6. I warmly welcome the strong support from Parliament to ensure access for all. This support is important in view of the future discussions between the two co-legislators. As you are aware, the Environment Council agreed on a general approach on 5 March. In their compromise text, a fragile equilibrium was found, with very limited requirements on access to water. Some Member States indeed were opposed to access to water being regulated at European level. On the contrary, I know that the majority of the European Parliament, which is the House of the European citizens, wants it to be regulated. Furthermore, the Council proposal for an Article 10A, on materials in contact with water, raises several concerns for the Commission.  Therefore, while reserving its position for the interinstitutional negotiations, the Commission states that it intends to further analyse and assess the concerns on this article and will make the results known to the co-legislators in due time.  I can assure you that the Commission is committed and will do its utmost to support the next European Parliament as well as the incoming Finnish and Croatian Presidencies, so that they can start negotiations as soon as possible.  Let me also underline that, as an honest broker in the negotiations, the Commission will uphold the important objectives of this proposal, which I believe we all share. Finally let me recall that safe drinking water is crucial for European citizens. The solutions we propose will bring positive change to their daily lives. I therefore call on Parliament to support the Commission’s ambition to protect even better the health of our citizens, by proposing strict health standards and by ensuring that they have better access to water.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 300, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Peter LIESE", "mepid": "1927", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Drinking water is the best controlled food in the whole of the European Union. This is also an obligation for us to keep following the latest scientific state, and the European Commission's proposal makes drinking water even safer. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats support this effort, but we have always pointed out in the procedure that the whole thing must also be manageable, especially for small waterworks, and that, in the end, it should not be the profiteers of the proposal that should be the companies that bring analytical methods to the market, but that this is also financially viable for the consumers who end up having to pay for it. That is why we need a sensible approach that improves safety, but which keeps costs within limits, especially for small waterworks. The big issue is access to water. Personally, I think it is a very good idea that we have free access to drinking water in as many places as possible in Europe – in public facilities, in public places – and I also think it is good that we have free drinking water in cafes and restaurants. This is good for the citizens, and we would therefore also take account of the citizens' initiative. This saves resources. We have mineral water, which is often carved over many hundreds of kilometers through the area. This costs fuel, which causes other environmental problems. And as a doctor, I have to say: it is not necessarily advisable to drink mineral water all day long. Tap water is also recommended from a medical point of view. But not everything that we personally like, and not everything that is somehow a good idea, should be centrally prescribed by the European Union in every corner of the European Union. There is also the issue of subsidiarity. That is why we, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, believe that the compromise that the Council has reached is very sensible and that we should also approach this in the trialogue negotiations. Incentives, raising awareness – this is a way of perhaps achieving the objective better than by telling hosts throughout the European Union what to do. This could also strengthen anti-European tendencies. That is why we should support the idea here, but not adopt too rigid legislation. Finally, I would like to express my sincere thanks to Michel Dantin. Unfortunately, he will no longer stand for the European Parliament. He has done a great job in many of the dossiers and also in this dossier.

I would also want to thank our staff and our assistants as well who have worked for many, many months across the complex range of issues covered in this legislation.  Many different organisations and stakeholders have made contact with us throughout our work on this, and I would like to thank them for their engagement and interest. The range of stakeholders interested in these issues again reflects the breadth and complexity of issues in the file. I recognise specifically those organisations concerned with the right to water, who rightly campaigned and continue to pressure us to secure that right in a meaningful way. I’m pleased that the text before us now is stronger in that regard than it could have been and that wording proposed by my Group last year was supported on that basis.  It is regrettable, as has been said, that the Council has taken so long to reach a position on this, meaning that we have not been able to enter into trilogue discussions. That will now happen in the next mandate, and when it does I hope that that Parliament, whatever its political composition, will reflect that commitment that this Parliament has made on a right to water.  Could this Parliament have gone further on that? Yes, we could have done so, but I think we need to see what has been achieved through this report as important work in progress and an important step forward. It would not be acceptable for the Council, or indeed the new Parliament, to water that down. This file is concerned with science, with technology and all those practical measures to ensure that our drinking water is safe and of high quality, but it also addresses, at its heart, a fundamental question of equality and social justice. It cannot be right that today, in 2019, there are people in the European Union who do not have access to clean, safe, affordable drinking water. This goes to the very heart of this Parliament’s commitment to upholding fundamental human rights, and that has been the approach of the S&amp;D Group through our work on this file.  Colleagues, this might well be the final piece of legislation that I work on in this Parliament. If it is indeed the last piece of legislation I’m able to work on in this place, I’m pleased that it is this legislation – a directive which will affect every citizen in the European Union every single day. None of us should take it for granted, when we turn on our taps, that that drinking water is clean and safe. This is not just about pipes and taps; this is about equality and social justice. This Parliament should continue to push for a meaningful right to water for all. There is more to do on that, but this report represents an important step forward in that regard.  When people, as they will in the coming weeks, months and indeed years, say: what does the EU do, what is the EU for? This is what the EU does. It ensures that, whether you are in London, or Berlin, or Paris, or Strasbourg, or Brussels, when you turn your tap on there is a consistency in the safety and the quality of the drinking water we all enjoy.

Water is our common heritage, which we should respect and safeguard for future generations. Due to its limited resources, we should rationally manage it and pay attention to the need to conserve water on a daily basis.  Between 250 and 500 million cubic metres of water are wasted every year in big cities. This amount would be enough for 10-20 million people per year. According to the calculations of some environmental organizations, turning the tap when brushing teeth in a four-person household saves 900 liters of water per month. If the tap leaks and the water drips at a rate of one drop per second, we lose almost 12,000 liters of water per year.  Thus, the directive aims to further increase the quality of tap water by tightening the maximum limits on the content of certain pollutants, e.g. lead, pathogens or substances that negatively affect the endocrine system. Microplastic levels will also be monitored. The new rules also guarantee better access to information.  If we reduced the consumption of bottled water, european households would save around EUR 600 million a year and, just as importantly, reduce plastic waste and greenhouse gas emissions. Tap water is cheap and environmentally friendly, but it must be super-good quality water and must be constantly controlled. Free water distributors should be allowed to be installed in public places, including restaurants. Thus, circular economy measures, support for sustainable management of drinking water in a resource-efficient way, which will help reduce bottled water consumption – in turn, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and marine litter.

My party, the Free Voters, has traditionally advocated more citizen participation. It is therefore of particular concern to me that we take the motions of the citizens' initiatives seriously and that we respond to them quickly and comprehensively. I think that we, as a Parliament, have also acted accordingly. Despite the technical and political complexity, we presented our report back in October. We were ready for negotiations with the Council in the trialogue. Unfortunately, however, the Council has taken so much time that we can no longer adopt the directive in time for the end of the parliamentary term. This is a wasted opportunity. We must therefore conclude our report at first reading tomorrow. In doing so, we are sending a signal to the citizens that for us, citizen participation is not just a sham, but is being practiced.  With our report, however, we are also making good proposals in terms of content. For example, I am proud to offer a solution for how we can deal with microplastics and other new pollutants in drinking water in the future. In this way, we create confidence in water quality. We are also making proposals to ensure that the new risk-based approach does not become a burden on tried-and-tested structures, such as municipally organised water suppliers in Germany or micro-suppliers in the Alpine region and other regions.  I hope that we will be able to record these successes tomorrow for the negotiations of the next Parliament.

Healthy drinking water is a fundamental right that cannot be denied to any European citizen. This is what the European Citizens' Initiative on the Right to Water, which was the first successful citizens' initiative in the EU, made this claim, and as a result of which we can stand here today, and the Commission has put forward a proposal that the European Parliament will hopefully support at first reading tomorrow.  Nevertheless, there are many citizens in the EU who, despite this, do not have access to adequate drinking water. Either because, as members of minority, marginalised groups, they simply do not have access to drinking water and we are talking about hundreds of thousands of people in the European Union, or because their governments, and this is the case in Hungary, are not able to ensure that the quality of drinking water is such that it meets EU standards and meets the expectations we have for healthy drinking water. They cannot ensure this, despite the fact that the European Union is providing millions of euros to Member States to implement the improvements that would enable this to be made. Unfortunately, these resources are not being used properly either. The use of EU funds is often a hotbed of corruption and does not reach the objectives that would result in quality drinking water.  Yet good quality drinking water is not just a health or drinking water issue. As has already been said, if we have succeeded in restoring trust in piped water in the minds of European citizens, we will be able to radically reduce the need for bottled water, thereby also radically reducing waste production. The proposal that we must adopt here tomorrow could contribute to restoring this trust.

So why is it that the human right to water is so special that it deserves this mediocre outcome? We are supposed to be the direct representatives of the people of Europe and yet we are doing a complete injustice to the Right to Water petition, which received nearly two million signatures, and also an injustice to the 2015 Parliament position. We in the left cannot endorse this report. To do so would be to accept the outcome of lenient, à la carte obligations as a response to a Europe-wide petition that sought to effect systemic change. The petition looked to address the serious problem of water poverty, which affects two million people in the EU. The demand that universal access to water would also include affordability.

The objective is generous, but I think it runs up against the principle of subsidiarity. Water regulation is the responsibility of the states, not the Union. If endocrine disruptors and various toxic products contaminate drinking water, it is up to them, in consultation with WHO, and not with the Brussels Commission. As for universal access to safe drinking water, European states are perfectly capable of ensuring it, without the need for the Union's moral lessons.

The first, because it is the only popular initiative that has managed to succeed with more than one and a half million signatures of European citizens, concerned about this issue.  It cannot be less: access to and sustainable management of water, as well as sanitation, is the number six target of the sustainable development goals and, according to Eurostat data, almost 2% of Europeans have difficulties in accessing it. Moreover, such access is an intrinsic part of the European Pillar of Social Rights, which, in point 20, establishes the right to access good quality essential services, including water.  We must also adopt this Directive because it can help us achieve an objective linked to the reduction of waste generation, since the increased consumption of tap water, encouraged by the increase in levels of its quality, can reduce the consumption of bottled water by almost a fifth, while reducing the plastic waste generated in parallel. Higher quality, better access—especially for those more vulnerable and marginalized sectors—greater transparency for consumers in their consumer bill, and lower bureaucracy in improving electronic information systems.

Firstly, according to some estimates, up to 40% of drinking water is drowning in distribution systems, and this is an unsustainable situation for both environmentally, economically and water users. Stricter standards should have been imposed on this in the future, and at least consumers should know in their water bill how much of the levy they have paid has been wasted. Secondly, the new challenges to drinking water quality that have already been mentioned here should have been better taken into account.

This is not only good for the environment, but also spares the backs and wallets of EU citizens. If households drink more tap water, bottled water consumption could be drastically reduced, and households could save up to €600 million a year. It is therefore right that we have once again reduced the permitted maximum levels for certain pollutants such as lead, harmful bacteria and certain hormone-active substances such as endocrine disruptors in order to increase confidence in the quality of our drinking water.

Mr President, this is indeed the last time I have presented a report in this Chamber, so I want to tell you what I have on my heart after hearing a number of untruths this evening.  When we talk about the price of water, we are not talking about the price of water, we are talking about the price of water, we are talking about the price of pipes, the price of sewage treatment plants, we are talking about the price of monitoring the analyses. I hear the two million or so citizens who have signed the contribution for water that is accessible to all. We all share that goal, but I also hear from the millions of consumers who are asking us to keep the price of water, that is, to have investments that are as wise as possible to serve the interests of the consumer, the consumer citizen and to preserve his health. We do not get along with the science. WHO regularly produces data, it is this data that we are incorporating into the European text. When we are told that a number of parameters need to be incorporated, WHO should recommend a method of assessing human health. We do not have this method of evaluation for microplastics, we do not have this method of evaluating human health for endocrine disruptors. So yes, we have to keep working. We must continue to work with determination because water is the essence of life and because access to quality water for all must be a requirement. If we succeed in improving tap water, if we guarantee to our citizens that under any circumstances they will have access to quality water, then yes, we will remove the plastic bottle.  The citizen must know that tap water costs them thousands of times less than the water they buy in bottles in which they seem to have, for some of them, absolute confidence and I question this absolute confidence. Mr President, Commissioner, you are the only two in this house who have a glass of water in front of you. So lift this glass to the health of Europe's 500 million consumers.

Mr President, with this legislation, we are taking an important step towards making Europe safer, getting available information about criminals and terrorists to the right place faster and more fully, to control our borders better and more efficiently, and to ensure that criminals or people with evil in the sense can no longer use and get away with false identities. Here in Strasbourg, just a few kilometres from this chamber in the bunker of the EU-LISA agency building, are the servers that run our European security and border management information systems. Those servers are only a few centimetres apart in that bunker, and yet they cannot and must not communicate with each other to this day. The lack of communication between these European information systems is causing blind spots in our security structure, and this proposal is finally ending them.  Through the European search portal, police officers, border guards and customs officers can immediately request from all information systems the right information they need to do their job at the touch of a button. Through the biometric matching service, we can search with our fingerprints, with facial scans. It is precisely because of this that it becomes much easier to do our work with one system instead of with all these different systems. It's cheaper, it's safer, it's clearer and it's better: don't reinvent the wheel every time, but use our energy more efficiently and efficiently.  Through the common identity register, we create a central repository for biographical and biometric data of people who are not from Europe. Existing data is stored smarter and it makes it much easier for us to do things. We can more easily check the quality of our data. We can more easily streamline law enforcement access to this information, and we can more easily monitor and identify undocumented people on the street. And finally, the last part: the detector of multiple identities. We have seen a lot in recent years that criminals with sometimes as many as 20 different identities are registered in our data systems. We saw it with Anis Amri, the terrorist who was registered under 14 different identities. With these components, we can prevent this in the future. This Parliament has said from the outset that we can only agree to a proposal like this if the fundamental rights of citizens are also properly guaranteed. Good security policy must go hand in hand with guaranteeing the fundamental rights of our citizens, and we have done so. We're not going to collect more data, we're going to use the data we already have much better. We keep the strict access requirements of the underlying systems intact. We have a new web application that helps citizens to guarantee their rights.  This new regulation is also a new way of working that we will be reaping in the coming years. And I would also like to thank Commissioners Avramopoulos and King for their efforts in this matter. I want to thank my co-rapporteur Nuno Melo. I would like to thank all colleagues, but especially the staff, consultants, who have all helped us in recent times to bring this to a successful conclusion. With interoperability – and I am convinced of this – we are really ensuring a safer Europe, and we are doing so by giving the people who are watching over our security, the policeman on the streets, the border guards at the airport, the customs officers at the border crossing – to give these people the right tools to do their job.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 335, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Nuno MELO", "mepid": "96978", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioners, what are we talking about? We are talking about access to information, very relevant information, quickly, systematically and efficiently, but also controlled, which is essential for us to control our external borders, to fight crime, to combat terrorism. Nowadays it is still very difficult to detect cases, for example of multiple identities, various types of fraud committed using the identities of other people. Several authorities, such as SIS or ETIAS, already have information. We can't say that the information doesn't exist. The point is that this information is not shared. Each entity operates barricaded, corporately, in what is its organization, in what is its profession, and does not share them because there is nothing to do with it and, in fact, there is no system that is, at the moment, created and that is sufficiently effective. It is precisely for this purpose that we have worked for a long time here in the European Parliament - and we have worked genuinely - in a way in which everyone has made their contribution, shadow rapporteurs, certainly my co-rapporteur, whom I really thank, Mr Lenaers, commissioners, we have Commissioner King and Commissioner Avramopoulos here, one and the other have been present at our meetings and have given very decisive answers , and especially at the interinstitutional level, Parliament and the European Commission have been able to show that, when they are in any way of what is a priority, we can give the best answers to the citizens. And so it happened. In a report that was very technical, overly technical, we were all able to learn, to look at what was difficult and today we can ensure that, by the time these solutions are implemented, citizens will be safer than they have been so far. I was talking about cases of multiple identities. If we wanted to translate this into two examples in just one of the attacks committed in Germany, one of the terrorists had applied for asylum using fourteen different identities, fourteen different identities! And in another case, in France, one of the terrorists, of Tunisian nationality, was registered with seven different identities. This is very impressive and is the kind of example that, when we tell our fellow citizens, we do not understand. They do not understand, for example, that an attack may take place in France and information that existed in Belgium has not been transmitted. They do not understand that an attack could take place in Belgium and information in France had not been transmitted. Not often for lack of goodwill, but for lack of this system, this quick, expeditious resource, which allows the authorities, having doubts, safely and with respect for legality, protecting data, so they could do so. That can't happen anymore. Citizens' security, effective control of our borders, the fight against crime and terrorism really have to be a priority and if they are not a priority our lack of response is unfortunately measured later in the number of victims and in the world of crime. And we are elected exactly to, to the extent of our possibilities, make a difference. We have to be effective in this fight! I am very proud to end this mandate having been co-rapporteur of this initiative and, above all, that we achieved such a fruitful result when so many, at first, doubted.

Mr President, this debate is a landmark moment for the European Union. It is probably – I say ‘probably’ because there is another issue still waiting – the last time we are debating a security initiative in the plenary and it is also in opportunity to reflect, realising how far we have come in the last five years. From the first time we debated in plenary – it was late 2014 – we saw eye to eye on the need to change the way Member States cooperated on security. To overcome the security taboos of the past and look at internal security as a collective European issue that can only be addressed with more trust and ever-closer cooperation. In this sense our debate today is an excellent case in point in terms of our progress during these five years.  The interoperability of our information systems for borders, migration and security is an issue which concerns all of us. Interoperability is an exercise in the silo breaking, for – while it might sound technical – it is exactly the step change we need to enhance the security of our citizens in Europe, to protect and better manage our common external borders and better manage migration. For precisely these reasons, I would like to express my gratitude to the co-rapporteurs, Mr Lenaers and Mr Melo, as well as to all the shadow rapporteurs and their assistants, for realising the importance of this proposal we submitted a bit more than one year ago.  Interoperability is the most effective way to fight fragmentation of efforts, close information gaps and address the risks of terrorists and serious criminals crossing our borders undetected.  This is the European Union at its best, empowering and supporting our border guards and police officers with the right tools to do their job and protect citizens.  Interoperability is also the European Union taking a decisive step towards an effective and genuine security union, managing the parallel and interconnected challenges of migration and security in a comprehensive and holistic way. All this while making sure, throughout the process and with your great contribution, that fundamental rights will be fully respected, that interoperability is no big brother or a super database and that nothing changes in terms of the access of each official or authority to the underlying data in our information systems.  The involvement of the Fundamental Rights Agency and the European Data Protection Supervisor in the preparatory process of our proposal showed, from day one, that security and privacy are two sides of the same coin, and in the European Union both can and should be ensured. Dear colleagues, our citizens want more and a stronger Europe when it comes to security. We see this in every public survey and we hear it every time we are out there meeting our citizens. Interoperability can be the game-changer in how we use information to the best possible effect to keep our citizens safe.  In an electoral year, this could not be more important. We are delivering concrete action, responding to our citizens’ top concerns. We can all be justifiably proud of this achievement.  My sincere thanks once again therefore go out to all who made a contribution to our excellent co-rapporteurs, Mr Melo and Mr Lenaers, and of course to my good friend and colleague, Julian King, for his dedication, commitment and determination to lead us all to this successful outcome.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 338, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, well, we could have come up with a better name but interoperability is crucially important for some of the reasons that we have just heard. We started by asking those on the front line how we could help, what they needed. And they replied that there were some issues surrounding the handling, the use of information. In particular, there was a challenge surrounding picking up, identifying people who were using multiple identities. We’ve heard that that led to some horrible terrorist attacks. One of the reasons that those on the front line felt occasionally frustrated was because of the way that they used our EU-wide databases and the way our EU-wide databases – security and others – interacted or, in some cases, didn’t interact effectively. We replied that we would take steps to try and help them, to help them to do their jobs to keep us safe, to provide police officers and border guards with efficient access to accurate and complete data, making the best possible use of the information that we had in our systems and finding ways to eliminate some of the silos, some of the gaps and some of the blind spots. Indeed, that is what our citizens expected, as Commissioner Avramopoulos has underlined. Many of them, I think, assumed that we can do it already, which is why it’s so important that we’ve been able to get to this point and take this step.  But all of us who have been involved knew from the outset that there were many complex and, indeed, sensitive issues that had to be managed if we were going to make a success of this. That is why I think we can rightly recognise, as all the speakers have done so far, that we got to this point by working effectively together. The Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE), indeed across Parliament, at the Council, at the European Data Protection Supervisor and Fundamental Rights Agency, from the very beginning.  For me, this is another positive from the work we’ve done around this subject. We have shown that we can integrate all of those different stakeholders from the very beginning of our work and we’ve shown that we can do effective security policy integrating the input from the Data Supervisor and the Fundamental Rights Agency from the outset. And then again, later on in the process, give them an opportunity to check that the work is effectively respecting those key fundamental rights. The work that we’ve achieved together will improve the management of the Schengen external border. It will enhance the internal security of all our Member States. Law enforcement and border guards will have easier access to the information that they are entitled to use. They will be better able to determine when someone has been registered with multiple identities, picking up those who are hiding behind multiple identities, but at the same time, facilitating travel for legitimate travellers. In doing all of this, we have been very careful to maintain purpose limitations and safeguard those fundamental rights. Data processing will be limited to what is strictly necessary and proportionate. No new kinds of information will be collected for the purpose of interoperability.  Indeed, if I may say so, the scrutiny that the European Parliament exerted around this file has further clarified the protections and safeguards, for example around the right to information. And that is something, personally, that I very much welcome. The result is a strong piece of legislation that addresses security needs of our Member States, makes use of innovative technologies, but includes safeguards needed to process data in full compliance with our fundamental rights. I very much enjoyed working – if I can say that on a personal basis – with the rapporteurs, Mr Lenaers, Mr Melo, and indeed with all of their teams. I know it’s not the usual custom here but can I just take two seconds to thank the Commission team as well who worked very, very hard on this, putting in many long hours. Together we got to this result and once the legislation is adopted it will be for all of us to make sure it’s implemented effectively, starting with eu-LISA, an agency which I know enjoys the full support of this House.  We’re going to have to make sure that all of these measures that we have now agreed are put into practice. The innovations that we’ve set out, that you have underlined, will only make a real difference to security on the ground if and when they are fully implemented, collectively at EU level and in each and every Member State. I’m sure that Parliament will want to continue to monitor closely the follow-up to this file and this question of implementation.

Terrorist attacks in recent years have demonstrated a huge gap in European security. Different law enforcement agencies have a huge amount of information, but they don't exchange it because they don't have the necessary mechanisms. Yes, the European Union has built up a variety of systems over the years, but each of them has a specific purpose and the information in it is stored independently, without being checked against the information in other systems. This has led to a fragmented approach to security.  That's why the need to ensure that the so-called \"no-fly zone\" is on the agenda. interconnection of systems. In a more understandable language, how the different European databases - the visa system, the Schengen system, the entry/exit system and others, to talk to each other and a policeman or border guard, in the process of checking a person, to see if there is a signal for that person in one of the systems.  I welcome the fact that with the agreement reached, this will now be a reality. The competent authorities will now be able to carry out full checks on suspicious persons through biographical and biometric data, will be able to detect the presence of several identities for a person, be able to verify the information available and thereby better assess whether the person in front of them poses a threat to European security.  At the same time, in order not to undermine the rights of innocent people, the protection of personal data will be ensured, with only officers with access to the systems able to carry out specific in-depth data checks.  For this interconnection to succeed, it is the responsibility of The Member States to report and quality information in European databases.

Mr President, Commissioners, today is a day of celebration. For one debate, we have two Commissioners who talk to each other and do not listen to anything, but finally we have the pleasure of having them. I don't want to spoil my pleasure.  If there is one issue that I wanted to see come to fruition in this Parliament, it is interoperability. We have developed and modernized a number of systems in recent years. I quote them: VIS, ECRIS, SIS, Eurodac, ETIAS and so on. But these systems currently have no connection to each other, which weakens the efficiency of the data collected and wastes valuable time for users who need to view it.  Interoperability introduces four new features that I support. I support the creation of the new European search portal whereby police officers on the ground and border guards will be able to simultaneously check all information systems related to justice, security and external border control, instead of having to consult them separately as is currently the case. I support the multiple identity detector by which the authorities of the European Union will be able to detect identity fraud and through which blind spots, in which people are registered under different names in different databases and thus escape their real identification, will be avoided. I welcome the creation of the common directory of identity data which will greatly facilitate the identification of third-country nationals present in the Territory of the Union. Finally, I welcome the creation of the shared biometric data matching service. I would also like to point out, because it is important, that no additional data on people will be collected because of interoperability and that all the data protection rules in place for each system will continue to apply.

No, this is a matter of highly political issues. The European Data Protection Supervisor has warned us that such a step marks a point where there is no going back. The European Data Protection Board also raised concerns, at the time as article 29. But why are our own experts warning against this? In data protection law, there is the principle of purpose limitation. It is intended to prevent a state that knows everything about us and brings this information together centrally. But that is exactly what we are creating when we introduce the so-called CIR with the proposed interoperability. The CIR is a central identity register to which various authorities have access. We are creating a kind of monster database here, in which not only criminals fall, but also innocent citizens. Now we often hear the argument that we have a problem with multiple identities. Especially from conservative circles the example of the assassin of the Berlin Christmas market, Anis Amri, is often mentioned. Let me be clear once and for all: Amri has been well known to the authorities for years, he has been observed, and what exactly went wrong in the vote of the authorities in the run-up to this attack is now being worked out by a committee of inquiry. But a lack of a link between his identities was certainly not the problem. Quite apart from the fact that we are at a point of no return in terms of data protection, security aspects still matter. Such a central identity register, which contains personal biometric data of a huge number of people, is a worthwhile target for hackers who could derail a large number of databases and related services with a targeted attack on the CIR, and I do not want to imagine the impact of a data leak. Unfortunately, during the negotiations, it quickly became apparent that there would be a result that we cannot agree to. It is obvious that an unnecessary and expensive new infrastructure will be created, which will primarily benefit those companies that sell the corresponding hardware and software. In addition, we accept disadvantages in data protection and approach the ideal of a surveillance state.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Let us remember the Case of Amri, where the security authorities failed miserably, not so much because of any multiple identifications and multiple identities, but because the protection of the Constitution has abandoned the observation of Amri. That was the point!  And what happened now? It is clear that instead of a European search portal – which we could somehow understand so that we can identify suspects and criminals more quickly – we have now had four databases caught the eye – in addition to the above-mentioned, the biometric comparison portal, the common identity store, the data store for multiple identities. Anyone who is still talking about technical interoperability, I have to say quite honestly, he is simply lying! This is because it is a question of effectively removing the limitation of the purpose of the connected databases. And the EDPS, like the previous speaker, says that this is a point of no return. Once the purpose is repealed, it is in the bucket, then it is gone, to put it this way – and thus also the data of the citizens an easy prey for the state, which can monitor comprehensively.  The fact is that if you add Eurodac as the next database, migration and crime will be lumped together. The bottom line is that a huge superdata system is being created with data from third-country nationals, which can be used practically without criminality for any identification.

First of all, I would like to thank the report-takers for their excellent collaborative work, especially Jeroen Lenaers, with whom I have worked most.

I am convinced that these databases for different purposes were built separately from each other not by accident, but by conscious data protection reasons. Of course, and I understand, of course, that, in the midst of the current security challenges, we need systems that will enable fraud of personal identity to be prevented and help individual authorities to work more efficiently. At the same time – and we all know this – the protection and proper management of personal data is a highly sensitive area and therefore the transformation of these systems requires very careful consideration.  In this context, I must refer to the reservations expressed by the Fundamental Rights Agency and the EDPS on the need to centralisation of identity management and proportionality, not to mention the huge costs involved. However, I do not think that it can be based on the fact that citizens of third countries inherently pose a security risk to the European Union. I consider this to be an exaggeration and I am concerned about the trend observed in this report, which seeks to limit fundamental rights on the grounds of security.

In general, I would like to say that the proposal, as I see it, is nothing more than another step in the trend to do everything we can to prevent people from entering Europe. However, more monitoring and control does not solve the problems of people being forced to leave their home countries.  On the other hand, we are putting our own values, which are based, among other things, on fundamental rights and freedoms, when we repeatedly adopt legislation that undermines respect for human rights and our own core values. Migrants continue to come, but our fear of them means that we are violating both international and own rules on human rights and data protection. We equate migrants with potential criminals.

What better mechanism, and latest example, but the one we have before us this evening? Along with other colleagues who have already spoken, I’m going to argue that this approach is both misguided and misdirected. Even worse, it is actually cost inefficient. The projected cost of this legislation to the European Union taxpayer is projected to be EUR 460 million. Compare that to the amount spent by the United States of America, with a similar population, on protecting the internal security of its citizens. This, everybody, is a mere drop in the ocean, and if the European Union is serious, then a serious, detailed and transparent budget must be proposed. Some of you have already highlighted another concern of mine, which is the quality of the data. Establishing a European search portal to centralise biographical and biometric data is wholly dependent on the quality of the information submitted. We have numerous instances of crime perpetrators destroying their identification, removing all or any traceability, and thus any accountability for their actions. False European Union passports, we know, are on sale on the black market and they exist in various forms on a very large scale. As for data ownership, has anyone in the Commission – or even at Council level – really considered how 500 million European Union citizens feel about their personal data being collated, managed and accessed in this manner? I am hopeful that the European Union does not envisage a police state, but the question has to be posed, does it?  Finally, I will remind you that the European Union’s sacrosanct pillar of human rights is under siege here.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has First of all, i would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs for their support in advising on this dossier. The Directive on preventive restructuring and second chance for entrepreneurs is a milestone in promoting entrepreneurship in the European Union.  We have a situation in Europe where 200 000 companies have to file for insolvency every year, and 1.7 million jobs are lost as a result. And consider that 50 percent of all companies set up in Europe do not survive five years. In other words, we must promote entrepreneurship, promote entrepreneurship, and if we now facilitate the restructuring of companies that are in financial difficulties, then we are on the right track. And if we also support our start-ups, if they have perhaps not completed their first business, their first start, so successfully, then we have also done something to prevent failure from being perceived as a stigma, as is often the case here in the European Union. We need to make sure that this is part of the learning curve when companies or young people become self-employed.  The starting point for this dossier was difficult: we have very different restructuring rules in 28 Member States. We do not know Member States that are restructuring, such as Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovakia and Croatia. We have countries that allow restructuring under strict conditions, such as my own country, Germany. And we have countries where restructuring is easy going, as in France, Belgium, the UK and other countries. In addition, restructuring is based on different cultures. There are many countries in which, as in my own country, Germany, the sole interest in restructuring, insolvency, is the satisfaction of creditors, while in other countries it is important that the company can continue and that, in the end, jobs are also preserved.  What is now provided for in this directive with a view to preventive restructuring is a good balance between these two different cultures. The directive is divided into three parts: firstly, the establishment of an early warning system to be introduced by the Member States, then the second is a major part of the issue of preventive restructuring, and the third part of the directive deals with debt relief. Early warning instruments will have to be introduced in all Member States in the future. I think it is a good thing to provide companies with tools to identify at an early stage whether their business needs to be restructured. In some countries this already exists, in others it does not. In the case of preventive restructuring, it was important for us in Parliament to strike a better balance between the interests of all those involved, especially creditors and debtors.  The majority of us in Parliament had the impression that the Commission's proposal was a good proposal, but very debt-oriented, and we have now found a better balance through changes in our report. We also wanted to clarify in our report what the role of the parties involved is in the context of a preventive restructuring procedure. For example, we have defined exactly when a restructuring administrator should be mandatory or voluntarily involved in the restructuring. One issue that was also close to the hearts of many colleagues in the European Parliament was the issue of employee participation, workers' rights and employee representation.  We have succeeded in balancing, and I am very pleased about that. We have worked very well here in detail. My final point is that we have also found a proper compromise on debt relief. Now the proposal for a directive as we see in our version provides that debt can be discharged within three years if the debtor also behaves in accordance.  All in all, a good result. I hope that we can convince many and convince us to start a business here, and those who need to restructure now have a framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 357, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Angelika NIEBLER", "mepid": "4289", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the Insolvency Directive, which comes to a vote tomorrow, has two goals – to enable the rescue of viable businesses which are in financial distress, and to ensure that honest entrepreneurs who failed are given a second chance. We agree that, together, these measures will help facilitate the free movement of capital as well as the freedom of establishment for businesses by putting in place a European approach, removing the obstacles that can result from the differences in national laws and procedures on preventive restructuring insolvency and second chances. This development of a so-called rescue culture in the EU is key for encouraging entrepreneurship and economic growth. On behalf of the Commission, I’d like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Niebler, as well as the shadow rapporteurs for their excellent cooperation and hard work to conclude the file to get it to this point.  This directive puts in place minimum harmonisation provisions, ensuring firstly that viable enterprises in financial difficulties have access to effective national preventative restructuring frameworks, which will enable them to continue operating. Secondly, it also ensures that honest insolvent or over-indebted entrepreneurs have a second chance at creating a business after a full discharge of debt, following a reasonable period of time, up to a maximum of three years. Thirdly, the directive will improve the effectiveness of restructuring, insolvency and discharge procedures, in particular with a view to shortening the amount of time that they can take. This in turn will help increase investment and job opportunities across the single market, reduce unnecessary liquidations of viable companies, thereby reducing job losses, prevent the build-up of non-performing loans, and reduce costs and increase opportunities for those entrepreneurs, whom we want to support if they need a fresh start.

By simplifying the rules, we will also support SMEs, 99% of all businesses in the Union, which often do not have the resources for complicated cross-border management.

The path of minimum harmonisation creates sufficient scope for Member States to apply the Directive according to their own needs, while at the same time fulfilling its basic objectives.

In particular, at a time when the economic and social effects of the long crisis we are experiencing have not yet been exhausted, it is very appropriate to put in place all possible legal means that can enable companies to embark on restructuring paths, which make it possible to save economic activity first and which are then aided by formal insolvency and therefore liquidation paths. , thus trying to avoid job losses and, with it, the dramatic social consequences that it often has. The text we are going to vote on is the result of lengthy negotiations that first affected Parliament and then Parliament with the Council. But for this reason, which has enabled us to deal with even the most sensitive points, as my fellow Members mentioned earlier, we cannot regard it as negative. However, we must not hide the fact that we have missed an important opportunity, in our opinion, to ensure strong protection for the most vulnerable in this dramatic phase of corporate restructuring in some territories, involving large European companies but, very often, even the weakest medium-sized and small ones. A restructuring plan normally does not only concern financial matters, which are the most obvious in many circumstances, but restructuring inevitably extends to matters relating to the organization of the company, not only because the organization, when it is deficient, produces the difficulties but also because in order to get out of these difficulties it is necessary to change the organizational model that is the cause of the crisis. Therefore, since it is a company organization that is suffering, the process also concerns the remuneration of workers and employment conditions, meaning by conditions both the number of people involved and the extent and character, including cultural, of the work that is lost in so many circumstances. We have therefore worked to ensure that the need for preventive involvement and full information for workers, as well as for all other actors and stakeholders who are in contact with the company, is recognized and formalized. We have indeed managed, from this point of view, to make considerable progress, as has been said, and for this we must thank, and I am happy to do so, the commitment of the rapporteur, especially during the very long trialogue. However, it would have been appropriate to add a few further and particularly important steps to include the obligation to confirm workers for all those elements of the plan which relate to the organizational aspects of the company, including, of course, redundancies, economic conditions, working hours and material conditions. The absence of this point is one of those missed opportunities for good legislation and real progress for the weakest.

This time, however, not as a workforce, as part of the organization of the enterprise, but, in turn, as possible creditors of a company in crisis. We believe that creditors cannot all be considered at the same level and that it would have been useful and necessary to provide greater protection for the weakest creditors, the workers. In particular, we believe that the provision of a specific class for employee credits cannot be a option for The Member States but should be compulsory. In addition, it would have been appropriate to give this class preferential rights and additional protections over all other classes.

It is well known that effective and efficient insolvency procedures are an element of a good business environment. They support trade and investment. They support job creation and retention and help economies overcome shocks that lead to high levels of unpaid debt and unemployment.  In practice, divergences in national insolvency proceedings can make it costly and protracted to protect the interests of companies, hampering the functioning of national economies and the common market as a whole. Uncertainty around insolvency rules and procedures is seen as a deterrent to cross-border enlargement and investment. Every year, a million and 700,000 people lose their jobs because of the bankruptcy of the company in which they work. With the new directive, we aim to support small and medium-sized enterprises. They will be very helpful in introducing key principles of preventive restructuring and second chance for businesses in the Member States, as well as the introduction of shorter and more effective insolvency procedures.  In addition, we aim to give entrepreneurs a second chance by repaying their debts. This will eliminate perpetual debtors and reduce the amount of non-performing loans on banks' balance sheets and prevent the accumulation of such loans in the future. However, in order to achieve this, it is essential that the discharge rules also apply to consumers. I therefore hope that Member States will take into account the recommendation in the text, namely to combat consumer over-indebtedness by introducing binding rules on discharge as soon as possible.

Mr President, I would like to thank the First of all, I would like to thank the Commission again, Commissioner King, and to the members who have been very committed to the dossier. I would like to stress once again that I believe that we have reached a very, very good compromise and that, above all, we have taken an important step forward in promoting entrepreneurship in Europe.  We have so many talented people in all the Member States, so many talented people, and I think we need to motivate young people to take the risk of starting a business. And that is precisely what this directive is used for, which is intended to make it easier to restructure or to get a second chance in the event of difficulties.  A colleague came forward twice and claimed that money is being pushed back and forth: this is nonsense, of course. This is not state money at all that flows into this restructuring. No, it is about: either you allow companies to file for bankruptcy, or you simply try to help, by intelligent help, by restructuring debt and the like, by helping a company that is sometimes in trouble – this can also have a cyclical impact. And that is precisely the purpose of this directive. In this respect, I am really pleased that we have set in motion a good deal to strengthen the entrepreneurial side here in the European Union. That is what we need!  Not only do we want state intervention, but we need entrepreneurs who create jobs, who also invest, who take a certain risk, and if we create a framework for helping these very companies, then I believe we have done a good job.  I very much hope that the report will be adopted tomorrow by a large majority. I also believe that we have a great deal in the report in order to strengthen the workers' side accordingly.  We have always had the discussion beforehand, Mr Cofferati: do we need to give workers even better support? However, we have given you many opportunities for information and consultation, including within the framework of this proposal for a directive.

Here I would therefore like to thank all those who took part in the negotiations for their patience and will to reach a basic agreement, especially Mrs Niebler.  The implementation of the Digital Single Market is a priority not only for the European Commission, but also for the European Parliament. The Position of the European Parliament differed from that of the Commission on some matters and it was our duty to act in accordance with this decision by most of our colleagues. The European Parliament felt that there was a need to support those who create the works and to provide them with sufficient legal certainty and support for the realisation of long-term projects. We have long said that everything needs to be done to ensure the diversity of European culture and to ensure that The European creators who ensure this pluralism have adequate conditions for their business to be implemented.  The conditions for the existence of many different broadcasters should be encouraged. We are aware of the potential offered by new digital technologies. However, we also want to ensure a stable environment for business. Therefore, the question of the scope of application of the country of origin principle was crucial for the European Parliament. The agreed scope, where the country-of-origin principle applies only in cases of balancing rights for radio programmes, news and own production, is acceptable to the European Parliament. We believe that this is a balanced compromise that will improve the opportunities for broadcasters and consumers who watch programmes over the Internet and, as a result, ensure a wider range of offers. Consumers will be able to watch more programmes throughout the European Union. The European Parliament's request was also, at least to a fundamental extent, to touch on the direct delivery technique that broadcasters are now increasingly using. Although the implementation of this requirement meant changing the instrument from a regulation to a directive, we have also managed to meet this challenge, which is why tomorrow we will vote on the directive, not on the regulation.  Here I would like to stress the need for the implementation of these rules in the Member States to be guided by efforts to ensure respect for copyright, which alone are able to support creators and thus ensure quality and varied broadcasting for European citizens. I believe that the agreement reached is a balanced compromise that reflects the current conditions and possibilities and which, at the same time, does nothing to prevent a possible further step forward if the conditions change further.

It is important that, as online services expand, the barriers to broadcasting are reduced, whilst maintaining the contractual rights of producers and broadcasters over their work. It is important for the health of the cultural sector that they maintain reasonable levels of control over the material they produce.  This legislation does mark some improvements for consumers, and will increase the availability of certain programmes across Europe. This is positive for both producers and citizens engaging with European culture. Information and current affairs will in particular become more accessible. This will allow citizens to access quality news and media across the continent, which I believe will enhance our media sector. It can only be a good thing that we support more trusted information being provided on a European level, and I hope this has the capacity to develop a shared European perspective on current affairs. Fully financed works by online broadcasters will also be included in this Directive. This is also a positive move for consumers online and should increase accessibility for all.  I hope that this legislation will enable progressive forces in Europe to push for improved availability of culture across borders, whilst maintaining a balance with the preservation of contractual freedoms. Culture plays a vital role in forming strong relationships across the continent and breaking down barriers between people. The broadcasts that we share form part of a common experience. We must facilitate a healthy broadcasting sector that can reach out to citizens everywhere.  As with any copyright legislation, the authors and producers must not be forgotten. Those who work to create content must not be vulnerable to exploitation and must receive equitable remuneration for their work. Authors, content creators, writers and other rights holders need adequate protection in the law to ensure they receive just reward for their work. It can never be right for broadcasters to profit disproportionately from the work of others. The protection of creators’ income relates directly to the health of the sector. Those who author information or cultural work must have their incomes protected. They must be able to live from their work, otherwise we risk damaging the diversity of the sector.  Finally, I’d like to look to the future. The Commission, I believe, will continue to reduce the barriers to broadcasting across Europe, and this will contribute to improving the programmes and information that are available. However, we cannot facilitate improved broadcasting without offering support to independent and emerging producers of culture. We must not only look to protect, but also to enhance the diversity of broadcasting and culture across Europe. We must also be careful not to allow broadcasting in Europe to be dominated by a small number of organisations from certain regions.

On behalf of the Commission, we agree that this represents an important part of the Digital Single Market Strategy. Allow me to thank, on behalf of colleagues, the rapporteurs and all the Members who have been involved in getting the file to this point. The Directive will help enable our citizens to benefit more fully from the diversity of content offered by European broadcasters, as we’ve heard, by making copyright licensing easier for broadcasters and retransmission operators that are willing to make more programmes available to more people across the EU. It will also benefit those living abroad, as they will be able to stay connected to their home countries, as well as Europe’s numerous linguistic minorities.  At the same time, the Directive protects rights holders with a number of safeguards. In particular, the new Directive makes it easier for broadcasters to provide access to their radio and television programmes via their online services, makes it easier for retransmission operators to obtain the necessary rights to retransmit broadcasts from other Member States, and includes new rules on the direct injection technique relevant for the remuneration of rights holders. While the Commission supports the text resulting from the interinstitutional discussions, which you’re going to be voting on tomorrow, I have to say that we regret that the original legal basis proposed, Article 114, was replaced with Articles 53(1) and 62. The Commission intends to issue a declaration in this regard.  Commission statement in writing The Commission takes note that the text adopted by the European Parliament and the Council of the Directive laying down rules on the exercise of copyright and related rights applicable to certain online transmissions of broadcasting organisations and retransmissions of television and radio programmes and amending Council Directive 93/83/EEC replaces the legal basis retained in its proposal (Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, TFEU) with the combined legal basis of Articles 53(1) and 62 TFEU. The Commission considers that Articles 53(1) and 62 TFEU provide a specific legal basis, and can thus be considered ‘lex specialis’, for directives concerning access to activities of self-employed persons. Legislation exceeding that scope should more properly be based on the general legal basis related to the achievement of the internal market (Article 114 TFEU). The two legal bases (Article 114, and Articles 53(1) and 62 TFEU) could also have been used in conjunction, if necessary.

Mr President, tomorrow the European Parliament will vote on an important recommendation on the European Peace Facility, a new budget fund outside the European budget worth EUR 10.5 billion for the period 2021-2027. The European Peace Facility is a new financing instrument that will enable the European Union to finance military or defence-related activities in a more efficient and flexible way. How then? By combining the various existing instruments of our external policy under a single budgetary instrument and by filling a number of existing gaps.  So far, only a limited part of the common cost of EU military operations has been funded, we have only been able to provide limited assistance to military activities, only if it was linked to strict development objectives, and support for partner military peace support operations was limited to African-led operations through the African peace facilities. The European Peace Facility will change all this.  Firstly, we will ensure great solidarity among the Member States through better burden-sharing. The European Peace Facility will replace the Athena mechanism and finance a greater share of common costs of operations, up to 45%. This will, of course, make Member States more inclined to participate in operations. Because of course, if you can share more common costs, there are less own costs left. Secondly, it will also contribute to peace-supporting operations of international organisations or third countries, no longer limited to Africa. We will have a much broader base of support. Thirdly – and this is a very important point – we will also be able to contribute to the building up of military and defence capabilities of third countries, just think of their equipment. Let me give you one concrete example: for example, we are doing EU training missions in Somalia, where we can train the military very well. But if they have no footwear, no material, no body armor, what is our training? From now on, the peace fund will be able to intervene in the purchase of, for example, bulletproof vests and footwear, so that the well-trained military can also be deployed.  Finally, there is also a flexibility clause to finance other union operational action in the framework of the common foreign and security policy, with military or defence implications. The European Peace Facility is an additional fiscal fund, which of course means to me that participation and control by this House are important. That is why we also ask for sufficient and timely information and consultation, so that we can take every position into account. That is why we are also calling for assurances that no activities are being financed that violate or are used to violate the fundamental principles laid down in Article 21 of the EU Treaty to violate international law and human rights. And, of course, we must ensure that the instrument is complementary to other external policy instruments. We whine so often, we hear it so often here, that Europe is unable to act, or act too late, that europe lacks decisiveness.  Well, our security environment is becoming more complex, more volatile, more unpredictable and ambiguous than ever. The European Union must then have the necessary tools to promote peace, to prevent conflicts and to strengthen international security, and of course to fulfil its role as a global player in the field of security. The European security facility is a missing link in this. I would therefore like to ask you with conviction to approve that recommendation. I would also like to thank all my fellow shadow rapporteurs for the hard work. This was a not-so-obvious debate, but I think we have brought it to a successful conclusion and, of course, I hope that it will be widely supported tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 380, "date": "2019-03-27.json", "name": "Hilde VAUTMANS", "mepid": "130100", "text": "   Member of the Commission, on behalf of the Vice President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Mr President, let me first welcome, on behalf of the High Representative, your broad support for her proposal to establish a European Peace Facility. This reflects the need, repeatedly emphasised by this House, for funding in this area that is more flexible and efficient and which better embodies solidarity. Let me extend, on behalf of the High Representative and other colleagues, our thanks to the rapporteur, Ms Vautmans, as well as the co-rapporteurs, for their engagement and their constructive and pragmatic approach.  As you rightly recall in your report, the Union’s ambition is to be a global security provider, something which is obviously in our collective strategic interest. Given the growing and evolving threat picture which we face, we need to have the capacity to respond to a variety of security challenges. That was clearly acknowledged in the global strategy in 2016.  The idea of the Peace Facility was born out of our experience, as the rapporteur was just setting out. The EU is active on the ground, but there are strong limitations to what we can achieve currently. For example, we’ve had difficulties in financing the training of soldiers in Somalia and we have not always been able to provide the Central African Republic with the equipment it needs, as was recalled, to complete its transformation from civil war to a functioning modern democracy. The cost of EU military operations fall too much on the countries which are contributing troops, and that acts as a deterrent to others when it comes to participation and deployments.  This new facility, when adopted by the Council, will make a real difference. It will provide the Union with the ability to finance all operational actions under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) with military or defence implications in a flexible, responsive manner. In particular there are three main strands of action that the Peace Facility will support. First, it will cover the common costs of EU military missions and operations. Indeed, more costs should be funded in common to better meet operational needs and to facilitate deployments. Second, it will enable the EU to contribute to military peace operations led by other international actors. And third, it will allow the EU to support the armed forces of our partner countries with infrastructure, equipment or military assistance when the Council so decides. The nature, scope and limits of these actions will be defined by the Council, but the proposal makes very clear that any support to our partners would be subject to strict controls such as respect for democratic principles and fundamental rights.  The High Representative’s proposal benefits from the support of the Commission, in accordance with Article 31. This support will help to facilitate synergies with our other financial instruments and to underpin sound financial management.  In conclusion, let me underline that this is a key part of the work that we’re doing collectively to make our citizens more secure, to better support our partners around the world and to contribute to our most precious common good, which is, of course, peace and security. So let me thank you again for your support for this important initiative. I look forward to our discussion and support tomorrow.

This declaration of intent was meant to encourage projects and actions aimed at promoting peace in its most universal meaning, inspired by the universal ideals of human dignity, freedom, equality and solidarity enshrined in the preamble of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and also confirmed by the Lisbon Treaty in 2009. The Nobel Prize for Peace awarded to the European Union seals and underlines the importance of actions like the Pledge, and also this current proposal for a peace facility.  The Pledge to Peace was intended to create the necessary conditions to initiate a broad set of actions aimed at building a world of peace and prosperity.

It’s very clear what the decision—making procedures will be, and that will be open to scrutiny by all.  Indeed, work is already ongoing in some of the areas highlighted in the report – for example, ensuring that future transfers of sensitive equipment take place in compliance with international law, as well as with the relevant EU rules. This is something to which, I assure you, we will attach the highest priority. We also fully agree that the European Parliament needs to be kept fully informed on a regular basis about the use of this facility. That is a commitment that we happily make.

Mr President, I have heard the word peace, peace and security here many times. Unfortunately, these are notions that a lot of people in the world don't know today.

I have heard many arguments here which were not really relevant. I think that this instrument is really what Europe needs if we are to be more efficient. That is what the citizens are asking of us.
