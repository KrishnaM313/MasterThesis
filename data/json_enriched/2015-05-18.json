The Latvian Presidency, in a letter dated 14 May, let me know that it does not wish to take part in this debate because of the Council's lack of positioning. At the same time, I have received a letter from the Prime Minister, Mr Orban, asking for participation in the debate here. First of all, I would like to inform you purely procedurally that I am not aware of any case in which the Presidency-in-Office of the Council refuses to take part in a parliamentary debate on the grounds that there is no position of the Council.

I will, of course, be invited to this House if he so wishes, Prime Minister Orban. Since I have been President here, I have complied with the rule that members of the European Council can, of course, visit the European Parliament and take their position here if they so wish. I even think that this is the place where European policy is to be made public. That is the European Parliament here! That is why I intend to comply with Mr Orban's wish.

Tomorrow we will vote on crucial legislation: the regulation on benchmarks used in financial instruments and financial contracts. The last few months have been hit again. Investigations, billions in fines, headlines about cheating and scams in the financial sector. The reason this time: fiddling with the 4pm fix benchmark, a benchmark price on which exchange rates of all major currencies are based. And the LIBOR scandal also brought a new record fine, this time for Deutsche Bank. The myth that benchmark fraud is the work of some bad apples within a few banks has now been definitively broken. Manipulation has occurred in many sectors, including large and important benchmarks. All this demonstrates the importance of benchmark indexes for financial stability and also the need for proper regulation to prevent manipulation of these types of systemically important benchmarks in the future. The legislation we are voting on tomorrow is aimed at protecting the stability of the financial system and the real economy. This means that there must be sufficient safeguards for large benchmarks such as LIBOR or the currency exchange benchmarks that we all use on a daily basis. But the regulations must also ensure that a large and diverse range of indexes remains possible, both inside and outside Europe. After all, a large offer allows investors to switch and switch to other benchmarks. Without alternatives, more and more instruments and contracts will be linked to an ever-shrinking group of indexes, resulting in greater market concentration, more power for the producers of the major indexes and, of course, greater risks to the financial system and the economy. Competition in the benchmark industry creates innovation, reduces systemic risks and strengthens market discipline. This means that for smaller benchmarks there must be a balanced treatment in the regulations. The report, as it stands, provides that balance, a balance between large and small benchmarks, between financial and commodity benchmarks, and between those benchmarks produced in the EU and beyond. This balance sheet is sorely needed to protect consumers, to grow capital markets, to promote economic recovery and also to achieve the vision and objectives for a European Capital Markets Union. I think it is also for this reason that the legislative text received the support of the Committee on Economic Affairs by a majority of 48 votes in favour and only 10 against. Fortunately, that support came from parties on both the left and the right. I would like to thank my fellow negotiators, the shadow rapporteurs, very much for the collegial and constructive way in which they have contributed to the drafting of the report. I am very much looking forward to continuing this cooperation in a good way during the trialogues. I call on all the political groups to support this report so that we can quickly and with a strong mandate that we can enter into those trialogues, so that, after almost two years of discussion, we can actually bring good legislation on benchmarks into force at the end of this year.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 18, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Nathan GILL", "mepid": "124965", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, benchmarks may sound like a minor technical issue, but in fact they go to the heart of the financial services sector and to the economy more widely. They are the basis on which financial contracts are priced. They determine the value of great numbers of financial products, including the interest rates paid on many mortgages. The investment and pension funds in which citizens save for their future use benchmarks to determine their value or their performance. So it follows that we need to be able to trust benchmarks, but a sequence of scandals has badly undermined confidence – and let us not forget that this is not a victimless crime. For me, manipulating benchmarks is the same as stealing. So that is why, to rebuild trust, we proposed that benchmark providers should be properly regulated and supervised; that they should put governance controls in place and manage conflicts of interest; that they should make benchmark setting more transparent and ensure that contributors to benchmark setting are appropriately overseen.  For critical benchmarks with cross-border impacts, we also propose setting up colleges of national supervisors, involving the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA). This will ensure appropriate oversight and the continuous availability of these benchmarks by requiring contributions from firms if needed.  This has not been an easy file, but it is a critical one, and I would very much like to congratulate Ms van Nieuwenhuizen on the skill with which she has taken it forward. I look forward to discussing some issues further in trilogue. The broad scope of the legislation means that it needs to be appropriate both for big and for small benchmarks, and although our proposal had elements of proportionality, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Control has proposed a more risk-based approach for non-critical benchmarks. I am grateful for your thinking on this and look forward to helping to strike the right balance.  As the EU will be the first jurisdiction to establish such a wide-ranging benchmark regulation, we must also address the question of access for third-country benchmarks, and while we want to keep our borders open, we must avoid importing risks linked to benchmarks that are not robust. Here again I look forward to discussing how we can achieve those objectives.

Currently, we have different suppliers producing different benchmarks, using different methodologies. Many of the benchmarks have in fact become public goods. As such, its social benefits should be maximised, while the damage caused to the real economy and society as a whole, resulting from its potential poor production or manipulation, should be placed under close scrutiny and subject to criminal and pecuniary sanctions. My opinion focused mainly on commodity price assessments provided by supervisory agencies and physical energy markets. The current provisions prohibiting the manipulation of the benchmarks used do not address all vulnerabilities verified in the production process. Price valuation models vary considerably. We also know that manipulating commodity price valuations can put at risk not only the investor but also the end-user, as this is what determines the price that many households will pay for gas or any other energy supply. Furthermore, we cannot ignore conflicts of interest or agency, which is the case when there is no proper governance and controls. I therefore welcome the legislative initiative in this regard, as self-regulation has proved inefficient.  In my opinion, I tried to minimize the vulnerability of the evaluation process, facilitate the determination of the price evaluated, whether it accurately reflects the transactions of the physical market you want to measure, whether the data are sufficient to represent that market and whether they are in good faith. I have sought to facilitate the ability to detect, deter and, if necessary, take coercive measures in relation to manipulation or other abusive conduct. My final assessment is, however, negative in view of the proposals we have discussed here, not only because my proposals have not been accepted but because the essential issue, that of critical benchmarks, has fallen far short of what it should be. The final wording is very limited with regard to proportionality and with regard to the definition of what is a critical benchmark or a critical benchmark.  I proposed to extend the scope of what is considered a critical benchmark, there were proposals from the Green and Socialist groups, which would be essential to ensure effective regulation of this matter, but all this was refused.

We should say here that many steps were taken in order to make the financial indices that are of vital importance for financial markets more robust. Now we are debating what is probably the last step in the creation of a safer environment that will bring credible and robust financial industries: legislation that is focused on administration of benchmarks and the creation of the indices. As was said by the rapporteur, the proposal was put together quite some time ago and unfortunately it was not approved by the previous Parliament. The reasons were also quite technical. The Commission opted for a very wide and very deep proposal which drives concern for the sustainability of this regulation, especially for small indices. There were many questions concerning the consistency of this regulation with the international environment, which went rather towards the recommendation issued by IOSCO, and obviously it created problems with the third-country regime. I am very happy that I could work on the legislation with the rapporteur because she opted for a balanced approach, focusing on better proportionality between the regulation of important – the most important – indices by allowing transparency to be used for improving the quality of the other indices. At the same time, we improved too the situation vis-à-vis the third-country regime and found the right balance between the responsibility of national supervisors and the responsibility of ESMA.

The position of my group , of the Socialist Group – has been focused on improving the control and regulation of critical indices and, in this regard, in the text being put to the vote tomorrow we have achieved a definition of a qualitative critical index which allows the definition of national critical indices. Further, to the extent that these critical indices are a 'public good', as our colleague Matias said, they will be able to be subject to a reasonable price controlled by the supervisor and, moreover, those critical indices will have a college of competent authorities chaired by ESMA thanks to the text to be adopted by this Parliament.  We are therefore very pleased with the regulation we have achieved so that critical indices (the Eurobor, LIBOR — the large indices that jeopardize financial stability) can be subject to stricter regulation and that, moreover, commodity indices can also be defined as critical. In return, it is true that the negotiation has been complicated and we have had to give in in some respects. That proportionality which the rapporteur was talking about and those who preceded me in the use of the word implies that non-critical indices are going to have somewhat less restrictive regulation. But it is true that, thanks to our group, national competent authorities will have the control power to monitor how the administrators of these non-critical indexes do their job with further analysis in the reports of how these indices are developed.  Finally, we have reached an agreement to ensure that third-country indices comply with IUCV rules.

This text provides a good framework for national competent authorities to supervise benchmark administrators within a sound European framework. This new regime will ensure that investors and consumers are protected across the entire EU. The approach rightly focuses a tough regime upon critical benchmarks and is not overly onerous upon other benchmarks that are easily substitutable. The focus upon transparency to users of benchmarks will allow investors and consumers to decide if they are happy with the way in which benchmarks are compiled and use alternatives should they find it necessary. The more proportionate approach taken within Parliament’s text for non-critical benchmarks is to be welcomed. However, it is only possible if Member States are also able to choose to elevate a benchmark that may not naturally fall into the critical category, should they feel it is systemically important to their domestic market; indeed they should be able to upgrade to critical status if they think that index is particularly susceptible to manipulation.  As we begin negotiations with the Council and the Commission, I would urge all parties to pay particular attention to the way our third-country provisions interact, with a proportionate approach being proposed for non-critical benchmarks. The use of internationally—agreed IOSCO principles to measure equivalence is of fundamental importance to improving the standards that benchmark administrators globally are held to, without creating the many problems we have seen with other pieces of legislation that have had an extra—territorial effect.

Mr President, Commissioner, thank you for being with us.

Commissioner, I very much appreciated your strong words.

I believe that Cora van Nieuwenhuizen has achieved a balanced result with great work also from other political groups. This is worth noting.  On the other hand, personally, I would have preferred an even more determined role for ESMA. This supervisory authority has been created so that, precisely, in the internal market, it is not possible to evade. So in defining the many technical standards, ESMA will have a role, that's true. This institution will also have a role as the ultimate arbiter for the definition of critical indices , I think this is a very crucial point - namely all indices that are not linked to an exchange rate or interbank but which have an impact on financial stability. The management and monitoring of the public register of reference indices is also entrusted to it, and ESMA will have a role in the event of non-compliance with the rules by a competent authority. I think this is going really in the right direction.  Commissioner, I draw attention to the issue of Esma's budget, which is still, like that of all these supervisory authorities, a little threatened at all times. If the Council were there, I would also say it to the Council. There will be a difficult balance to be struck between supervision and close supervision given the influence of certain indices and proportionality given the number of indices.

Mr President, what is striking in the history of the benchmarks is that violations of the law have continued massively, well beyond the financial crisis. You would have thought that the financial crisis would have brought the industry down to a little more reason; but Deutsche Bank has been quoted as a huge financial institution, but there are many others, have been \"having fun\" manipulating these indicators for their benefit, for years, perhaps to this day. Some will say: \"It is good, today they have been fined which are paid by the banks, not by individuals\". I would remind you that in some countries these fines are even tax deductible, so they are paid by the taxpayer. So it was time, of course, for a new regulation to come to light, so I thank Cora van Nieuwenhuizen for the work she has done. We had a compromise almost to the end. In the end, however, some last-minute amendments effectively exempted from this regulation a series of indicators that would otherwise have been considered critical. As you have seen, we have a hard regime for critical indicators and a relaxed regime for indicators that are considered non-critical. A series of indicators are therefore exempt from this legislation. The only thing I can say is that I am pleased that the Member State that controls these indicators the most, the United Kingdom, has not waited for the European Parliament to adopt much stricter regulations than the one we are approving today.

I regret that the threshold for critical indices has been set too high and that the truly binding part of the regulation applies only to Libor and Euribor.

It is in addition to the repeated HSBC scandals, money laundering, aid to tax evasion, indecent bonuses, subprime mortgages, etc. The more legislation is passed, the less state-constrained private banks are and the more they prosper on their backs. The few billion euros in fines are minimal given the stakes of tens of billions of euros a year in profit for fraudsters.

The introduction of such a framework will improve the protection of consumers of financial services, increase confidence and the other will also contribute to improving financial stability at national and European level.

The Libor scandal has already been raised today.

The regulation we are discussing today goes in this direction and focuses on achieving three objectives.

Secondly, increase transparency by making more information available to users of all indicators in order to enable them to make informed decisions.

The broad consensus reached in the Committee on Development, which I hope will be strengthened in tomorrow's plenary vote, was only made possible by the commitment effort of all the political groups, and therefore my first words are to thank all colleagues, especially the shadow rapporteurs, and also the committed support we have always had from the President of the Commission. Linda McAvan. We know that the price of extended commitments is often political irrelevance. Experience tells us that the search for a minimum common denominator often leads to empty proclamations, to the mere affirmation of general principles without practical implications. And in the end, we are all more or less in agreement, let's go home satisfied because each one reads in the text what suits him best. Fortunately, that is not the case with this report. My report proposes, without ambiguity, that the European Parliament make a choice, take a clear position and send a strong political message to the Commission, the Council, the Member States on the leading and responsible role that the European Union should have in the negotiations to be held at the 3rd International Conference on Financing for Development in Alse Ababa as early as next July. It is true that the new challenges we face are difficult and place differently the shared responsibility that was already placed in the Monterrey Consensus in 2002.  But what we are now about is very concrete things: - firstly, for the European Union to urgently reconfirm its commitment to allocate 0.7% of gross national income to official development aid. There can be no further delays or excuses because there will be no leadership by example in Addis Ababa without this commitment; - secondly, that the European Union give credibility to its commitment and to take a timetable for meeting that financial target by 2020; - thirdly, that 50% of this aid, at least 0.2% of gross national income, is reserved for the least developed countries and, because it would be a serious mistake to minimise the importance of public development aid, what needs to be done to do so. There are other topics on the table that will be discussed in Ababa and are also very important: mobilising the domestic resources of developing countries, which requires fairer and more efficient tax systems, more combating tax evasion and evasion, more international tax cooperation, including through an intergovernmental body for tax cooperation within the United Nations. It is also very important that the private sector is more aligned with the objectives of sustainable development, with a regulatory framework that favours it and also with financial instruments and incentive structures that ensure such alignment. Mr President, after the drama we are experiencing and seeing in the Mediterranean, development cooperation with the countries of origin of migration flows, of truly desperate refugees, reminds us also of the urgency of taking this commitment to development objectives seriously, but there will be no serious commitment without financing instruments that live up to our values and up to our responsibilities.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 53, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Pedro SILVA PEREIRA", "mepid": "124747", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the Committee on Development, its chair, Ms Linda McAvan, and the rapporteur, Mr Silva Pereira, for their dedicated work and for the openness of the consultations during the preparation of this report, which the Commission welcomes. It comes at a critical juncture in the post-2015 negotiations, and will make a valuable contribution to the ongoing debate in the Council, which is expected to adopt conclusions next week.  It is encouraging to see that the views of Parliament and the Commission are generally well aligned on the issues of financing for development. We share a vision of a global partnership to eradicate poverty, share prosperity and foster sustainable development while defending human rights, promoting gender equality and social cohesion, and reducing inequalities.  The report is very rich, covering a broad range of issues and making a number of requests to the Commission. I have taken careful note of these – including Member’s calls for increased attention to private sector investments, domestic revenue mobilisation, monitoring and transparency of the Commission’s own aid programmes and attention to the Court of Auditors’ reports on blending. This report will reinforce the European Union’s determination to call for and contribute to achieving a comprehensive global package comprising aid, investment and domestic resources, together with an enhancing framework of good policies and good governance. I welcome the clear support that the report expresses for an ambitious recommitment by the European Union to the 0.7 % of gross national income (GNI) for official development assistance (ODA) target, and to specific ODA targets for least developed countries.  As I have said to Parliament before, the Commission will help encourage Member States to reach an agreement on an ambitious package of measures for the implementation of the sustainable development agenda, including on the ODA commitment. However, the decision on the timetable for reaching the 0.7 % target is ultimately a decision for the Member States. Therefore, when it comes to the 2020 timetable proposed in the report, we need to consider carefully the political and economic realities within our Member States.  The Commission position has been that all developed countries should commit to the 0.7 % target, with the timetable to be set during the negotiation process. I believe we share the same objective: to ensure that the global agreement on financing for development includes ambitious and credible commitments from all. While I believe it is right that we also have expectations of others, we must be ready to play our full part by presenting our clear political commitment to ODA.  I also support the emphasis in the report on aid effectiveness and the need to ensure a higher degree of coordination between different aid mechanisms and donors. Furthermore, we note the call to step up international efforts to find additional climate finance. Mobilising more finance from all sources – public and private – to tackle climate change is, of course, a priority. But, we should be cautious about artificially dividing financing for climate and other development-related activities. Some climate change interventions, for instance, will meet the ODA definition. It is therefore important that synergies across various sustainable development objectives can be maximised to ensure that available resources can deliver the maximum impact.  We particularly welcome the emphasis in the report on the mobilisation and effective use of all forms of finance, including domestic resources, private investment, blending and innovative financial sources. To implement such a far-reaching agenda, we need to consider the full range of means of implementation. Good policies, trade, innovation policies and other non-financial resources will be just as crucial. They can make a real difference.  The Commission is cautious, however, about two recommendations in the report: to establish an intergovernmental body for tax cooperation and to establish a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring. We are in favour of further discussions and analyses on these complex issues through an inclusive and participatory dialogue. The debate, in our view, should focus more on the substance rather than on the form and format of the statutory mechanisms of a multilateral legal framework.  The Commission is particularly cautious as regards the call for a multilateral legal framework for sovereign debt restructuring. Whilst finding sustainable debt solutions is highly important, the post-2015 negotiations should avoid pre-empting or duplicating ongoing work on sovereign debt restructuring in the context of other fora, notably the IMF.  The report contains many other interesting ideas and suggestions, which we will take carefully into account in finalising the EU position ahead of the Addis and New York conferences.

Mr President, first of all, I thank Mr Pereira for introducing the debate with a report and a talented presentation. The vast majority of the Committee on Development is behind the conclusions drawn from this report, and I can only congratulate myself on the quality of what has emerged from our debates. The European Union will leave for Addis Ababa with good news and bad news. The good news is that it will, once again, commit to spending 0.7%, according to a timetable that depends on the Member States. The bad news: it had already made this commitment in Monterrey, in the context of an identical conference, where the timetable also depended on the Member States. Member States that have met the 0.7% target will be able to congratulate themselves and proclaim their mission accomplished in Addis Ababa. The others only have to reread the speeches they already gave in Monterrey a dozen years ago. Schematically, this conference has two components: a quantitative component and a qualitative component. The quantity, as I said, has been the subject of various commitments that have not been kept. Quality must, of course, be directed at those who need money most for official development assistance. This quality must respond to indicators of efficiency, relevance and also sustainability to respond, in fact, to the OECD's method of doing so. We must also add that aid must be predictable, in order to enable the major players in official development assistance to rely on predictability that allows them to make longer-term commitments. Hence the invitation to the Member States and the Commission to do so and not to arrive empty-handed in Addis Ababa. Finally, I would like to emphasise the principle of differentiation: if we are to act effectively in the area of official development assistance, we will have to apply this principle, which the Commission is calling for and which we have supported, which aims to remind those who generate enough resources today to support themselves , especially middle-income countries, so that we can focus our aid on those in dire need.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 55, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Paul RÜBIG", "mepid": "2278", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the I would also like to thank Commissioner Mimica and the rapporteur, Pedro Silva Pereira. We worked well together. I believe it is important to work out good solutions with the rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs. I believe that this report clearly sums up our wishes. We all know that, of course, the Court of Auditors has also looked at what has happened here since 2002, particularly in terms of expenditure here. There is certainly a need for action and improvement. But our aim is to offer perspectives to people in the least developed countries. That is why it is also a question of how we finance joint development aid in the future. The target of 0.7% is undisputed. The only question is when it can be achieved. After all, we have states in Europe that are struggling themselves and on the verge of illiquidity. That is why I believe that a general, general solution is not possible in a short period of time. I believe that by 2020 we should be watching to ensure that all the Member States of the European Union reach this 0.7% in order to improve the economic environment in the least developed countries. It is also, of course, a question of achieving greater efficiency on the expenditure side. It is not enough just to give money. Money alone is not enough – you cannot eat that – but it is very much a question of considering new structures on how to help on the ground in the various areas, e.B. in the area of health – we have seen in the case of Ebola that this has been designed very effectively – and, of course, also in the areas of education, energy and water supply.

I come from Germany, a not exactly poor country. But Germany is failing on this issue. Germany has hardly developed any progress in the commitments. Germany has so far achieved 0.4% instead of 0.7%. We have four countries in Europe that have achieved this goal; let us also be clear: these are great Britain, Sweden, Denmark and Luxembourg. And the other Member States are sticking to the noble target of 0.7%. But there is not even agreement on the timetable. This is a single disgrace to our Member States.

When we talk about financing for development, we are not just talking about securing sufficient funds, solidarity and at least 0.7% of GDP to achieve the sustainable development goals.

Today poverty and inequality, far from slowing down, continue to rise. As the International Labour Organization points out, it is urgent to develop a binding framework of social guarantees for all – including basic income – that guarantee dignity and human rights. But to do so, the mobilization of national financial resources through fair taxation in all States is necessary. It is essential to focus on combating tax fraud and illicit capital trafficking, as well as strengthening fair, progressive and redistributive tax systems. Austerity policies are condemning many people to pay for the recklessness and greed of a few, which are enriched while the vast majority continue to become impoverished. The lack of a regulatory framework based on mutual responsibility of lenders and borrowers, which analyses the legitimacy and sustainability of states' sovereign debt, has become a global problem and a drag on endogenous development. To this end, it is prevailing that the European Commission and the Member States will work together on the work that is beginning to take place at the United Nations for the creation of a sovereign debt restructuring framework.

We must not fail at this financial conference in Addis Ababa, because it is really about facing huge global challenges. Above all, of course, the fight against poverty: it is no longer enough to halve poverty; We have new challenges which, in fact, are not so new, but which are increasingly of increasing acute importance. I am thinking, for example, of climate change, and in that sense it is also very important that the rapporteur has, in the final stages, brought forward a proposal for an amendment in which he emphasises the utmost importance of helping communities to become more resilience against all such natural disasters, which are also caused by climate change. I would like to stress that the Council should not now impose any additional restrictions and conditions on this objective of implementing official development aid, but that the 0.7% target must be achieved without reference to any acute economic situation, because one can only imagine how bad the developing countries will be if we suffer from bad economic conditions here. This 0.7% is not only a kind of global tax that we need to implement, but it is also all the things that the committee emphasises that are part of this palet, especially the collection of taxes in developing countries, so that they can finance their own activities.

We are talking about development funding and the Addis Ababa Conference. And it is important that we come to this conference with a strong, decisive and clear position because, probably, when we discuss the problems of the world, the importance of development cooperation is probably not yet very clear.  Today we are constantly witnessing tragedies related to immigration, linked precisely to the merchandise of people and to continuous deaths in the Mediterranean. Perhaps if there had been more attention to development cooperation in the developing countries, in the countries from which we are fleeing, in the transit countries, these tragedies could be addressed differently. We know very well – and there is no point in us circling around – that very often our own countries go to these countries to exploit resources, to generate civil wars. And then we find ourselves, as Mr Neuser rightly said, talking about official development funding with the richest countries in Europe, including Germany, which does not even want to put 0.7% of gross national income and is limited to 0.4%. That is why we hope, at least, that the Council will be able to find a shared position, that this type of assistance will be made compulsory.

Poverty, war and also the lack of freedom and bad governance is what makes desperate people undertake dangerous journeys in the search for a better life in Europe, and development cooperation is an important part of the answer to this challenge. We all agreed at the last session in Strasbourg that development is important, but we need to remember it now when we are talking about the financial contributions. Thus I support the rapporteur and the Commission in their call to the Member States to recommit to devoting 0.7% of GNI to official development assistance: yes, taking into account national budgetary constraints, but also taking into account the fact that the EU needs to remain the leader of global development efforts. I also share the rapporteur’s views that we need a truly global partnership and that all developed countries as well as emerging and middle-income economies should take their fair share of the burden in the fight against poverty. Furthermore, we need a completely new approach to financing development. We need to go beyond Official Development Assistance (ODA) and work on mobilising all types of finance: public and private, international and domestic. In all these efforts ahead of the 13th National Conference in Addis Ababa, we need to be aware of the fact that finance alone will not be sufficient. Policies are of fundamental importance in achieving sustainable development goals. We need policies that will ensure that financial resources are used effectively and in areas that will bring further mobilisation of resources and sustainable development. We need to invest in enablers of development and yes, most of all, we need to invest in good governance. If we get back, for example, to the issue of migration we will see that this is the key question – the question of governance. Many migrants are not even extremely poor, but they are all extremely desperate. They are ready to give thousands of euros to traffickers because there is not good governance. Therefore, our development policy needs to focus on this, and the Conference in Addis Ababa could be an important opportunity to make a significant step in that direction.

In September, we should agree at the UN on the new sustainable development goals, which apply to everyone. The new agenda must be ambitious, but in order for these objectives to be truly achieved, including by completing the unfinished work of the Millennium Development Goals, we must have the necessary resources to do so. Mr Silva Pereira's report makes this clear: the success of the post-2015 agenda will also depend on the level of ambition that will be demonstrated at the Addis Ababa Conference. And if we claim European primacy as the first donors, we must commit ourselves once again and indeed to allocating 0.7% of gross national income to official development aid, presenting timetables in stages to achieve the objective that must not be conditioned by other donors. Equally important, and this is well highlighted in the report, is the mobilisation of national resources, the most important source of funding for developing countries; we need to strengthen international cooperation in the field of taxation and aid in this respect: this is essential not only to achieve new objectives but also to enable dependence on foreign aid to be overcome in the long term. Linked to this is the global issue of tax avoidance and evasion, which cause huge losses to developing countries, which risk nullifying aid. Combating these practices must therefore be a priority for the European Union.

The North-South fracture is probably the most obvious and vivid expression of this inequality, not the only one. With economic inequality comes political dependence and subordination.  There are several instruments that promote this cycle of increasing impoverishment, dependence and subordination. This is the case of external debt, which is repeatedly paid and, nevertheless, always increasing. There will be no serious or effective development cooperation policy without addressing this issue, nor without the essential cancellation of this debt and the mechanisms that underpin it. It is not about solidarity, it is a question of basic justice. In the name of debt, the interventions of the IMF and the World Bank deeply weaken the already fragile economies of developing countries and promote the drainage of endogenous resources to so-called donors, resources that exceed the amounts of official development aid, thereby accentuating inequality.  Official development aid is crucial and should increase, even in accordance with international commitments made but not fulfilled, but it is not sufficient in itself and cannot serve as a screen to hide the disastrous effects of sectoral policies, based on protectionism of the rich, trade liberalisation, the deregulation of the financial system, tax havens, nor to export and impose models of economic and political organisation that , so often, they disrespect the sovereignty, needs and legitimate choices of developing countries.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Nathan GILL", "mepid": "124965", "text": "   – Mr President, I would like to make two points. One is on setting targets and the second is on aid-giving itself. This institution believes that nations setting targets of 0.7% of GNI and an EU foreign aid budget of EUR 960 billion can only have positive outcomes. As is always the case, just throwing money at problems seldom solves the problem. The reality is that the culture of targets has caused an environment of deceit. In the UK, the Conservative Government is very proud of the fact that we achieved the target of 0.7% of GNI last year. The British Department for Foreign Aid and Development forced civil servants to go on a GBP 1 billion spending spree at the end of 2013 just to hit that target. We have food banks, a GBP 30 billion black hole in our NHS, potholes everywhere, a failing education system, underfunded police with bobbies being taken off the beat everywhere, thousands of policemen being taken away from service, and reduced bin collection – now fortnightly and, in some places, monthly. Libraries are closing, post offices are closing and street lights are being switched off. We can use that GBP 11.4 billion much better in the UK than giving it, in many cases, to dictators and people who squander it. My second point is that there is no guarantee that the aid that we give to some of the poor countries has had any lasting effect whatsoever. Some of the countries are still as poor as they were 20 years ago. I ask this institution to remove the barriers it has placed on these countries; remove the common fisheries policies from their shores and allow them to sell their goods at a rate that suits them. Increase the trade, decrease the aid and you will see that poorer countries will start to flourish.

One of the ideas for these innovative sources of funding may be the so-called microscopic solidarity contribution. Some companies plan to spend a certain percentage of their money on development aid from advertisers. Such initiatives have the opportunity to raise the necessary resources relatively quickly, which is extremely important if we want to continue our achievements in terms of health aid, access to education, hygiene, drinking water, the fight against malnutrition or environmental protection.

I commend and congratulate the rapporteur and the shadow rapporteurs once again for this excellent report. A number of important points have been raised here today, and I have taken good note of them.  Today’s discussion, along with the report, is a very welcome and useful contribution to our ongoing discussion with the Member States in order to finalise a compelling EU position ahead of this year’s conferences.   As confirmed by the Commission in our February communication, the Commission is of the opinion that the European Union should maintain its collective commitment to achieving the 0.7% of GNI target for ODA and should also commit to the 0.15-0.20% of GNI as the ODA target for the least developed countries. I believe the ODA commitment matters. It is important for our own development credibility, as well as for the success of the international conferences in Addis Ababa, New York and Paris this year.  At the same time, we must recognise that ODA alone will not be nearly enough to finance such a far-reaching, broad new global development agenda. Therefore we must envisage a new, more strategic and functional additional role for ODA by using it in a more catalytic manner to engage and leverage other financial and non-financial means of implementation that would suffice to cover such a demanding new SDG agenda.  I think that, above all, today’s debate has underlined that both the Commission and Parliament share a firm desire to ensure that the European Union plays a leading role in supporting the adoption and implementation of a truly transformative post-2015 agenda, by raising the global level of ambition. It is in this way that we should be able to claim that the European Union is not only the biggest player in global development cooperation, but also the best – the most effective – player.

In the European Union's position for the Conference on Financing for Development, there has been a certain lack of commitment to financial targets so far. And it is this lack of commitment to the financial targets and their timetable that we hope will be corrected, if possible at the next Council meeting. The political position that Parliament will vote on is in this direction and we hope that the Commission and the Council can take it into account.

Illegal capital outflows from developing countries amount to US$1 000 billion, which is 10 times the amount of official development assistance. It is therefore necessary to strengthen the ability of developing countries to collect taxes by strengthening the areas of tax administration, financial management and public finance management.

These agreements have been introduced with the support of this House as an instrument in our fight against cigarette smuggling, with the first one signed in 2004.  Then, and now, Parliament has been our key ally in the fight against cigarette smuggling, a criminal act that siphons away money from our budgets. We know the data: around EUR 10 billion are lost every year as a result of smuggling, which impacts primarily on our Member States but also on the EU budget. Just to put this in perspective, our 28 Member States in 2013 had fiscal income from legal cigarette sales of over EUR 90 billion. That means that because of this criminal activity they have lost more than 10% of income that would have benefited their citizens, and that makes fighting cigarette smuggling financially very important. We also recognise the negative impact on our public health policies. Legislative restrictions in the EU and national level prices are designed to deter smoking, and to protect citizens, especially youngsters. In contrast, illicit tobacco products are available, including to young people, at a substantial illegal discount. There is also a security dimension, since cigarette smuggling is one of the main sources of revenue for organised crime, and on 28 April we adopted a new European Agenda for Security, disrupting the access of organised crime to revenue from various smuggling activities, including the cigarette trade, which is part of this fight.  Parliament has strongly supported lifting this fight to a global level. Why? Because cigarette smuggling is a global phenomenon and therefore it requires a global solution. What we now have is the Protocol to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and I am very pleased to inform you that on 4 May the Commission adopted a decision proposing that the Council ratify it.  We do recognise, however, that ratification will take time. So far, out of the minimum requirement of 40 ratifications for the Protocol to enter into force we only have seven. In addition, even if we are to reach the 40 ratification requirement, we do not yet know whether the key sources and transit countries will actually sign up to the Protocol. I can assure you that we in the Commission take very seriously our role of encouraging exactly those countries to be amongst those ratifying in a timely manner.  We are also advancing a timely implementation of the Tobacco Products Directive. However, this Directive cannot play an effective role in controlling cigarette smuggling from outside the EU. It is in this context of the limitations, at this moment in time, on what we would like to pursue as the long-term solution that we are looking at other instruments at our disposal. One such instrument can also be the anti-fraud agreements with the major tobacco companies.  As I mentioned, the first was signed in 2004. It was with Philip Morris International (PMI). It will expire in July 2016. This agreement introduced innovative concepts like track and trace, due diligence – you need to know to whom you sell, you also have to make that information accessible – and anti-money laundering provisions. PMI agreed to pay USD 1.25 billion, of which slightly more than 90 % – 90.3 % – went to our Member States.  The agreement is legally binding and enforceable. Its contractual nature allows for elements to be included which would not have been easily available by legislative means, and in particular seizure payments without proof of fault. They offer an additional financial incentive to compliance. My predecessor, former Commissioner Šemeta, has already informed Parliament that we had brief exploratory meetings with PMI as required by the agreement, at which point PMI expressed interest in discussing a prolongation. We are also analysing the situation in light of evolving trends in illicit trade. We know that the cheap whites are our biggest threat now, not those that come from these big companies, and we are also looking at how the development in the regulatory landscape which I have already mentioned would impact our judgement on how to approach the future of this agreement. We are going to finalise an assessment in a couple of weeks and, of course, we will make it available to Parliament and the public. There are some facts that are very clear: that the main objective of the PMI agreement – to reduce the presence of smuggled PMI products on the EU black market – has been achieved. Between 2006 and 2014 the volume of illegal PMI products seized by Member States under the agreement dropped by 85% and that substantially exceeds the overall downward trend in seizures. This drop applies equally to both genuine and counterfeit PMI products. We are currently considering the next steps forward in this dossier, guided by our commitment to fight the illicit trade and serve the interests of our citizens. I want to state very clearly that we are very open on how we are going to end this, and in this sense my being here with you this evening is very important as an input that you will provide in our deliberations. I will keep you duly informed as we progress on this very important and very sensitive topic. I would like to end by thanking the Greens for their initiative, including Mr Geier, who I know is very interested in this matter.

However, it is our view that the negotiations between the Commission and the tobacco companies should be much more open and transparent. As it stands now, we have been allowed to view the documents in a secure reading room for a couple of hours, and this took place after a rather frustrating correspondence with her predecessor. As a matter of fact, it would require a specialist lawyer to understand anything that is in those papers.

Even better would be to invite us to the table as observers to monitor the reasoning of whether it would be good to prolong the agreements, for what reasons, and what we, as the Union, could achieve by prolonging these agreements. It is about taxpayers’ money, and at the moment there is a feeling among the public that they are being held as mere bystanders in what is potentially of huge importance financially and otherwise to them, as citizens of the Union.

We are in the field of combating the illicit trade in tobacco, smuggling and counterfeiting, a phenomenon which, as has rightly been raised, losses in national and European budgets of more than 10 billion per year. It also funds, when we fail to control it, criminal activities of all kinds and affects, of no other way, health, especially when it is uncontrolled. When we do not control its components, the product is also lowered on the market – because it is smuggled and counterfeit – and creates situations of uncontrollability and risk to our citizens in the context of this crisis. The agreements have generated and pooled resources and coordination to combat this smuggling on a global scale; therefore, in our group, for the new agreements that may be con reached — if so, since it is not yet decided — we want, in any case, to shed light on the results of what has already been done, with its pros and cons, to see whether or not they can really be useful in avoiding major ills and , in the area of budgetary control, also to establish as much control as possible in terms of criteria and conditions. As a Parliament, we want the fight against smuggling, illegal trade and counterfeiting of tobacco to remain at the most effective level; on the global level, it has to be like this. But as a group we also want to be able to follow step by step the Commission's dialogue with tobacco companies, as required by the Agreement and, above all, we want our opinion to dismiss all growing risks and avoid maximalist positions that cause greater ills.  We don't want to see again on the market, let alone in times of crisis, uncontrolled cigarettes of any kind. We are therefore left with the commitment you have just offered us: to see each other again once you have this report so that we can first form our opinion — we owe it to our citizens — which must have as its ultimate objective to preserve health, not only physical health , too and above all – but also the economic health of both the Member States and the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 100, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Martina DLABAJOVÁ", "mepid": "124709", "text": "  on the alde group. – Mr President, Commissioner, today's issue is a sector that is very sensitive, even controversial, and that is also the regulatory rules attached to it. On the one hand, especially in the last period, there is no general societal demand for the sector to grow and therefore access to it is mostly restrictive, coupled with an effort to cover the negative externalities associated with the pernicious impact on the health of the population. On the other hand, we attach some legitimacy to the sector and, once the conditions of controlled restriction have been met, we expect it to comply with the usual market rules, especially free competition. Moreover, the sector is the bearer of considerable sources of income in public finances. Combining these three points of view into one regulatory framework is not easy. At present, regulatory rules take a form in place that essentially meets the current societal need. However, they are not error-free and some parametric changes are required to enhance their functionality. In particular, the following three amendments can be mentioned: firstly, the setting up of a fair and transparent way of distributing funds obtained on the basis of fines collected from key tobacco producers. Secondly, enhancing the transparency and alignment of agreements concluded between the Commission and the four main producers, taking into account their content and time validity. It is legitimate to ask whether these four agreements have a real ability to minimise the problem and why they have different validity periods. There should also be information on their basic points. So we demand openness from you, Commissioner.  Thirdly, unfair manifestations of cigarette trafficking relate to other developments which are not affected at all by these agreements and, for some Member States, constitute a major market destruction, namely the influx of cigarettes of usually low quality, sold outside official markets and imported from third countries, particularly in the peripheral border regions of the European Union. Restrictions on these transactions are equally necessary, as their effects may be even more pernicious than in previous cases.

But despite this agreement and also the agreements with many other tobacco giants, such as Japan Tobacco, British American Tobacco and Imperial Tobacco Limited, smuggling still causes a yearly shortage of revenue, excise duties and VAT of some EUR 10 billion. That sum is obviously not going down, because I've been hearing that sum of 10 billion for years. In Parliament, as you know it, there are more and more critical voices on this agreement. The Dalli case is no stranger to that. Nor is the case of the former top civil servant Michel Petite, who has become a consultant in a law firm working for PMI, any such issue. The difficult debate and lobbying around the creation of the tobacco directive is no stranger to this. And so we in this House are demanding a general transparency of all the documents available on these tobacco agreements. As Mr Sarvamaa has already said, the way in which we must deal with this now is absolutely inadequate. We are asking ourselves a lot of questions about these agreements. After all, is it normal for us to start negotiations or talks with PMI, which at the same time is a company that is suing the European Union for the sake of the tobacco directive? That seems very strange to me. Moreover, is it in accordance with Article 5.3 of the World Health Organisation framework agreement that we simply have conversations with PMI?

I very much welcome the fact that the Commission is finally speaking out publicly after all the secrecy we have experienced on this issue for almost two or three years. To date, a crucial question remains unanswered, namely: what results has the agreement to date yielded? How have these agreements curbed smuggling with their own products? I would like to say that these agreements are not anti-fraud agreements. The question of what they are then is an important question. The documents we have seen, which I have seen, still show major gaps in the tobacco supply chain, and the systems are far from fraud-proof. Nor could I see that OLAF actually exerted pressure to change that. I was amazed by the donkey patience with which the office has proceeded, almost the lack of interest. Especially since the Office is no longer present at all in important places of cigarette smuggling – and you rightly pointed out that cheap whites are the bigger problem for us – namely in Kaliningrad or in China. With the debate with my National Front colleague, I really want to say that if Schengen had anything to do with it, or the EU, then we would not really have a problem with many places in the world. I would like to insist on the publication of all documents that do not concern trade secrets regarding track and trace or know your customer. These are extremely important stories in order to be able to evaluate the tobacco agreements. What we should publish are the reasonable expectations of tobacco companies, these are letters.

These are used to tackle illicit trade in tobacco and cigarettes and, of course, they actually benefit the tobacco companies as well because, without these agreements, these tobacco companies would be losing revenue, so there is an incentive for them to sign these agreements.  But this is also important for the EU and our Member States so that we can reduce the amount lost in customs and excise duties, and there are also the funds which are provided by the tobacco companies, as part of the agreement, to the EU and to Member States. Therefore, I would hope that the existing agreements will continue and those which are due to expire will be renewed as soon as possible. I would also say that we should not forget the health and security dimension of these agreements. It is important to restrict large amounts of cheap tobacco from coming onto the market for health reasons. It is also important to stop income from tobacco smuggling going to terrorist groups inside and outside of the European Union. So in view of that I would support us asking the Commissioner to produce an assessment of the effectiveness of the current arrangements, if not this month then hopefully at the June plenary session, and I am pleased that she did indicate in her contribution that that might be possible. Finally, I would also hope that Member States sign the protocol to eliminate illicit trade in tobacco products and cigarettes. I think this is important. This will allow us to tackle the problem not just inside the European Union but also the illicit trade coming to the European Union from outside. So I would urge Member States to ratify that particular protocol as soon as possible.

So I am a cheerful German Social Democrat, not a Green. When I have finished my speech, you will also see the difference between me and Mr Bové. Then, I believe, this will become a little clearer. I would like to draw attention to a point which has not yet played a role in the debate, which makes the fight against cigarette smuggling particularly important. Behind this are structures of organised crime. The stuff has to be introduced, it has to be distributed. The money collected in cash must be laundered, so the money must be returned to the money cycle. Cigarette smuggling, as is currently taking place in Europe, can only take place on the basis of organised crime. And this is a situation that undermines democracy and we cannot take it seriously enough. It is true that, in fact, the major dangers no longer come from the relevant cigarette brands, but the so-called cheap whites are now on the rise. In Berlin, for example, a brand that is not legally available at all in Germany now accounts for 25% of consumption. This also shows the extent to which this has taken place. The agreements are therefore certainly not the means of restricting smuggling, and we will have to do more to do so. It is also a question of the EU's commitment to ensure that EU representatives from OLAF also sit in key capitals of cigarette producing countries and contact the authorities there. I think this is particularly important, and it is really unacceptable that OLAF should only be represented in Kiev. This must be clearly developed. But the tobacco agreements are certainly a means of doing something else. I do not believe – as colleagues from the Greens and the Christian Democrat Group have called for – that we should stop the negotiations, not at all. What else should we do other than talk? We certainly cannot make any progress with appeals, so I am of a clear opinion: let them hit us where it hurts, namely with regard to money.

Any step we can take to reduce this danger is therefore welcome. This also applies to the fight against the illicit trade in cigarettes and tobacco. As a result, not only do we lose billions of euros in customs duties and taxes every year, but we are opening up space for further negative social phenomena. In some Member States, cheap illegal cigarettes lead to greater youth dependence on tobacco. And it is young people who should be protected the most. It is clear that profits from the illegal trade in cigarettes also help to finance the activities of organised crime groups. Perhaps no one therefore doubts that the best way to pay due attention to this serious problem must be found. That is why the European Parliament welcomed the conclusion of the current agreements in 2004. I am afraid that we cannot be so positive about the European Commission's current lax approach and procedure. Unfortunately, at the moment, relevant information is not available, which I think is very important for the future of these agreements, which the European Parliament must very forcefully demand. Above all, we do not yet know whether the agreements met the expectations that we put into them all those years ago.

The tobacco industry – the very one you mentioned from London – has a great interest in participating in this traceability system, and it is very interested in declaring as much contraband as possible and counterfeiting as little as possible. Because they have to pay for the counterfeits themselves and the contraband does not. That's how the system has been until now. This needs to be addressed.

I would like to apologise once again for mixing up people and parties. It was not intentional, and so I would also like to thank Mr Staes and Mr Geier for their contributions. Let me make five points today. This will be one step in an ongoing debate with the Parliament on this topic. My first point is that this House has my personal commitment on an engagement that allows us, together, to define what the role of this particular instrument is. As many have said, we need a broader approach that is not exhausted by this specific instrument, but we also have to decide on its role in the future. My second point is that in the differences in opinion, there was one issue on which almost everybody was of the same opinion – namely the necessity for more transparency so that, as we move forward, it is done in the form of an open discussion. Of course, to the extent that we can pursue transparency in that matter, we will do so. In other words, we are going to come to Parliament with ways in which Members’ participation in the deliberations can be active.  My third point is that there are no ongoing negotiations. None. There have been, as per the agreement, exploratory talks. These are required by the agreement with Philip Morris International. Two years before exploration, we need to look into the potential for prolongation. These talks have addressed one issue, namely whether there would be interest on the side of Philip Morris. They seem to be interested and we have also indicated on both sides that, before we move towards any step for or against negotiations, we need to complete our own assessments. Our assessment is ongoing. Once it is finalised, we will share it with Parliament. On that basis, we will make a decision on whether or not – of course, in consultation with the Council and Parliament – to go for a prolongation. Some of those here have spoken clearly in favour – some clearly, some cautiously, but saying that it is an instrument which still seems to be necessary – and there have been those speaking clearly against it. We obviously have to look at the costs and benefits before we come to any decision. That is something that we would do in an open and transparent manner. There will be no negotiations of which you are not aware, if at all, because that is – I repeat – an open question.  My fourth point is on a question that was posed to me, and I want to address it directly: does one have the right even to consider negotiations, given that the Protocol in relation to Article 5.3 of the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) calls on the parties to protect their public health policies from commercial or vested interests, and it actually says that you should not talk to these people or engage with them? This is the point that was made. I want to stress that the WHO Secretariat to the FCTC has issued guidelines on how they would wish to see that article implemented by the parties. These guidelines contain an explicit exemption for binding and enforceable agreements, such as these tobacco agreements. That is not to say that we should rush into a decision lightly, but rather that there is a clarifying document – the guidelines – that go with the Protocol. My fifth and last point is just a point of clarification on an independent laboratory. We agree that this is necessary. A number of Members pointed out the fact that, if the companies themselves are those who have the means to do all the assessments, then we are a bit blind. I confirm that we have taken a decision and we are pursuing having an independent laboratory that we can use.  With the assessment forthcoming, I just want to stress that there has been quite an impressive impact on reducing illicit trade. Just to give you a sense, we have had here a debate that has spread over about an hour and a half. In each minute of that hour and a half, 22 packs of illicit cigarettes have been seized. The volume is in the billions. These are cigarettes that are not put on our markets at a price below the regulatory one, are accessible to our young people, and are not in line with our health policies. This is taking money away from our treasuries. So there is clearly a benefit, but we also have to be mindful that we have an evolving regulatory context. I want to stress this. We now have the directive and we have the Protocol. We have to make every effort possible. I could not agree more with the speakers who have said that we should implement the directive and accelerate the ratification of the Protocol. That remains our bigger objective.

I would like to quote very briefly from a 2013 European Parliament resolution on the completion of the Digital Single Market. We have already expressly stressed in paragraph 51 that it is important to ensure that consumers do not encounter obstacles if they want to purchase electronic books across borders, platforms or devices. To date, the European Commission has not delivered much on this. Your comments, Mr Vice-President, have not reinforced the impression that you are on the verge of taking appropriate action. It is obvious, Mr Vice-President, that the reader of a book must pay the same VAT rate for this service, whether he is using it as a hard copy or as a digital service. It is simply not possible to explain why two different VAT rates are to be charged for this. That is why, on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I would like to make it quite clear that we should start as quickly as possible by examining the judgment that was given against France and Luxembourg in the light of equal treatment for comparable services in the European internal market and to move forward as soon as possible with a change in the VAT directive with a view to uniform taxation in the digital single market. Mr Vice-President, I would like to thank the Secondly, time is short, and I would like to come to the second point: not only is there a uniformity of taxation of various services, or, in the case, now necessary for a corresponding hard copy, but we must also urgently look for simplification opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, which are supposed to develop their home market in this digital internal market. That is why, in the digital age, I very much welcome the one stop shop for smaller companies in particular. Mr Vice-President, I would like to say to you that the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats will be on your side when it comes to negotiating with the 28 Member States what we can do to make these facilitations reach small and medium-sized enterprises in the end.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 146, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Neena GILL", "mepid": "4533", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, Commissioner Ansip acknowledges that by creating a connected digital single market, we can generate up to EUR 250 billion of additional growth in Europe, thereby creating hundreds and thousands of new jobs and a vibrant knowledge-based society. But Commissioner, to achieve this we do need several regulatory reforms and one of these is the tax treatment of digital products. I do support the need for alignment of VAT rates to ensure we have a level playing field and to eliminate distortion of competition, and tackling VAT fraud should remain a priority, but it is important not to forget the proportionality principle. So when on 1 January 2015 the new VAT rules on digital products sold in the EU came into force, which means that they are chargeable in the place of purchase rather than the place of supply, this resulted in many EU businesses having to register an account for VAT in every single Member State. I have been contacted by many new—tech SMEs which have been adversely affected and are on the point of closing down. So we do need to address this issue.  For example, in the UK, there are about 240 000 designers of knitting and sewing patterns which are sold as PDF downloads. They are struggling in terms of the cost of compliance, especially if they trade across borders. They face something like EUR 5 000 annually for each Member State. So I am not sure how we are going to achieve the digital single market if we have regulations like this. European SMEs also face distortions from VAT-free goods supplied by non-EU businesses.  So I welcome what you have said in terms of introducing legislation and simplifying measures, but I do think it is important that we get the right level of threshold that enables a higher number of digital start-ups, and that means exemptions for them.  There are some important issues, Commissioner, that you do have to address. How are you going to achieve a threshold given that you need the agreement of 28 Member States? Secondly, what will the level of the threshold be? In the UK, it is GBP 81 000, but I think we may need to go lower if we are to achieve our ambitions.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PSE"}, {"id": 147, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Mr President, I would like you all to imagine for a moment that you have just set up a small digital business. Perhaps you sell e—books or knitting patterns online. You have heard about the digital single market, and you are excited to think that you can sell to customers not only in your own country, but across the whole EU. You know that you need to register for VAT but when you look into it, you find that you need to keep accounts for up to 10 years and calculate up to 88 different VAT rates set by the countries you sell to. Someone tells you that you can automate the process, but you find the system either does not work, or that you have to sell through an online marketplace that charges you a large fee and may interrupt your sales process to sell other products to your customers.  So what do you do? Do you feel inspired by this new digital single market, or do you give up and shut up shop? Well, EU VAT Action and Enterprise Nation, who represent digital entrepreneurs, tell me that thousands of their members are closing down. So while the Commission champions the digital single market, EU rules since January 2015 are strangling digital businesses to death with red tape.  Now we all know that these rules are well-meaning and introduced to tackle abuses by multinational companies, so why do we not introduce a threshold – or even an exemption – a limit below which digital entrepreneurs could continue as before, and then when their businesses grow larger, bring them into this new system? Let us not forget that every large business started as a small business. Most great entrepreneurs started with nothing.

I have been doing a bit of digging, and sometimes that gives you funny results. For example, Commissioner, one of the first questions relating to the application of the higher VAT rate to e-books was introduced by Mrs Thyssen, who was then a Member of Parliament and who is now actually your colleague. Mrs Thyssen was very worried about the higher VAT rates on, I quote, ʽbooks published on CD-Rom or DVDʼ. Now that was in 2009 – the Commission has not even started to think about solutions but CD-Roms are no longer used for e-books.  So the key words here are speed and urgency. Because I have also submitted a series of questions over the years, and in the answer to one of my questions in 2013 the Commission replied that it ʽis currently examining this issueʼ – blah di blah di blah – ʽand these elements will be taken on board in completing the impact...ʼ. In other words, already back in 2013 the Commission was looking into it.  So what are you waiting for? The digital market, as you well know Commissioner, is developing much more rapidly than this. We are legislating at Flintstone speed but the digital market is moving on. It is not waiting for us, and if you say 2016, well by then so many small businesses will have gone down already because they cannot survive.  Why does the Commission have to wait until 2016? Why cannot you just start tomorrow? If, Commissioner, you go back to the Commission and to the Member States and tell them that we need action now, I think that the whole Parliament will back you up because everybody here is echoing the same message.

However, because there is no threshold, the real impact is that the smallest companies and sole traders are going to be left unable to compete and they are going to face the stark reality of having to close their businesses down in some instances. Moreover, it creates a divide between multinational companies, who can very easily put in place systems to comply with the new rules, and those small traders and small businesses that simply cannot do so.

We are therefore in favour of a reduced VAT rate for digital goods and services such as e-books as early as 2015, therefore, the European VAT Directive. We think it is right that, as is currently the case, VAT on such purchases should be paid in the Member State of destination of the purchaser, but we also believe that this rate must be uniform throughout the Territory of the European Union.  The latter is a necessary condition for the rapid elimination of problematic geoblocking, so some content is available in some Member States and in others it is not. Geoblocking, as things stand at present, is the only way in which some companies, especially smaller ones, medium-sized enterprises and start-ups, can avoid dealing with 28 different VAT systems. Today's debate is an opportunity to highlight the urgent need to move towards a reduced uniform rate as soon as possible, therefore, for digital services, e-books, books and newspapers.

Nevertheless, this observation should not obscure the real problem which is the constant decline in reading in Europe. This issue of reviving reading is taking its place in this debate, but I remain convinced that the reduction of VAT for e-books is not the appropriate solution to the problem posed. As such, the 2006/112/EC Directive, which states that reduced rates cannot be applied on digital services, must be maintained as it stands because a planned reduction in VAT in this sector will undermine a whole part of our economy, i.e. bookstores, particularly independent ones, and the indirect jobs that result from them, in printing and publishing. I have seen this recently in my country, France, with the liquidation of Chapter bookstores and the loss of more than 500 jobs. This reduced VAT rate only favours large US multinationals such as Amazon and Google, leaders in this digital market, which practice tax optimization in Europe and thus create unfair competition. The real questions we must ask ourselves today are simple: how can reading in Europe be revived? What means do we have to support our bookstores and sustain thousands of jobs?

When these problems are eliminated by the judiciary and the court, absurd situations often occur. An example is the case of the relationship between printed books and e-books, where different mediums, different information carriers are taxed differently. I would like you, Vice-President of the Commission, to see this case as an example of how exceptions do not work and the complex tax system does not work. If you are talking about the Commission preparing a definitive VAT regime, then you should learn from this case. Because the problem, in my opinion, is not in the decision of the Court of Justice of the European Union. I've read the verdict, and I think the verdict is the right one. The problem is in the directive, which vaguely and vaguely regulates exceptions. We should therefore talk about if exceptions, as they are to be defined, and if so, to the smallest extent possible.

Well, this is of the utmost importance to my country, the Hungarian businesses, because so far they have been at a huge disadvantage, because they were only able to provide services at the highest VAT rate in the Union, i.e. 27%, and everyone else was, of course, cheaper than them. However, in addition to drawing attention to the issue of overtrawing in itself, there are two other things that are at risk here. Hopefully, a European tax union will solve all this, but until we get there, we are facing two dangers here. One is that the idea of a 'mini one-stop shop' seems very good, but it is important to pay attention here to the fact that individual operators do not, say, collect the highest national tax rate. This is important because, for some services, this does not make such a striking difference.

I do not know if you are aware that traders who trade across borders account for more than 60 VAT regimes. Because not only VAT is different in every country, but every product is different.  In this way, we move on to the publication of books or other content, such as magazines, newspapers – on paper or in electronic form. This is another barrier for producers, for publishers and for authors, which does not increase the level of readership, another barrier that virtually all consumers in the Member States complain about, as well as those who trade in these books – and today it is no longer possible to separate paper content from electronic content. If we don't deal with this topic right away, there may soon be other media in the area that we're talking about. Content is important and it is important that a European can get to know this content as openly as possible. I therefore call once again: agreeing to a common VAT in the European Union, agreeing to this between Member States should be an absolute priority for us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 160, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Pervenche BERÈS", "mepid": "1985", "text": "   Mr President, Commissioner, if your predecessors had listened to this European Parliament, we would not be here.

Just two weeks ago, he presented his long-awaited and much-hyped digital single market strategy. The proposals, 16 of which are to be delivered in the next five years, are a step in the right direction. But they are by no means a silver bullet. As we have heard this evening, not all proposed initiatives seem to be working for SMEs and micro businesses. In fact, my Labour colleagues and I have received, and keep receiving, hundreds of e—mails from our constituents saying that the changes introduced from 1 January 2015 on new place of supply VAT rules, as well as the abolition of the UK threshold, which was GBP 81 000 in sales per year before people and businesses were eligible to pay VAT, have caused more obstacles when selling abroad rather than helping to eliminate them. The Mini One-Stop Shop, the VAT MOSS, was set up in order to aid businesses when selling abroad. How can they adjust their prices accordingly if they do not know what the VAT regime is in the country they are selling to?  Commissioner, in your digital market strategy, there is a mention the Commission will make legislative proposals in 2016 to introduce a common EU-wide VAT threshold to help small businesses; but by the time it becomes law, we could well be in 2017 or 2018. What do we do to help businesses in the meantime? The current legislation was designed and agreed back in 2006. However, that is almost a decade ago. I was pleased to hear what you said about e-books and the treatment of e-books in relation to printed books. Currently, printed books have a special privilege and are taxed at a reduced rate between zero and 10% across the Union. E-books are considered a digital service, even if they are actually only a book in a different format, and they are taxed at a rate between 18% and 25% across the EU. So I welcome your comments, but I would like to see the proposals on that fairness between the virtual and non-virtual coming sooner rather than later, so that consumers across the EU can benefit from your action.

Commissioner, I am not sure if you are the right member of the Commission for this issue that we have with VAT. I can see the UK has a lot of problems with it; other countries are happy about the changes because smaller countries are sometimes at a disadvantage when there is competition in relation to taxation and VAT rates.  It is a very complex situation, and we tend to make things very complex in Europe, unfortunately. I would suggest something though, which is to change the name ‘e-book’ into simply ‘DC’ (digital content). We should just change it to DC because we no longer know what a book is or what it becomes, and once you open it up you have live content and you are doing something else with it. So let us start thinking ahead of the curve, forget the past and see where these things will be in the future. The future will be a digital content single market. We need to be proactive and not reactive. I know the Commissioner is himself, so I would say: be brave; make very simple decisions to simplify Europe – for businesses to understand how things work. Whatever the tax is, make it very easy so that they can pay it easily and not have to close down. That is all it is about.

For example, books downloaded from the Internet are already considered a service. I'm afraid that any exceptions we create in this area will only complicate the system.

But now we need to translate these commitments into real initiatives, and do so quickly. This is the message that this Parliament is unanimously sending to the Commission this evening, because the digital single market is the real challenge facing the European Union in the near future, perhaps only to the creation of the single market. Digital can be the key through which Europe regains competitiveness and innovation, but it also plays a central role in the world cultural sphere. We cannot think of working towards this goal unless we see effective actions to break down anachronistic barriers such as the permanence of a different VAT between a paperback and a digital book. This debate is fundamental for the European Union because we are not discussing a technical issue, but about culture, the future, the promotion and concrete implementation of unity in diversity, which is our DNA as European citizens. We look to the future but we are held back by laces and laces that belong to a bygone era and we have to cut them in order to move forward.

On the contrary, this is a solution which makes the life of companies easier: a company may register and settle its VAT in one country through one platform and while contacting only one administration instead of having to deal with 28 administrations.  It is, moreover, a solution that is optional for taxpayers; nobody is forced to use it. No better mechanism has been developed until now that makes the registration and settlement of VAT issues in trans-border transactions easier. Besides, VAT MOSS is only four months old and it is still being improved. The Commission has already started to assess the effectiveness of the VAT MOSS platform.  The new VAT rules may indeed be problematic for some companies. Let us emphasise however that the Directive on the Place of supply of services was approved by all Member States and this Parliament.

I share the criterion of equal tax treatment, with a reduced VAT rate, for books, whatever their format, in the name of the digital single market, but even more so, in the name of culture conceived as a general interest. It would be a difficult paradox to understand, let alone accept, for us to move forward on downside tax equality for all kinds of books and continue to be silent in the face of fiscal policies with serious and direct negative discrimination for culture as a whole, all while large digital operators enjoy, in fact, super-reduced taxation close to zero.

I would like to reflect on your question, Sophia, on why I am here and why Pierre Moscovici is not here. Pierre Moscovici is right now in the Bundestag in Berlin and this is the reason why I am here, but I think that both of those issues are directly related to the digital single market and this is the reason why I had to be here. Both those issues have a very long history but, as you said, there is a common understanding in the Commission that both of those issues are urgent issues. So let us talk about MOSS reform.  In 2004, our small and medium-sized companies were complaining because there was no fair competition. For big companies, for global players, it was so easy to remove their headquarters to countries where tax rates were at a very low level, and in this way our small and medium-sized companies were just out of the competition. That is why this reform was made. The decision was made in 2008 already. But, during those debates between 2004 and 2008, it was proposed by the Commission to set a threshold at quite a high level, under which our small and medium-sized companies did not have to declare their VAT revenue; and it was rejected by Member States.  This is one of those reasons why many people, many entrepreneurs, complained, and this is once again, according to my understanding, the reason why we had to propose to set this threshold for our micro-companies at quite a high level once again. I have stated it publicly many times already: according to my understanding, we proposed setting this threshold at the level of EUR 100 000, as it was during the years 2004 to 2008, and I think that our Member States were able to understand why this is so important for our small businesses. Talking about e-books, the decision was made in 2001 already not to allow those reduced VAT rates to be applied on e-services like e-books. Why is this question an urgent issue right now? It is because of this decision we had from the European Court of Justice just last year and we had to act. As President Jean-Claude Juncker stated already, we would like to propose to allow those reduced rates also to be used on e-books. We will get a report about the VAT MOSS this summer already, and on the basis of this report we can say when we will be able to make our proposals that change our legislation. So the Commission is acting already and I promise that I will do my utmost to make those proposals as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 186, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

I hold the view that this not only distorts fair competition, discourages SMEs and e-commerce but also makes digital goods much more difficult and expensive for EU consumers to access. Hence, I think that there is a great practical need to have a uniform VAT regime in the EU. Moreover, I believe that the derogations and reduced VAT rates should be applied for digital books, journals and magazines as they are now already applied for the printed books (their physical counterparts) due to being classified as cultural goods. This would not only benefit producers and consumers but could have a positive impact on the development of digital information base, research and innovation.

In this context, a reduced VAT rate for digital media is to be pushed, i.e. the VAT rate should be technology-neutral.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow we will be voting on an own-initiative report by the European Parliament which aims to increase patient safety in health care and the objective of combating with all possible energy the great threat posed by the growth of resistance to antimicrobial agents.  If we refer to patient safety, the ECDC states that around 10 % of those admitted to hospital suffer damage or adverse events that must be avoided.  We have tried to identify the causes of all this and, consequently, to take the most appropriate action to prevent medical errors and the risk of hospital infections.  I would therefore like to mention some of the most important points: the elimination of political interference in the appointments of managers and health professionals, including the practice of the Spoil System, first of all, and the abolition of economic austerity measures, because we cannot endorse those measures that have an impact on patient safety, such as the reduction of medical staff or staff specialising in hygiene.  If we are talking about the increase in antimicrobial resistance, we must remember that 25 000 EU citizens die each year as a result of this cause, and the figures are set to soar, both in terms of human lives and in terms of economic costs. It should also be remembered that an increasing number of animals are infected with antimicrobial resistant bacteria and that this poses a risk in the consumption of animal meat. I will cite just a few of these measures: the importance of a commitment by the pharmaceutical industry to a genuine search for new antimicrobial drugs and at the same time the openness to research into new natural methods of combating pharmacoresistance; the ban on online sales; the elimination of prophylactic use and the strong limitation of metaphylactic use in the veterinary sector. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs from all the political groups who have contributed constructively to the drafting of this own-initiative report and, finally, I am proud to be able to point out that this report also represents a first real application of democracy directed at the European Parliament, because it has involved some citizens who have proposed their amendments online, which were then voted on and included in the final text that you will be voting on tomorrow.

On patient safety, I am glad to see that the report, while recognising the progress made so far, seeks to go further and do more for the safety of citizens. I also welcome the call for enhanced cooperation with stakeholders in the interests of a coordinated, comprehensive and sustainable EU approach to patient safety. This call is in line with the Council Conclusions on patient safety and quality of care adopted on 1 December 2014 under the Italian Presidency. The proposed report also rightly underlines the importance of having sufficient health professionals, including in hospital settings, with the right skills and up-to-date knowledge.  Turning to antimicrobial resistance (AMR), I would like to underline how important it is that antibiotics be dispensed only under prescription, and that treatment with antibiotics is based on proper diagnosis. AMR knows no borders and can spread between humans, animals, the environment and food. The cost to human and animal health is high, as is the direct impact on our economies. All this points to the urgent need for coordinated efforts to combat AMR. For many years, this issue has been a priority for the Commission. In 2011, we launched the five-year Action Plan based on the ‘One Healthʼ concept, involving all sectors and aspects of antimicrobial resistance.  Three and a half years later, we can be proud that important progress has been made in Europe and that the Action Plan has contributed to increasing international awareness about this serious worldwide public health concern.

The reasons are complex, including an increase in the average age of workers, a lack of supplies and an increase in the needs of an ageing society for care. Hungary, the real problem for The European Union and several other new Member States is the exodus of health workers. In Europe, we are witnessing a reverse labour dumping: the old Member States are promising to attract specialists, nurses and social workers from the new Member States abroad, promising salaries of 5-10 times, causing serious security of supply problems in the countries concerned. As it is not expected that the Member States most affected by the exodus will be able to raise the salaries of health workers to a similar level in a short period of time, it is essential that the European Commission takes priority in addressing the problem.

I am nevertheless very pleased to be able to give a brief introduction to the European Parliament's initiative report on green growth opportunities for SMEs at this late hour. First of all, I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and also the secretariat of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy for their good cooperation.  Green growth is about exploiting the opportunities that help make the transition to a more sustainable economy. It is very simple to me: if we all continue to consume as we do today, we will need 40% more water and energy in the next 20 years. At that rate, we also need three times more natural resources by 2050. It is therefore important that we let a mind shift take place. We need to make the transition to a more sustainable, more efficient, but also low-carbon economy. We must also ensure that our policies create the right conditions so that companies can innovate, invest and remain competitive.  At present, the world market for environmental goods and services accounts for around EUR 1000 billion per year. It is estimated that this could double or even triple by 2020, and the green economy continued to grow during the economic crisis. Europe is showing leadership here in terms of recycling and energy efficiency, and the stakes are therefore on how we can strengthen and maintain that leadership. That is also the use of my report. At the same time, it sums up the opportunities offered by the green economy, but on the other hand the report highlights a number of problems that SMEs face if they want to invest and go along with the story of the green economy and the circular economy.  Because I have been able to speak to a lot of companies and entrepreneurs personally and a number of things always came back. The search for good funding, the red tape they face, but also the knowledge needed to invest in this domain. It is therefore imperative that business leaders become more familiar with alternative ways of financing, such as venture capital, but also crowdfunding. We need to get rid of the idea that our economy can only be financed by debt and by banks.  It's also about knowledge management. It is also about the fact that business leaders need to be given knowledge and access to knowledge in order to innovate, but also that the right information flows to the field. Entrepreneurs need to keep up to date with new technological developments, and the role of sector federations in this is particularly important. They can really guide their members and help them get to the latest technology, the latest financing opportunities and also share knowledge with each other.  Research and development, innovation must continue to be stimulated in order to remain the market leader, but also to find new applications in the green economy. It is not so much a question of granting additional subsidies, because only 9% of new companies use subsidies, but it is important to look at how we can make a good combination of available financial resources and the innovation that is sought.  If I look at the Belgian situation, it is also about us adapting the legislation. 65% of European legislation was made at a time when the Internet was not a significant factor, for example, so we must also ensure that our legislation is future-proofed. These disruptive ideas need a framework that allows development, which pushes development further than it does today.  We must also dare to look at ourselves. We must also dare to look at how we can make our legislation more transparent, clearer, also lighter, sometimes to give new opportunities, to give new businesses every opportunity to remain competitive. This will ensure the return of growth in Europe. This will create new jobs and will ultimately lead to a greater well-being of our citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 235, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Paul RÜBIG", "mepid": "2278", "text": "   Mr President, I would like to thank the I would also like to congratulate Mr De Backer, because it is, of course, precisely this report that is of particular importance for our future in Europe.

So Greece's heavy industry, tourism, cannot be hit by the increase in VAT. You understand that we will have the opposite effect: increasing VAT in a country that is really poor and has one and a half million unemployed will lead to greater poverty. That is why we must have zero VAT on basic foodstuffs in order for the Greek people to survive.

I really want to congratulate Mr De Backer on this report because the Green Action Plan is at the heart of the Commission’s priorities – the transformation of EU industry through innovation and modernisation with the involvement of SMEs. Resource efficiency is one of the drivers for industrial transformation with positive effects on the environment. Europe has much to gain, as has already been said: up to EUR 630 billion per year in resource savings.  Our starting point is good. Eco-industry and eco-innovation currently supply one third of the global market for green technologies. But let me point to a few issues also indicated in the report. One point is that 75% of SMEs in the EU have seen an increase in their costs of materials in the past five years.  My second point is that, in manufacturing SMEs, raw materials – and this is really important – represent on average 40% of total costs, with energy and water pushing this up to 50%. This compares, for example, to a share of 20% for labour costs.  The third point is that reducing energy consumption is a priority for 80% of medium-sized companies. Finally – and this point was also made by Mr Šoltes – SMEs find it difficult to get value from their waste. We are very pleased to see that the rapporteur and the Commission have identified similar challenges and proposed similar actions, specifically in the areas of improving financing, facilitating innovation and strengthening cross-sectoral collaboration and knowledge transfer, in particular to clusters. On access to finance, which is a key priority for the Commission, we will work to ensure complementarity between different EU sources. The Commission is currently working on an ambitious package to pave the way towards a circular economy. The Green Action Plan for SMEs is intended to enable SMEs to turn this challenge into real business opportunities. We welcome your support for the forthcoming European Resource Efficiency Excellence Centre, which will provide information and advice on the performance and cost-effectiveness of different resource-efficient options, directly and through partners to SMEs. We want to reach as many SMEs as possible. Knowledge sharing among the Centre, the renewed Enterprise Europe Network and European clusters will be instrumental in this. Clusters are catalysts for SME cooperation and, by putting SMEs at the centre of such collaboration in our call under the Horizon 2020 programme, clusters can contribute to Europe’s industrial transformation in a more resource-efficient economy. Once again I would like to thank you very much for the valuable input of your Assembly on this topic. I really look forward to continuing our dialogue in the future for the benefit of all European SMEs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 241, "date": "2015-05-18.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "   The debate is closed.

In this context, the key driver of economic and sustainable growth is SMEs, which make up more than 98% of European businesses and which are important to enable them to use environmental challenges to make the most of the economic opportunities they have.  Furthermore, it has been established that, still, mainly highly developed SMEs are those that create green innovation, but other companies also need to adapt to environmental regulations. In order to achieve such a result, it is necessary to start from deregulation. In particular, it is necessary for Member States, through the revision of existing legislation and by reducing over-regulation, to remove barriers to the internal market. On the other hand, it is also essential that the European Commission focuses its efforts towards innovation-friendly legislation. Such adjustments and changes must of course be accompanied by various measures and supports, such as for easier start-ups, and concrete and realistic funding and lending models in order to actually deliver and fully implement green initiatives.
