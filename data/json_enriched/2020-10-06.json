The European Parliament wrote the latest report of this kind in 2018 but it did not write one last year because of the European elections. I therefore focus on the recent developments in the two last years and I look to the future, because this is also the input to the Commission’s trade policy review and to the incoming Trade Commissioner.  The report covers ongoing negotiations, implementation of free trade agreements, WTO issues, relations with the US, China, the UK and other important partners, as well as SMEs, trade and sustainable developments and digital trade and services. This report is also our response to the COVID-19 crisis. My main message here is that of European competitiveness, that this is not the time for protectionism. The response to a decline in trade due to the crisis shouldn’t be political control of companies’ value chains. Instead, rules-based free trade is even more important now and we must diversify our value chains, not shorten them.  This is the way forward to secure our resilience, supply and growth, and trade agreements play an important role in this. And we need to remove trade barriers. Export restrictions on the internal market are unacceptable; so are those to third countries.  In the last few years, we have closed trade deals with Canada, Japan, Singapore and Vietnam. We need to finish deals with Mercosur, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Taiwan, to mention a few. We must resolve trade disputes with the US, no matter who sits in the White House and we need the US by our side, not least to handle unfair competition from China, and we need close ties to the UK.  With this report we, the European Parliament, take our position for the future. We push back protectionism and pave the way for a competitive Europe.

Mr President, we want a stronger Europe to shape a better world. Less dependence, more influence. That's why our last European Council focused on strengthening Europe, both within our borders and beyond our borders. We discussed how to reinforce our common house. Strategic autonomy and open economies are the centrepiece. We also addressed measures for the first issues and took key decisions. We had a comprehensive debate on the situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and our relationship with Turkey. A more stable and predictable Eastern Mediterranean region is in our strategic interest and we are united towards Turkey. We have agreed on a two—track approach: firmness and readiness to engage. EU solidarity with Cyprus and Greece is unwavering. Sovereignty and sovereign rights must be respected. We welcomed the start of a confidence-building dialogue between Greece and Turkey and we strongly condemned violations of the sovereign rights of the people of Cyprus. More steps are needed in that direction.  We call on Turkey to accept the invitation by Cyprus to engage in dialogue to settle all maritime—related disputes and we support the speedy resumption of UN—led negotiations and we remain fully committed to a comprehensive settlement of the Cyprus problem within the UN framework. Many issues need to be discussed, like the sharing of revenue from hydrocarbons. In case of renewed unilateral actions or provocations in breach of international law, we'll use all the instruments at our disposal to defend our interests and those of our Member States. But, of course, our preference is to engage in a positive EU—Turkey agenda with a focus on, for instance, the modernization of the customs union and trade facilitation, people—to—people contact, high—level dialogues and continued cooperation on migration issues.  It's not just about Turkey. There are conflicts, disputes and many overlapping challenges across the Eastern Mediterranean, and that's why I have proposed a multilateral conference on the Eastern Mediterranean. We call for a multilateral conference on the Eastern Mediterranean and we invite the High Representative to engage in talks about its organisation. This conference could address issues that need multilateral solutions, including maritime delimitations, security, energy, migration and economic cooperation.  On Belarus, our goals are clear: first, to end the repression and the violence against the opposition and the population; second, to allow the people of Belarus to decide on their future without interference. This means an inclusive national dialogue, which could be facilitated by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and those responsible for the violence must be held to account. We, therefore, took the decision on sanctions, which was immediately implemented.  We condemn the assassination attempt on Alexei Navalny with a military chemical nerve agent and we call on the Russian authorities to fully cooperate with the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ensure an impartial international investigation to bring those responsible to justice. We will revert to this issue in two weeks. Concerning Nagorno-Karabakh, we call for a cessation of hostilities and the resumption of peaceful negotiations. External interference, military in particular, is unacceptable.  We now have a clear strategy towards China. We want to remain engaged with China. China is a major partner in addressing global challenges like climate change or COVID—19. We welcome China's recent commitment to carbon neutrality by 2060. We have encouraged China to take this path. China is also a key trading partner, but we want a more balanced relationship, with a level playing field and greater reciprocity. We expect our negotiations on the investment agreement to conclude successfully by the end of this year. On human rights, we will not paper over our differences, especially the rights of minorities and the rule of law like in Hong Kong. Ladies and gentlemen, this European Council was also an opportunity to look at the strategic autonomy of the European Union, in relation to an open economy. This has enabled us to affirm our ambition to work together, not only to repair the internal market, damaged by the Covid-19 crisis, but above all to improve the functioning of this internal market, which is a central value at the heart of the European project.  This was an opportunity to assert strong and ambitious directions in the digital field, after the climate field. These two major transitions are fundamental levers for successful transformation of the economic and social project at the European level.  We want to be a digital leader, we want to accelerate the necessary transformations, which means investing and equipping ourselves, especially through the regulatory capacity inspired by our values Fundamental. The heart of the matter is not only the economy, it is also the values and the type of digital model that we want. That is why we are totally convinced of the way forward: we must be more resilient, better able to guide our destiny by enshrining it in our commitment to multilateralism and the open economy, and maintain the ambition of a stronger Europe for a fairer world and a more committed world. With regard to Covid-19, there is a need to improve cooperation between Member States because, both in terms of testing, international travel and quarantine rules, cooperation and coordination between Member States are very perfect. There are plans to come back very regularly on this subject and to ask both the Commission and the Member States, through the Council, to be extremely committed. The issue of vaccines was also discussed. This was an opportunity for the Commission to present a precise picture of the progress of the decisions that were taken. This is to ensure that, when available, vaccines can be made available fairly and equitably in Europe. So that the issue of distribution and priorities can be clarified between us and that we can also fully assume our responsibility at the international level, because this vaccine is a common good, that this challenge is a global challenge and it is not just a matter of getting by on its own. As the European Union, we must also support our partners in making progress on this issue. In conclusion, I would say that, in the political, democratic and institutional process and with the forthrly multi-year budget and this exceptional stimulus fund, we must give the European Union the resources to act and implement what we believe in in in the years to come.  We will continue in good faith, in dialogue and with mutual respect, to work and negotiate with you, Parliament, so that we can come up with decisions and solutions as quickly as possible, move forward, assume our responsibilities and meet the expectations of the 450 million European citizens as well as those around the world who are convinced that this European project is a necessary added value.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 4, "date": "2020-10-06.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, let me address this House today on behalf of the Commission’s President, Ursula von der Leyen.  As you are well aware, she is still in self-isolation today after participating in a meeting attended by a person who tested positive for coronavirus, and as the President has said, we have to be careful and do our utmost to reduce the spread of the virus.  Now, if you will allow me, turning to the topic at hand – the European Council – President Michel has debriefed you on the very substantial discussion on foreign affairs. I would sum it up very simply: we at the Commission are very glad that the European Council has finally found unity after a very long debate, because when we are united we have the power to address the many challenges that surround our European Union. Today, I would like to focus on two issues from the European Council where our unity will be needed and will be tested again: our climate and digital goals, and Brexit.  First, on our climate goals, which will be at the core of the next European Council. This Parliament and Europe’s heads of state and government have agreed on making Europe the first climate neutral continent by 2050.  For that, we need to speed up. If we continued with business-as-usual, we would only cut our emissions by 60% by 2050, and that’s too little to contain global warming and its devastating impact. That is why the Commission proposes to increase our climate ambition for 2030. We propose a reduction of at least 55% by 2030 compared to 1990. It is an ambitious goal, but it is within our reach.  There is an economic rationale for 55%. Our cost—benefit analyses tell us that the benefits are bigger than the costs. Science tells us that we have no choice. The Paris Agreement requires it. And the public consultation we have conducted shows that a very large majority of Europeans expect this from us, including in the business sector. They all observe the increase in extreme weather conditions.  Businesses want to invest in green innovation, but they also want certainty and predictability. Do we have a plan to realise the increased ambition? Yes, we do. We have policies and rules in place that have delivered CO2 reductions in the past while growing our economy. The emissions trading system coupled with other rules and mechanisms is proving its effectiveness.  We can and will propose by June 2021 an upgrade for our policy toolbox to become ‘fit for 55’ in the most cost—efficient and innovation—enhancing manner. This will be underpinned again by impact assessments for Member States and economic sectors.  The second question is: do we have the resources to finance the higher climate ambitions? Yes, we do.  The next EU budget and Next Generation EU will make available more than EUR 600 billion for climate and green investment. This investment from the EU level should leverage a multiple of this in further private and public investment that will support the transition, and this includes investment for a fair transition.  Then we have to ask: do we have allies in this task? Yes, we do.  President Michel just made reference to the fact that, at the UN General Assembly two weeks ago, President Xi announced that China aims to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, and that it will peak its CO2 emissions before 2030. The same with the President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa, who declared that his country will aim at carbon neutrality by 2050. These are messages we want to hear and we need more of them. Europe will not solve climate change alone. We represent less than 10% of global CO2 emissions, but we are not alone and this is good news for the world. But it also means that we must preserve our ‘first—mover’ advantage. We must step up our climate ambition if we want the best green technologies to be European technologies.  So the question that remains is: do we have the resolve?  If you look around us, we are heading from the wildfire season straight into the flood season, and I want to appreciate President Sassoli’s remarks and expression of solidarity with the floods which took place just this weekend in Italy and France. Is this the world we want to live in? A world of never—ending natural disasters? A constant increase in desertification? Now it is the question for you, for the European Parliament, to unite around an ambitious climate objective of at least 55% by 2030. And we will push for Europe’s heads of state and government to unite behind the same ambition before the end of the year. The Commission wants it to be our common goal to deliver the European Union’s nationally determined contribution by the end of 2020, a date that marks the fifth anniversary of the Paris Agreement.  The green transition goes hand in hand with the digital one. Like for the green transition we need clear objectives for the next decade. Just like with our 2030 climate goals, Europe needs to up its game. This is how the 2020s can become Europe’s digital decade. Last week’s European Council recognised that need, calling for a digital compass to navigate this transformational period and has concluded to invest 20% of the Recovery and Resilience Facility in digital projects.  That investment will support and profit from our actions in three fields: First, we must establish a true digital single market through firm enforcement of the rules we already have, and we must deepen it in fields such as digital services.  Second, fair competition. We need new tools to address the power of global tech platforms over small European companies and to respond to global subsidy races. That’s why we will propose a digital service act in December of this year, and a foreign subsidies instrument in early 2021. Third, we must build up the digital capacity of our industries, and for this we need European flagships and alliances, for instance on secure 5G networks, low energy data processing and quantum computing.  In parallel to this, we must also better serve citizens and businesses through digital public services and common European digital identity.  All this requires major investment which Next Generation EU can drive. Next Generation EU is our opportunity to deliver. Let’s use it! Finally, we will need all our energy in this final stage of negotiations with the United Kingdom. We are less than 100 days away from the end of the transition period. There are two tracks to which we should devote our full attention and energy. The ongoing negotiations on our future partnership, which are tough, and the full and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement, which I have the honour to oversee.  This Agreement guarantees our citizens’ rights, our financial interests, the integrity of the single market – and crucially – the Good Friday Agreement. The fact that our British friends now, all of a sudden, propose the draft bill that, by its very nature, is a breach of this Withdrawal Agreement is a heavy blow to the British signature and reliability.  Respecting agreements is first a matter of law, but also of trust and of good faith, and this is why last week the Commission started an infringement procedure by sending a letter of formal notice to the UK Government. We invited them to submit their observations by the beginning of November. The full and timely implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement is simply not debatable.  Concerning the negotiations on our future partnership, Prime Minister Johnson and President von der Leyen took stock of the negotiations last Saturday. They both agreed that some progress had been made but that a lot remains to be done.  We all know where the difficulties are. We all know our mandate, our red lines, our objectives. Our negotiators were instructed to work as hard as they can to try to finalise an agreement. Michel Barnier and his team have, as always, our full trust. But time is short.  In case we reach an agreement, which is our objective, both parties will have to ensure ratification in time for an entry into force by 1 January 2021, and this will need some time, including time for this House.  If this is not the case, we will be in the ‘no-deal’ territory. Given that we are less than 100 days away from this date, we cannot exclude this scenario. This is why we will continue to work with you and the Member States to ensure that we are ready for every scenario.  This is a delicate moment for Europe. The Brexit deadline looms. The pandemic is still with us. It is a moment of uncertainty, so it must be the moment of unity. The moment of courage.  Long live Europe.

Tomorrow, after a successful hearing in the committees, we will vote on one new commissioner and one commissioner who is changing portfolio. I remind us of this because it's a historic moment: it's the first time we have the chance to achieve a really gender-balanced Commission, and I think that is a good thing. I promised citizens this during the campaign, as did a lot of other politicians; we are making it now and that is good for Europe. Now for the daily assessment of last week's Council. Again, the glass is half-full and half-empty; that's the principle of the Council. Half-full, because we have concrete sanctions against those who are responsible for violence and torture in Belarus. That's good, but, on the other hand, Lukashenko is not on the list. Please explain to us why the brain of the whole system is not on the list. Second, we have Greece, Cyprus and Turkey. Greek and Cypriot interests are European interests. There's no doubt about this. We use strong words and have a clear strategy, but still, the glass is half-empty. I think we cannot explain to citizens all over Europe that we are still negotiating with Turkey about enlargement, about Turkey's full membership of the European Union. So, once again, small steps, right direction, but no clear signal. Good compromise but no leadership. Once again, that's the outcome of the Council. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The biggest concern that concerns me at the moment is what is going on in our economy.  It is a question of substance: 15 million unemployed on this continent. In Spain, 40% of the young generation that has no jobs. France - Renault, 15 000 jobs, Air France, 7 500. In Germany, all DAX companies will cut 80,000 jobs over the next two years – Mercedes 4,000, VW 27,000 – and in Italy, the number has risen by 290,000 in six months. Studies show that the Corona crisis now affects one in five jobs on this continent. We do not currently have any answers to these tasks. People are afraid of their standard of living, of their future, of their social standard, and we currently have no answers. I would also like to point out that I do not believe that this is just a dent, a short-term development that we have. If you look at the figures from China, for example, you have to see, unfortunately, that China has only had a few months this year where there has been economic decline; China is already growing again. Next year, more than 8% plus in china's economic figures are forecast. Economic power in this world is currently being redistributed. This can be compared to a post-war situation where the weights shift massively. China is currently the winner, and Europe is currently the loser. That is the reality when we look at the world map. That is why we must now put jobs and jobs at the heart of the political debate. As the Recovery Fund, Vice-President Sefsovic mentioned, a prioritisation for the agenda for the future must be created. With regard to the internal market, we need a renewed basis for prosperity. We need an end to isolation and selfishness. We need to look again at common rules at European level. We finally need proposals from the Commission and not just statements from the Commission. Thirdly, we must tackle bureaucracy. 60, 70 years of ever new regulation on top leads to paralysis and not to the freedom of our businesses. We must finally face up to this question. Fourthly, we must take care of exports. Our prosperity is based on the fact that we export to neighbouring countries, and I am already concerned about this when I consider, for example, the discussion about Mercosur. Europe must have the strength to conclude trade agreements in the future, otherwise we will not be able to secure our prosperity in the long term. Innovation: Financing innovation is important. A reform agenda at national level, and Vice-President Efsovic, has mentioned it: we must put an end to hard Brexit, this madness. We must reach a reasonable compromise with our British friends. We in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats want the continent's main issue to finally be discussed in the coming weeks, and that is the economic question of whether we will be able to secure prosperity. It is the basis of our social model, and that is why we need jobs, jobs and jobs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2020-10-06.json", "name": "Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, events in the European Union neighborhood do not stop, and last summer he has demonstrated this with a series of crises in Lebanon, Belarus, Mali and the eastern Mediterranean. The unity reached at the European Council to sanction those responsible for violent repression in Belarus is good news. So is the message of firmness to Turkey to respect international law. There is scope to reduce tensions in the Mediterranean and holding a multilateral conference is the ideal space for this. The pandemic has highlighted both our strengths and weaknesses. Faced with the strategic rivalry between the United States and China, the European Union cannot be a mere arbiter. He has to become a global actor with his own voice. That is why we support strategic autonomy that allows us to rebuild our industrial and digital independence in the face of future crises. But let us be frank, the strategic autonomy of the European Union will only be a reality if we are able to guarantee social cohesion, a single market that meets the objectives of the European Green Pact and a competitive digital transition that leaves no one behind. The first wave of the pandemic attacked everyone equally, but on the second wave not everyone can defend themselves in the same way. Cuts in health, science and education resulting from the 2008 crisis have left a wide swath of the population unsused. Faced with the layers of population that can cope with the pandemic with telework and educational and technological support for their children, the most disadvantaged classes coexist in small flats, in high-density neighborhoods, with face-to-face work, without resources to complement their children's education and with health centers that are overwhelmed. This time we cannot afford a two-speed recovery of the European economy, and to avoid this we need the European Union budget for the next seven years and the recovery plan to be available as soon as possible. We are prepared to reach an agreement through fair and sincere negotiation. But the Council must park its game of accusations. We have been waiting two years for ministers to negotiate, so we cannot now give in as Parliament to sacrifice the priorities already agreed in this House. If we want to end the technology gap, we need a recovery plan that invests 20% in the digital transition. If we are to guarantee the human capital of the European Union, programmes such as Erasmus or as Horizon Europe must be respected in the next budget. And if we aspire to definitively defeat the pandemic, development cooperation and humanitarian aid must be sufficiently funded, because we will only defeat the virus within and outside our borders. We are in time to avoid a social fracture if we can make sure that the sacrifice of recovery does not go to the most vulnerable. Let us do so with a clear and ambitious timetable on new own resources. Because the adoption of new taxes, such as financial transitions or greenhouse gas emissions, will allow us to guarantee the public accounts of the Member States and the purchasing power of taxpayers.

Mr President, Mr President, dear Charles, thank you again for being here. Speaking of international relations, this debate that took place in the Council was more than necessary. Some powers have decided to complicate the situation, as if the health crisis, the economic crisis and the climate crisis were not enough. At a time when the world has to stick together, some have decided to play it. We must therefore ensure that the Union becomes a geopolitical, economic and democratic power. There is an urgent need for a common strategic vision to become a truly geopolitical Europe, to act rather than react, and this with speed when necessary. But this implies that the Member States understand the value of a truly collective action. This is not always the case in international relations, because everyone defends their interests.  And in the face of China, Turkey or Russia, we now need a strategic vision, but also unity and firmness in action. How could we define ourselves as a real geopolitical actor if we need two months to sanction the Lukashenko regime and, two months later, it has still not been placed on this list.  We simply lose credibility when we meet the Council just to discuss. Our power must be based on new tools of action and decision-making. Passing foreign policy by qualified majority and putting in place a regime of human rights sanctions are among the emergencies now. This would allow us to react quickly, for example in situations such as the poisoning of Alexei Navalny.  The Council also spoke of Europe's economic power. Our influence depends on our economic influence and this economic influence depends on our climate ambition and our mastery of digital technology. Parliament has recently set up a special committee on artificial intelligence in the digital age, we intend to make proposals in this area. Our internal market, our social and democratic organisation and the strategic autonomy of our economy require a real ambition to invest in digital. Democratic power, at last. We can only be credible at the international level if we are blameless ourselves. All strategic development must be based on strong values: freedom, democracy and the rule of law. What credibility would we have, beyond our borders, if every European could not count on an independent judiciary, free from political pressure and clientelism. If every European could not count on an independent press, and on journalists free from any influence exerted by oligarchs close to power. If public funds, instead of fuelling innovation and healthy investment, sometimes end up in the pockets of the corrupt and obscure networks of interests. We must therefore be clear:without democratic values, the injection of financial liquidity will not be sufficient. We need both. If we lack a common foundation of values, we will not be able to solve concrete problems, such as health coordination to deal with coronavirus. And this coordination, Parliament has been asking for and demanding for months, and we can see that there are still Member States that do not respond to it. If it is still not in place, it is because some want to feed a health nationalism, a clash of values on our continent, more than a shock of solidarity. We must not accept it, because we will all pay the price. The Union must therefore be this force capable of protecting the health, employment and rights of all European citizens.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 3, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2020-10-06.json", "name": "Marco ZANNI", "mepid": "124780", "text": "  Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr Michel, I increasingly have the impression that whenever important European institutions, especially at a time of crisis, come together to decide something, they only show how torn this continent is and how much this continent is now adrift, a secondary continent, a victim of the wrong political choices made, especially over the last twenty years. You began your speech by talking about foreign policy, talking about what you decided about the various geopolitical hotbeds around Europe – and my fellow Members have mentioned this: foreign dictators make a mockery of us when you see these decisions. You have sanctioned Belarus, but you have forgotten to sanction the leader of that country, who is responsible for what is happening. As usual, you praised the attitude towards Turkey, which nevertheless remains a lascivious attitude, an attitude that allows Erdoğan, the Turkish dictator, to make a mockery of the European institutions, to make a mockery of the European Member States and to continue to challenge and provoke the European Union and the Member States by doing what it wants, without us being able to take decisive action. It is once again a totally inconsistent approach, where we are lascivious to foreign dictators while we allow ourselves to debate the rule of law, the behaviour of certain Member States, forgetting, once again, that it is not the European Union that legitimises the Member States, but the States that legitimise the Union: this is a concept that we should all have more respect for. The second point, with which I am going to close, is the most important point in my opinion: there was talk of recovery fund, in July a great deal was touted but in the end what remains on the table? There remains an agreement that has not yet been drawn up; we do not know when and how the money will come and the impact, seeing the numbers published by the Commission, is absolutely minimal. Next year, in 2021, 6 % of the amount will be paid if there is an agreement. In the face of a double-digit fall in GDP for my country, we will receive support of 0.16 % of GDP. But we're sure there will be taxes, what you call own resources. A plastic tax will arrive on 1 January. You will say: \"very well\", it helps because it allows us to attract resources and also allows us to reduce the use of un recycled plastic. But again, two one. Either we will have a source of funding, through a European tax, or we will have a reduction in plastics: it is not possible to achieve both objectives at the same time. I will close with a comment, which I would like to see at the next European Council. We are in the greatest moment of crisis in the European Union and the Member States, an exogenous crisis that does not depend on us. We have made a Stability and Growth Pact, precisely because in times of difficulty we must have stability and growth and what happens? At a time when we are facing the greatest crisis, when we need stability and growth, we must suspend this pact!

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, what strikes me in the conclusions of the European Council is the asymmetry in the handling of Belarusian, Chinese, Russian and Turkish cases. The authorities of these four states daily and brutally flout the very principles of democracy and, at the international level, systematically oppose the strength of the fait accompli with the law. But now only Lukashenko's regime is being subjected to sanctions that ensure, understand who can, to spare the autocrat when two days ago, his riot police arrested eleven reporters and even a 13-year-old girl. Big threat. Faced with China, the heads of state and government still refuse to even name the Uighur minority, of which one million citizens are prisoners of re-education camps. Faced with Russia, we will simply ask for an investigation into the poisoning of Vladimir Putin's opponent, Alexei Navalny. As for Turkey, it is once again invited to dialogue as Erdogan continues to vindicate, the political opposition, journalists, academics, human rights activists and multiplies military adventures abroad. Like you, Mr Michel, I believe in the virtues of dialogue, but I also believe that we must be able to resist if we want to be respected. However, the European Union's willingness to resist is inversely proportional to its dependence on its neighbours: commercial dependence on China, energy dependence on Russia, dependence on asylum and migration on Turkey.  We must therefore find the means of greater autonomy. The relocation of our economy, as well as the energy transition, go in this direction. Similarly, a Union capable of taking its fair share in the reception of refugees and migrants would be less vulnerable to the blackmail of the potentates to whom we have very recklessly entrusted the keys to our borders. And it is not the Commission's recent proposals, Mr Vice-President, that will bring Europe out of this unworthy myth of the fortress.  More than all this, ladies and gentlemen, what devalues the word of the European Union is its inability to uphold even the rule of law which it would like to be the herald of outside. And make no mistake, violations of freedoms are not the preserve of the two usual suspects.  The repression of the right to protest in France, the Chovanec case in Belgium, the discriminatory treatment of Catalan prisoners in Spain or the way we treat refugees at our borders, remind us that no Member State should enjoy a presumption of exemplarity and that our vigilance must be permanent. This is the meaning of the European Parliament's resolute commitment to the current negotiations on the Union's budget and its recovery plan.  Finally, we want the European Union to have an effective instrument that will enable us to uphold a simple principle: the benefits of membership of the Union require respect for the foundations of democracy and our values, starting with respect for human dignity, that of all human beings present and to come, here and elsewhere.  A more balanced interdependence, an ability to take responsibility and a stronger coherence with the values it proclaims, Mr President, are the conditions for a more geopolitical European Union.  But to do that, we still have to give us the means to do so. The means of effective joint action in external affairs, such as budgetary or fiscal matters, the unanimity rule puts the Union at the mercy of the most extreme points of view.

Mr President, I will try to stay within the speaking time, as usual. One of the last points in the Council's conclusions is Armenia. That is, of course, a pity, because we see that it is actually the weakest part of these conclusions at the same time.  In 2012, the European Union was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, and I sometimes wonder why. If I look at the United States, I have the impression that Mr Trump has achieved more successes in four years than the European Union has achieved in 20 years. If I can take the list – and now, of course, you should not get angry –: Kosovo, Serbia, at the front door, economic normalisation thanks to the United States; Israel, diplomatic relations with the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain; in Afghanistan peace negotiations after 20 years of war; North Korea, the fat man kept in check through negotiations; united states, canada and mexico.  Yes, that's not nothing. And, Mr Michel, you are no further than calling. I would say a bit more energy, a bit more Trumpism, maybe.  Because now, after ten years of European common foreign policy, we are only seeing weak porridge, when there are means of pressure to put pressure on Azerbaijan and Turkey, but they are afraid to use it. So I propose a coalition of the willing states, both in Europe and hopefully with the United States, to put pressure on these countries. For, Mr President, it is macabre that 100 years after the genocide in Armenia we do not go beyond moral appeals. We have to do something. And if the EU cannot do that, then European states must do so themselves in cooperation with the United States, because at least it can show power.

Mr President, Mr Michel, for the past two years Turkey has been continuing its illegal activity in the Cypriot EEZ. For the past two years, unfortunately, we have witnessed a bad theatre. To tell you the truth, of course, I did not expect the European Council to impose sanctions on Turkey, and I am sure that it will not impose sanctions on Turkey either in December, for reasons we all know very well. Of course sanctions are not an end in itself, Mr Michel, but Turkey will be given a positive political agenda. However, Turkey must change course, stop violating the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus, enter the negotiations in a positive mood for a solution to the Cyprus problem on the basis of the bi-social federation, stop threatening and ordering the illegal settlement of Famagusta.

Famagusta is a European affair. History must not repeat itself, the European Union must act immediately to prevent this possibility, because if Famagusta is colonized, this will be a tombstone for the solution of the Cyprus problem.

Mr President, thank you for giving me the opportunity to reply after this first round of speech, it is proof of the interactivity between the democratic European institutions.  Mr. Weber, you said, ''It is a good compromise, but there is no leadership.'' And that is the real issue for the future of the European Union, and that is why I started my message by declaring that our aim should be 'less dependency and more influence'. And for the first time in the Council, I have chosen to bring the debate on strategic autonomy to open economies by supporting the multilateral model.  The debate is not over, but it is a starting point on which to start the debate, because Europe is an economic power: the first trading power, the second largest economy in the world. It is also a democratic power: we guarantee a world order based on values, on the rule of law, on the rule of law, values that inspire every action we take. And the question is how the Europe of tomorrow can be more of a political power, with a positive effect inspired by our values, considering that the pillar of climate change coupled with the pillar of digital change are spaces within which we will exercise our strategic influence, as we have once done, for example , in the chemical field, or in the processing of private data, for example, that is the issue. And you will observe that since this new institutional cycle, only a few months ago, a few clear choices have been made. China, for example. I remember that for a long time Europe was totally divided. How to approach the relationship with China? In a few months, through political work, through dialogue between us, we have aligned a clear, strategic position and we are expressing the message clearly. When I speak to President Xi about fundamental values, human rights, I am not looking down, I am talking about Uighurs. We do not have the same political model or the same economic model. There are three points: we want to be engaged with China, we believe in the virtues of dialogue, we think that China is a partner to manage the issue like COVID and the climate issue. You will also observe that China, like South Africa, is committed to the issue of climate neutrality. It is certainly not enough, we must remain vigilant, but it is an approach that shows that we have an influence, it goes in the right direction. And finally, I would also like to highlight another point that I like to highlight so as not to be like I have not heard. The question of sanctions: Belarus, Turkey, differences of opinion expressed on the issue of sanctions. From my point of view, as with the European Council, sanctions are not a goal in themselves. Sanctions are an instrument. They are an element, along with many others at the international level, that could perhaps be more coherent, not just for a geopolitical Commission, but for a geopolitical European Union. In my view, that is the sense of the process that must be pursued. Once the sanctions are activated, we can actually decide to lighten them, to remove them, to extend them, to make them worse, and it is in this spirit that, in full consciousness, a choice has been made. We are advocating for an inclusive dialogue, dear Mr Weber, within the framework of Belarus, we are advocating for CSOs to play a role and we will come back regularly to the issue of Belarus to see how we should act and perhaps make decisions based on the positive or negative developments that will take place. Turkey now. Clear and clear solidarity with Greece and Cyprus. We defend sovereignty. We defend sovereign rights. A first impact, albeit slight, certainly timid, intervened since even before the European Council, the prospect of a resumption of dialogue, after weeks of tension throughout the summer, between Greece and Turkey, opened up. It's not enough, it's fragile, it's not naivety, but it's a first effect, it's a first impact, it seems to me.  In Cyprus a few hours ago, the ship Yavuz left the waters. This is not enough, we will remain attentive, vigilant, and I will be in contact on behalf of the European Union with President Erdogan to see how I can, on behalf of the Union, act on the ground, both with firmness (in terms of principles and international law) but also in opening up to engage in more positive discussions if there is a common will. I also fully support the process of United Nations, I hope that after the elections in the northern part of the island, which are due to take place in October, there will be the capacity for the United Nations to relaunch this dialogue and that is why I have indicated that in this dialogue several central and difficult issues will have to be discussed through dialogue and I hope progress can be made, such as the issue of the sharing of hydrocarbon revenues which is a subject with others. be debated. And finally, Europe is at the rendezvous when, for example, we take the initiative of this multilateral conference on this part of the Mediterranean to put around the table, to engage together those who sometimes have common points of view but also sometimes different points of view on maritime disputes, on energy issues, on security issues, on security issues. , on economic development issues. This, ladies and gentlemen, is how I see the role of the European Union and therefore I react, Mr Weber, a good compromise, no leadership, I roll up my sleeves for a European leadership less dependence, more influence.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 14, "date": "2020-10-06.json", "name": "Daniel CASPARY", "mepid": "28219", "text": "   Mr President, Mr President Michel, I would like to thank mr Michel for his work on What you have just formulated is very exciting.

Thousands of Islamist mercenaries guilty of war crimes by Daesh, sent by Erdogan to commit others and continue the Armenian genocide perpetrated 80 years ago by the Ottoman Empire. Between 1.2 and 1.5 million victims, a genocide that the Turkish authorities have never acknowledged, whose recognition by other states has been described by Erdogan as the greatest insult possible. But history is not an insult! A history that Erdogan would like to rewrite, however, since all his manoeuvres converge towards a single goal: to reconstitute the Ottoman Empire, to regain the role of leader of the Sunni Islamic world, which Turkey had at the time of the caliphate. A project he assumes, including in his official propaganda videos: military actions in Syria and Libya, the barely concealed proximity with the Islamic State, the orchestration of a real migratory invasion in Greece, the destruction of churches in Anatolia, piracy of Cypriot resources in the Mediterranean, the transformation of St. Sophia Basilica into a mosque and now the incursion into Armenian territory , the oldest Christian country in the world. All of Erdogan's actions sign up for this neo-Ottoman inspiration and during this time the Council has a strong taste for litote. In its conclusions of 2 October, it strongly condemns the violations of the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus, which must cease. But it has been 50 years, 50 years since Turkey occupied half the territory of a Member State, and you continue to want, I quote, a dialogue in good faith. Retaliation could have been taken on the money from the accession process, on EIB funding, on securing the borders of Greece and Bulgaria, on the suspension of the customs union, which allows Turkey to make 40% of its foreign trade with the European Union. But nothing. Nothing! Europe is afraid of Turkey and the response is tragic, the Council has once again given in to this constant racket, he reminds us Balzac, saying that resignation is a daily suicide.

The inclusion of regions in fund management would allow us to streamline and carry out more projects, thus gaining more credibility from the European Union.

The European Commission has already proposed to the press a so-called migration pact from the European Union on 23 September. But the European Council, which represents the Member States, has accepted that Charles Michel and the German Presidency have kept this away from the agenda of the European summit on both 2 October and 15 October. The migration pact is nowhere to be seen. Moreover, in the European Parliament, too, the majority has rejected the migration pact from the plenary agenda. The fact that you all want to keep this pact out of your eye is absolutely not normal and is absolutely unacceptable. After all, migration is the top theme of choice for the citizens of the Member States you have to represent. Ladies and gentlemen, last Saturday, at a meeting of the Belgian Parliament, the new Belgian Government was installed in this Chamber, after the previous one had fallen at the end of October 2018 – almost two years ago – on the United Nations migration pact, which, by the way, was signed by Charles Michel on behalf of Belgium against the wishes of his own government. That was why the government fell. What the population thinks about this migration pact is now known. The Flemish Interest, my party, which opposed it, came back here in the European Parliament with three times as many seats as before.  Your migration pact is along the same globalist line: verbally embracing the so-called return of foreigners, but in practice juggling the concept of 'solidarity' until the flow of migrants to our Member States becomes a real distribution of migrants with a compulsion on the Member States to take in your migrants – if necessary against their will – on the basis of an asylum concept that is completely outdated and abused.  I therefore call on the Council to put the opposition to this Migration Pact of the European Union immediately on the agenda. Enough is enough.

I will try to cover as much as I can within the time limit. First, I would like to underline the fact that President Michel covered quite extensively the issues linked with foreign policy, but I feel that it was very much present in a lot of interventions, so let me add a couple of points on behalf of the Commission. First and foremost, I would like to underline the unity which was achieved in this European Council: the unity which, as many of you said, took us quite some time. Therefore, I would also refer all of you to the clear statement of our President that, clearly, if comes to human rights and to sanction regimes, we would prefer in the Commission to use the passerelle clause and to move to the qualified majority vote, because I believe that in this case we would be much more action-based, more operational, and it would allow us to be much faster in adopting sometimes very difficult decisions. I would also like to do one more thing. I would like to send a very clear and positive message to the people of Greece and Cyprus: we have your back. You have our unconditional solidarity and strong support, and we stand united in defence of your sovereignty and of your legitimate sovereign rights. I think that it’s also important to underscore the fact that the EU leaders have made it very clear, in the case of renewed unilateral actions by Turkey, that we are ready to use our restrictive measures. That message was also very clear. But we want to reach a solution through dialogue. Many of you – I think the last was Mr Biedroń – made reference to Belarus. I think here our unity was simply a moral obligation, and therefore I am so glad that today the European Union is united at the side of the people of Belarus and that we would fight and push for the right of all Belarus citizens to elect their President through new elections, which would be free and fair. This is the European Union’s position. Therefore, I would underline once again the gradual approach in the case of sanctions against the concrete persons of Belarus. The leaders of the European Parliament – Mr Weber, Mr Cioloş, Ms García Pérez – have made very important reference to the fact that the EU must remain a global player, that we have to make sure that the European Union is a geopolitical union as well, and that we have to reduce the dependencies on third countries – as was underlined by Mr Lamberts – and that what is very important is the jobs, jobs, jobs in this crisis. I want to tell you that we in the Commission hear you loud and clear, and all our actions are aimed at making sure that the European Union remains a global economic superpower, a green and digital transformation leader and a social model for the rest of the world, and that we are the first major economy to put competitive sustainability at the core of our policies. We are working very hard to achieve what Madame Loiseau described so well as the strategic autonomy of our economy. To achieve that, we are strengthening the pillar of social rights. Very soon we will come to present to you our proposals on the minimum wage and on pay transparency. We are going to use the Just Transition Mechanism in a very efficient way to make sure that nobody is left behind in this very demanding twin green and digital transition. We will introduce the concrete steps in applying the new industrial strategy, where we will use fully the convening power of the Commission and the economic strength of the European single market. I am sure you have noticed, because many of you are working on very concrete projects linked with the forging of our new European alliances to make sure that the EU will be the leader in all key technologies of the 21st century. With Mr Ertug we are working together on the European Battery Alliance and, within two and a half years, we have completely reversed the table where Europe is now the number one direction of foreign investment when it comes to batteries. We are investing three times more in Europe in the battery sectors than in China, and we want to achieve the same result when it comes to hydrogen, quantum computing and critical raw materials. We are also very conscious that, to achieve all that, we need to cut red tape and reduce the administrative burden. We will come very soon to you with very concrete proposals in that direction. Ms Geese referred to the importance of a state aid review and Mr Jurzyca underlined the importance of the single market. We are working very hard to remove as many obstacles as possible on the single market to re-energise and revive it, and we are currently undergoing the most in-depth review of the state aid rules in the history of the Commission. Very soon, in the middle of October, we will start to receive the first recovery plans from our Member States, and we clearly want these plans to be focused on people, on their jobs and on the twin transition. We want 20% of the financial support to be used for digital means, 37% for green goal deals, and we want to use this unique chance for every single Member State to leap forward, to build new economies, not to restore the old ones. And I believe that, with the help of all of you, we will achieve that. I would like to reassure Ms Marques and Mr Mureşan that the Commission will do all in its power to be the best facilitator to achieve the speedy agreement on the next multiannual financial perspective and the Next Generation EU Mechanism. Last, a word to Mr Silva Pereira on Brexit. I really would like to thank this House for the strong support which we feel in every step of the negotiations and in every round of talks.

We already have a biodiversity strategy from the Commission. Now, here today we are talking about the EU forest strategy. Having said that, I would now like to explain to this Chamber how a balanced forest strategy should and could be built for us.  Forests and the forest-based sector have a crucial role to play in achieving the Union’s climate, environmental and biodiversity goals, namely within the Green Deal. The enhancement of biodiversity, the fight against climate change and the transitions to a circular bioeconomy and to a fossil-free society will never be possible without multifunctional, healthy, and sustainably managed forests. The Commission will publish its new forest strategy during the first quarter of 2021. The previous strategy was published in 2013, so a new one is now needed for the post-2020 period.  We need an ambitious and self-standing EU forest strategy. It should highlight a balanced approach between the economic, ecological and social sustainability of forests to ensure the continuity of the multifunctional role of forests in the European Union. The new EU forest strategy should act as an effective coordination tool between the various EU forest-related policies, taking into account the whole forest-based value chain. Forests and the forest-based value chain offer crucial climate benefits, such as the promotion of carbon sequestration, the storage of carbon in wood-based products, and the substitution of fossil-based raw materials and energy. In addition, it is crucial to ensure appropriate measures to prevent natural disasters such as bark beetle epidemics, droughts and forest fires.  The own initiative report to be voted on today and tomorrow is a balanced one, and the positions of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) and the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE) were taken into account in the negotiations. The report addresses the importance of enhancing forest biodiversity; just to mention, the word ‘biodiversity’ is mentioned 39 times in this report. The report points out that healthy and resilient forests are a precondition for the general well-being of our forests, as well as for their economic and social sustainability. It also addresses afforestation and reforestation as suitable tools in enhancing forest cover.  The report calls for the protection of primary forests. Yes indeed, it does, contrary to some of the claims that the members of this Chamber have received. And it calls on the Commission to introduce a definition for old-growth forests. It also emphasises the important role of sustainable forest management and bioeconomy at a time when forests are playing a key role in offering sustainable solutions to the challenges of our time. Lastly, the report notes that the jobs within the sector are dependent on resilient and well-managed forest ecosystems in the long term.

Forests occupy about 45% of the European Union’s territory. Forestry is a place of work: the wood-based industry employs 2.5 million people; about 500 000 European foresters work directly in the forest. The forest is a place for rest, recreation and contact with nature for almost 500 million European citizens, because everybody has some contact with forests.  The gross value added from forestry directly is EUR 26.5 billion, and about EUR 142 billion from the wood-based sector. This is a very important sector. Of course, the forest plays a very important role in the protection of biodiversity, climate protection, water management, air protection, etc.  I hope this own initiative report will be adopted by the European Parliament, because it will be very helpful and inspiring for the forest strategy being prepared by the Commission. This strategy will be published in the first quarter of 2021. The main direction of this strategy is defined in the Green Deal Communication, which mentioned that, building on the 23rd biodiversity strategy, the Commission would prepare a new forest strategy covering the whole forest cycle and promoting the many services that forests provide. The biodiversity strategy also mentioned that the EU must increase the quantity, quality and resilience of its forest, notably against fires, droughts, pests and diseases, and other threats likely to increase with climate change.  There is a strong link between forestry and agriculture and the farm to fork strategy. Agroforestry was listed as a potential eco-scheme – a very important part of the first pillar of the common agricultural policy – and the Commission will propose agroforestry as a potential eco-scheme in the recommendation to the Member States for their national strategic plans.  As President von der Leyen stated in her recent State of the Union speech, our current levels of consumption of raw materials, energy, water, food and land use are not sustainable. We need to change how we treat nature, how we produce and consume. Securing the health and resilience of existing and new forests, including under novel climatic conditions in the future, is crucial for their effective support to all the environmental, social and economic functions and services that forests provide to our society. This is why forests are an integral part of the European Green Deal and its EU biodiversity strategy 2030, which reiterates that forests are hugely important for biodiversity, climate and water regulation, the provision of food, medicines and materials, carbon sequestration and storage, soil stabilisation and the purification of air and water. They are also a natural home for recreation and learning about nature, while culture and heritage are preserved. With lively rural areas and wealthy rural populations, they offer opportunities for people and the planet.  Against the wider context that I outlined above, the EU forest strategy will reflect the importance of forests for achieving the different objectives and priorities of the European Green Deal. It will require a holistic approach carried out for, on the one hand, sustainable forest management that improves both their quantity and quality and, on the other hand, the multifunctional role of forests for the economic sector and communities that depend on them.  Key objectives of the new EU forest strategy will be effective re- and afforestation, as well as forest preservation and restoration in Europe. Furthermore, the aim is to help increase absorption of CO2, reduce the incidence and extent of forest fires and other climate-related pressures, and promote the circular bioeconomy in full respect of ecological principles favourable to biodiversity.  The strategy will need the right balance and synergies between the different socioeconomic interests related to forests and the need to increase our forest protection and restoration efforts to achieve our climate and biodiversity goals.  The forest strategy will need to have a strong protection and restoration dimension in strong cooperation with foresters and local communities. In line with the biodiversity strategy, the last remaining primary and old growth forests in the EU need to be protected. An inclusive process has already started, involving Member States and all stakeholders, to achieve that. In addition, some parts of the new protected areas under the regular protection regime will probably also need to include forests.  The upcoming forest strategy will also include a roadmap for planting at least three billion additional trees – maybe more – in the EU by 2030, in full respect of ecological principles. This was a key commitment in the biodiversity strategy to deliver on Green Deal objectives and thus contribute to both climate mitigation and adaptation and revert biodiversity loss. In parallel, the EU forest strategy will have to have a strong economic dimension. It has to lay the foundations for innovation and the promotion of new products, and to replace the intensive fossil-based materials and effectively contribute to a new low carbon society. As an example, President von der Leyen referred in her State of the Union speech to turning the construction sector from a carbon source to a carbon sink by applying organic building materials like wood. Moreover, under the CAP, the EU will also increasingly have to help to ensure that forestry in the EU, together with agriculture, is socially, economically and environmentally sustainable, supporting and strengthening the benefits that forestry brings to European society and providing sustainable economic rewards for farmers, forest managers and the EU as a whole. Overall, let me conclude, the new EU forest strategy will aim to build sustainable forest management and, aligned with relevant EU international commitments, the strategy’s principles and objectives should also help inform EU policy relevant to forests and the forest sector.  It is essential to ensure consistency on EU forest-related policies and the action on internal forests. We will take the European Parliament’s resolution fully into account when developing the upcoming forest strategy, as well as the recently adopted resolution on the Commission’s communication on stepping up action to protect the world’s forests, which we welcome.  The Commission looks forward to working closely together with the European Parliament on the future strategy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 67, "date": "2020-10-06.json", "name": "Fredrick FEDERLEY", "mepid": "124989", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy.

The latter applies in particular to forests in the mountains and in the alpine region, and the European Union's forestry strategy should also take particular care of these forests. There, the already difficult economic situation of the forest and wood is even more complicated: the harvest is expensive and the transport routes often long. Nevertheless, these forests should and must also be managed. Only if they are rejuvenated regularly can they fulfil this protective function. In addition, these forests often produce high-quality wood, and these forests are also important energy suppliers. Innovative cycles, local cycles, have often been created, which contribute to the replacement of imported oil, gas, concrete, plastic or steel with domestic wood. In these Alpine regions, we also have functioning forest services that ensure sustainability. Nor do we need to present ourselves here in Brussels as great teachers and create new rules.

Our forests can play a significant role in the fight against the climate crisis, as we know, but they are also currently victims of climate change. The EU must therefore take more responsibility for the reconstruction of our forests today as a matter of urgency. We urgently need forest conversion, towards more resilient and species-rich stocks, which can better store water. The forestry of the future must be thought through and through with the European Green Deal and the Biodiversity Strategy, because woods from species-rich forests that form deep, humus-rich soils have the best carbon footprint imaginable in the long term. On the other hand, dry forests and plantations, which are constantly falling victim to drought, storms and bark beetles, have a miserable carbon footprint in the long run. And that's where species protection and forestry come together. In some places, this will require a major change in forestry practice. However, no sector is as allergic to the word \"change\" as the forestry sector – and rightly so: as trees and forests grow slowly, we must work together with foresters to think through the changes. That is why the EU must also offer the sector and forest owners a perspective – massive support for this change that we are facing. Change must be thought of together with an EU-wide timber construction and bioeconomy strategy, because the new timbers, which are supposed to grow in mixed stocks, must also find buyers. Wood is an excellent CO2 storage system – we have heard it – which is why we should also use this valuable raw material in durable products, through wood construction or high-quality furniture. The industrial process and burning of specially designed forests, on the other hand, is a climate catastrophe. The bottom line is that the own-initiative report that is being voted on today does not go far enough in its responsibility for the forests of the future.

It is necessary to work for sustainable and multifunctional forests and mountains, which are a source of natural and economic wealth. In Galicia we are committed to a management of forest resources based on bioeconomy.  In this regard, I was pleased to see how this report by Mr Sarvamaa is going in this direction and is also committed to strengthening sustainable forest management. In addition, forests are also a way to drive the economic revival needed after the COVID-19 pandemic; for example, the Xunta de Galicia is evaluating the creation of a manufacturing center for textile fibres, from wood, within the framework of the circular economy.  Another very important issue is the prevention of forest fires, a terrible threat that Spain and other southern countries face every summer and which is aggravated by climate change.

However, this can be done most effectively within the framework of sustainable forest management, and it is therefore regrettable that the publication of the biodiversity strategy preceded the forestry strategy. This was a mistake on the part of the European Commission, in my opinion. This should have happened in parallel and in a coordinated manner.  All the more so because the objectives of the biodiversity strategy have an economically and socially significant impact on agriculture and forestry. However, in the absence of a preliminary assessment, it is clear that these will not have the expected impact and that comprehensive impact assessments should therefore be carried out.

They are very important, very valuable, and I can declare that both Commissioner Sinkevičius and I , because together we are working on the concept of this strategy, will incorporate the comments that you are presenting, as far as possible. Of course, we will take into account the content of the report that will be adopted. Of course, I will not comment on all the statements of which there were almost 50. I am pleased with the strong involvement of your Members, of interest in this strategy. A few issues may need to be clarified. The first is that the strategy is not yet there. There were voices here, indicating that we were discussing an existing strategy. We have a strategy so far, the new one will of course be a continuation of it, but an improved continuation – these are our ambitions to prepare a better strategy than it was until now. Legal basis. Of course, we remember that forest management is a national competence. The strategy will not be a binding piece of legislation forcing Member States to do anything. We hope that there will be an agreed political declaration of the will of the Member States to ensure, on an equal footing, that European forests are kept in good condition on an equal footing. Many of your statements highlighted the issues of multifunctionality. This is, moreover, crucial in mr Sarvamy's draft report. I am very pleased with this approach, and that will be the Commission's approach. Of course, environmental function is more important for some, others stress economic issues as very important. We need to balance that. We want European forests to be a mainstay of nature, to be green lungs, as has been emphasised in some statements, but to be open, to be accessible to our society, not just to be admired from afar, but to be able to use them. And, of course, the economic role. This cannot be abandoned and must be carried out in a sustainable way. 60% of European forests are privately owned, so we must also respect the rights of the owners, who, as indicated in one statement, are of course proud if their forests are well managed. There must be no contradiction between the strategies that the European Commission has already adopted. The forestry strategy must be in line with both the general Green Deal Communication and biodiversity strategies, to some extent the field-to-table strategy.  For me personally, it is particularly important to make good use of the elements of the common agricultural policy, because such instruments are – afforestation measures in the second pillar. I have mentioned and will repeat: agro-forestry as one of the potential eco-programmes to which we will encourage Member States, farmers, to use it. This will also be one way of increasing the forestry of the European Union. Fortunately, the area of forests in the European Union is increasing, forestry is increasing and this trend needs to be maintained. We need good, growing forests. Of course, we will also remember the forests in the world, we have instruments in common in the European Union's trade policy. We will try to pursue such a policy, so as not only not to favour some kind of robbery of forest management outside Europe, but also to promote the protection of forests and to use, as far as possible, the trade policy of the European Union. We will base our activities on scientific research, of course. Here it is very important to cooperate with science and take all actions based on solid scientific knowledge. It is also important to avoid the trend of fighting plastic, as has been mentioned in some statements, and that forests are not victims of this change of concept. We also need to rationally shape the demand for wood so that, of course, this is not at the expense of over-exploitation of forests. Mr President, to sum up, I am very pleased with this discussion. I think we are on the right track together to develop a good forestry strategy – one that will be accepted by everyone in the European Union and consistently implemented. And thanks to it we will preserve the beauty of our forests, their natural values, but also preserve their important economic potential.

First of all, I would say to Ms Toussaint – unfortunately she is not here, but maybe you will give my regards – that I would probably enjoy condemning Mr Bolsonaro on how he treats the Brazilian forests, but this is the European forests strategy, once again, that we are debating today.  Then to Mr Bompard, I want to just make one factual correction – there were plenty of reasons to do that in many speeches, but there’s one that I would specifically like to make – and that’s when he said that this report is promoting wood as a source of energy. The way I understand the word ‘promote’ in the English language, this report is not promoting the use of wood as a source of energy.  That leads me to say the most important thing about this report and about this discussion. Forests are of enormous importance to all of us. So we must not have anything, and we must not accept anything, but a holistic and self—standing forest strategy. That is what we need. I really want to use this opportunity to thank everyone.

Europe's forests have a number of very important dimensions and must all be treated in a balanced way. The environmental dimension is very clear to everyone, as forests are a global asset that is extremely important as co2 binders. In many EU Member States, the number of forests has drastically declined and there are different reasons for this – mainly the development of industry and agriculture and population growth. In Europe, however, there are also countries where forests cover more than half of the territory and are in good condition. Estonia, together with other Nordic countries, is a good example. In order to maintain the health of forests, forests need to be managed intelligently. Forest management is the management of renewable resources, i.e. in addition to logging, the importance of forest restoration must be taken into account. In many Member States, forest reworking is a very important source of livelihood and employs many different industries. The Commission's forestry strategy needs to emphasise the importance of forest management, as the half-million workers involved in forest harvesting and the 2.6 million people more broadly involved in the area need to send a clear message about the perspective and potential of the sector. Forests also have a very strong socio-cultural dimension, the protection of which is the responsibility of every nation. Forests have important meaning for Estonia, as thousands of people fled the Soviet occupation into the forest. Resistance to the occupation regime was also organized from the forest.

The European Climate Law is indeed the cornerstone of the European Green Deal, as it enshrines into legislation the Union’s objective to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at the latest. The climate neutrality objective brings with it a transition of historic dimension, which Europe will undergo in the coming decades. We are moving away from our history as the coal and steel union and heading towards climate neutrality. The report that we will see voted on this afternoon improves the Commission’s proposal on a number of points and, colleagues, we are responsible for this; we need to listen to citizens, scientists and the movement of young people and do our very best to improve this legislation and make it responsible for our time. The report sets a binding target for the Union and the Member States to achieve climate neutrality by 2050 at the latest. Thereafter, emissions shall be negative. Everyone must contribute to reach the climate neutrality objective. This is something we need to do together. The report proposes a strengthened 2030 climate target of 60% in order to be in line with science and give Europe the best possible chance of reaching its climate neutrality objective and respecting the Paris Agreement. We need to have a higher target for 2030. The Commission has proposed a net target of at least 55% for 2030, meaning approximately between 51% and 53% in real emission reductions, depending on how much greenhouse gas our natural sinks will be able to remove from the atmosphere. This is not good enough. We need a stronger target if we are serious about respecting the Paris Agreement and our own responsibility to reach climate neutrality. This is also why the report includes a new EU climate target for 2040. This is a crucial element to ensure that Europe is on track to achieve climate neutrality by 2050.  To take responsible climate action, we also need to know exactly how much Europe can emit without undermining the Union’s commitment under the Paris Agreement. Therefore, the report also calls for the introduction of a greenhouse gas budget setting out the total remaining quantity of greenhouse gas emissions as CO2 equivalent that could be emitted up to 2050 without putting at risk the 1.5 degree temperature goal. Elements of social fairness and solidarity have been strengthened throughout the regulation. For the S&amp;D Group, this is fundamental. We will only succeed in our climate efforts if everyone is with us, if no one is left behind. It must be socially just and we must make sure that it’s for all the citizens.  I would like to underline the importance of the reference to the 2015 International Labour Organization’s guidelines for a just transition towards environmentally sustainable economies and societies. We also emphasise the importance of social partners, which I’m very proud of. There are also strong provisions on science, not to mention the set-up of an independent climate council at European level: the European Climate Change Council (ECCC), which, with the creation of climate advisory bodies at Member State level, will assess whether we are on track to achieve the climate neutrality objective and identify opportunities to further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and increase the carbon sequestration potential. Furthermore, the provisions for climate adaptation have been strengthened, with increased consideration of vulnerable groups.  I will conclude by saying this is a good proposal. I would like to thank my colleagues, all the shadows, all the people that worked with this legislation, the advisors, and also the interpretation, which has been good, the technical advisers. Thank you so much. No one is left behind.

It’s because of the College – it finished and I immediately came here. I’m really happy to discuss with you today what is I think a landmark of the European Green Deal, the climate law to turn Europe’s political climate ambitions into binding legislation.  Moving towards a climate-neutral future is the right thing to do for our children and future generations especially now, and everything we’re doing is science—based, so actually those who deny the science are being ideological, not the ones who embrace science! (Applause) If we invest hundreds of billions of euros in rescuing our economy from this pandemic we must not throw money at the old economy. We must guide our societies to a cleaner and healthier future, one that our children can embrace with hope, not fear. We must be very clear and very honest about this. This transition will affect our daily lives: from the cars we drive, from the houses we live in, from the jobs we will have in the future. I’m confident that we can make it if we do two things: if we set ourselves a sound direction and stand together as a continent in mastering the challenge. The Climate Law will set the direction by making our 2050 climate neutrality goal binding. That provides certainty at a time when so much is uncertain.  I want to stress three points. This is a Union—wide commitment to climate neutrality with a just transition for all. The target is also economy—wide: all sectors must contribute, no exceptions granted, and it’s a domestic objective delivered in Europe to inspire the world to follow our lead, and we see across the world other nations following the lead already.  For 2030 we need to increase our ambition if we want a realistic pathway to climate neutrality. Our proposal to increase the 2030 target to at least 55% emissions reductions compared to 1990 was not just conjured from thin air. We did a thorough impact assessment, as I had promised to this House. I have to say I’m really impressed by the work the Commission services have done on this.  I know that this proposal goes too far for some, and for others not far enough, but the target is ambitious. We propose to reduce our emissions over the next decade by as much as we have achieved over the past quarter century. The target is well founded in science. It shows responsibility towards developing countries, but doesn’t take on an undue burden given the ambition needed from other industrial nations. I think it’s the right target. Just as important as the goal is the realisation that we’re in this together. The transition is just – has to be just or there will just be no transition.  We must help households in regions that are at risk of being left behind. We will soon propose a renovation wave to lower energy bills and fight energy poverty. We will continue developing our Just Transition Mechanism to deliver a new future to regions where the path towards climate neutrality is particularly steep. This is our message to the miners in Asturias, the workers on Baltic peatlands and many, many others. We will stand with you to make the journey to climate neutrality with us. Let me address the role of forests and other landscapes that remove CO2 from our atmosphere. The point of climate neutrality in 2050 is that by that year we must balance CO2 emissions with removals – taking out what we put in, if you prefer a cruder expression. The sink in our forests is declining, shrinking. Rather than waiting for 2050 we want to recognise the role of natural carbon sinks now. Including the full sink in our climate target in line with our international obligations will drive us to take better care of our forests and sinks so that they can play this vital role and also give an opportunity to rural communities. This is no accounting trick or cheat code: it’s the reality of how we neutralise the negative impact of human activity on our planet and care for our natural habitat. Honourable Members, you have discussed for many months how to fix the pathway between 2030 and 2050, including an intermediate target for 2040. There is criticism of our proposal to use delegated acts to check whether we’re on track for that pathway. Let me repeat today, and you know this is my opinion: what counts is that we reach our goals. I’m open to discuss which instruments should get us there. Please help me find a solution that we can all support.  Tomorrow you will vote on turning our climate ambitions into binding law. The Commission will be an honest broker for negotiations between Parliament and Council. We will push for an ambitious seven—year budget to finance our climate ambitions, but I want to thank Parliament, and Ms Guteland in particular, already for the work on this historic piece of legislation, the Climate Law. Ambitious climate action is what we need in Europe today and in the world.

Agriculture, the environment and climate are each other's prerequisites, not each other's opposites. That is why we need concrete solutions on the table.  I propose that the European Union should support farmers in absorbing CO2 into the soil. There is huge potential if we establish a separate quota system to suck and store CO2 in the ground. This creates opportunities to finance the green transition. I have tabled an amendment on this which I hope we will be able to vote through tomorrow. We also need common standards in order to be able to measure the farmer's climate footprint by a joint assessment of a climate accounting.

If you really realise how bad it is, it's too late. That is why we must take precautions. We must act in good time, and we must indeed listen to science.

Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is safe to say that we will all remember this moment when we are older. We voted for the first European Climate Act. We have carved climate neutrality for 2050. And we were the first continent in the world to do that.  Three years ago, three countries started this battle: France, Sweden and Luxembourg. It was a very small minority and in three years they managed to convince everyone and here no one even mentioned the fact that we are going to be the first in the world to do so, it has become so obvious that the debate is now behind us. So we have to measure how far we have come and look forward to it. The second point is that obviously the 2030 target must be consistent with this climate neutrality target and here we, the environment committee within the Renew Group, believe that we can get a majority around 60%. And there are people on the European right who are more progressive than others, and if we really want to have at least 55% as the final point of negotiation with the Member States, we, as parliamentarians, must do politics, do tactics and send the most ambitious message possible with a majority. This most ambitious message possible is 60% which is why we support it and I hope that colleagues from the PPP, the right and the European centre-right will join this majority and win tomorrow in the plenary of Parliament. A final word: adaptation to climate change is fundamental, all European territories are concerned, farmers who are experiencing droughts, people living through floods, rising waters on the coasts, this European law is still too weak on adaptation, that is why we have tabled an amendment, to stop spending European money if we do not test the capacity of the big projects that we finance to adapt , to be resilient to climate change.

In future, no law may be enacted without prior examination of whether it might not be contrary to the same climate law. Even retrospectively, existing regulations will be examined and, if necessary, amended.  This law is the mother of all laws: poisonous and eerily green-dictatorial.

Our prime ministers, presidents, have agreed in the European Council that we will be talking about zero emission at European Union level. Climate law says the exact opposite. We promised that we would be sensible. A dozen or so months ago, we heard from the Environment Agency that we were not able to meet the ambitious 40% target and we are already talking about 55%, knowing what will happen to the price of allowances, because that has happened. During the pandemic, the price of a tonne of carbon dioxide almost doubled. We promised to cut red tape. And what? We have a new tool, a new institution, in addition uncounted.

Future decision-makers will no longer have the opportunity to do so, because we are running out of time. This autumn, record temperatures have been measured again in my country, Finland. This week, plants blossomed that have never bloomed at this time of year. Climate change is real and if we do not make sufficient decisions, the economic and human cost will be enormous.  We are facing a decision that will either keep us on the side of the Paris Agreement or not. The Commission's proposal does not do so. Moreover, in 2030, the Commission changed the emission reduction target to a net target, which means that the actual emission reduction is far below the 55% proposed by the Commission. According to various estimates, it is up to 3-10% lower. This solution shows a real level of ambition on the part of the Commission, which is too low. The Commission's proposal is well below the scientific recommendation, no matter how much the Commission tries to speak black and white. Industry and industry have asked for certainty about the regulatory environment in the coming years, so that they can develop their own activities accordingly and that investment be directed correctly. This is extremely important for the preservation of jobs and for the creation of new ones.  The Commission's proposal creates uncertainty. Too low ambition today means that we will have to correct the target forcefully upwards in the years to come. This is much more difficult and costly for everyone than setting a level with sufficient ambition already. Because whether we like it or not, climate change is moving forward regardless of what we think.  In committee, a clear majority supported a 60% reduction in emissions for 2030. Now that the Commission has further weakened its proposal, it is of the utmost importance that this plenary should raise the ambition of the motion. In order to have a chance of surviving climate change, we cannot go below that 60% and keep our word to the millions of Europeans for whom we promised ambitious and adequate emission reduction targets in the elections.

All the measures we take must be taken with all the protagonists, with dialogue, seeking social acceptance and with help.  We've been talking about reinforcing industrial policy for a long time. Today there are two thousand workers on strike in Spain for the closure of the intensive aluminum production plant in Galicia. One of the reasons for the closure has to do with energy costs. European industry cannot continue to bleed to death, especially exposed by unfair competition from third countries.

How we vote on the climate law today will define us. The climate crisis we are facing will not go away on its own, nor will it be solved by individual action alone. So we must reduce carbon pollution and transform our economy to run on clean renewable energy. This is not about elitists, as we heard today. This is about realists who are seeing with their eyes the impact of climate change all around us. That’s why this political group is being progressive and realistic in pushing forward a 60% CO2 reduction by 2030.  S&amp;D are pushing also for a new climate target for 2040 because we want to provide direction for our Member States, our industries and our citizens. From the very beginning we were at the forefront in asking for a climate law that can put us strongly on the path to ditch fossil fuels and switch to clean energy whilst sustaining a resilient, robust economy.  We need these laws to make sure that we are on track with our targets for 2030, for 2040 and for ensuring carbon neutrality in 2050. Just having vague goals on paper did not work, and they will definitely not work. We know some lawmakers will refuse to act. They would rather risk climate catastrophe and let the rest of us deal with the fallout. But this is not acceptable for us.

To avoid climate breakdown, we have to cut world emissions at least in half by 2030, and get to zero by 2050. But this is a global average target.

Energy producers responsible for more than 80% of greenhouse gases in the Netherlands pay less tax on their emissions than ordinary households.

First of all, to those people mostly sitting here, who are always referring to the citizens to not be ambitious. Well, if there’s one thing that’s consistent over the last year – even in the middle of the pandemic – a large majority of our citizens want us to act to face the climate crisis. It is the citizens who are asking this of us: even in the middle of the pandemic, when they’re very much worried about their health, when they are very much worried about their jobs, they still see the climate crisis as something they want us to act upon. Secondly, in the same context, don’t come at me with ‘sovereignty – we need to do it at the national level’. Our citizens understand this is a problem we can only tackle on a global level, and that Europe needs to take the leadership as Europe. Individual Member States can no longer do that. Another remark in reaction to some of the criticisms: the costs. It’s expensive. Well, let me be very clear. If you look at our impact assessment, and to put it in layman’s terms: this is going to be bloody hard to do! It is hard to do, and we will ask sacrifice of everyone – industry, our citizens, the transport system, etc. It’s a tough job, but it can be done, and the sooner we start, the lower the cost. The sooner we start, the earlier the benefits. That’s why we had our target of -55% for 2030. So we shouldn’t hide the fact that this is going to be, as I said, bloody difficult to do – but just imagine for one second the cost of non-action. How are you going to go to a small town, such as Limone Piemonte, where they’ve just suffered the most horrible weather conditions and people have died and the village is a shambles, and tell them: no, it’s too costly, we won’t do this. What’s the cost of that? What’s the cost of another monthly gota fria in Valencia if we don’t do something about that? What’s the cost if people are saying: here, we should keep all these coal mines open, but there’s no market for the coal – what’s the cost of keeping people in jobs that have no future? The cost is huge. We need to help people find new jobs, retrain them – but show solidarity. That’s why Just Transition is essential. Without Just Transition there will just be no transition and we will never get to our -55% goal. Now of course, on the other side of the Chamber, you want a higher target. I maintain that -55 is difficult but feasible. I also maintain it is in line with our international obligations. I say this with force, because I do not like the argument that we should be doing more because other industrialised nations are doing less. We should be leading but also taking others along the way. I am quite sure that Xi Jinping saying that China will be carbon-neutral by 2060 is a consequence of what we’re doing, and we need to convince others. The fact that South Africa has now said: ‘we want to be climate-neutral by 2050’ – that’s huge for a country like South Africa. Let’s use that and create more international cooperation, and then -55, I think, is very important. A final point on using carbon sink. Look at the state of our forests. Look at what’s happening with biodiversity in Europe. If we continue like this, there will be no pollinators anymore. How are you going to explain that to the farmers when they say: ‘let’s keep the present agricultural policy’? There will be no agriculture if there are no pollinators. There will be no agriculture if there’s no water for the land. There will be no agriculture if a storm sweeps away the topsoil every time. And we need to look after our forests. Carbon sink is diminishing in Europe. We need to increase it. We need to look after the situation of our grasslands, our peatlands, our forests, and in that context, I believe it is wise to include carbon sink in our targets and to make sure we increase the health of our natural environment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 183, "date": "2020-10-06.json", "name": "Jytte GUTELAND", "mepid": "124991", "text": "  rapporteur. – Madam President, I would like to thank Executive Vice—President Timmermans for introducing this new chapter for the EU to become climate neutral. It is indeed a big change, it’s a historic moment and it is a new chapter that we are going to write together in the upcoming decades. I would like to paint a picture, inspired by a young climate activist who doesn’t need to be presented. I would like to paint a picture of a house that’s on fire. This planet is on fire and the young people, the young movement, noticed it and heard the alarm faster than many others. The scientists saw that the installation and the heating system is not functioning anymore. The conservatives say: ‘oh, but please keep it as it is because it was my daddy who actually installed it’. But that’s not a serious way to act when we have a problem with a system that is actually catching fire and already needs to have water put on it to make sure that we don’t have the catastrophe in some of the rooms that we already actually have. In the debate today we got many important messages from the Members. I would say that we have a big majority who see the necessity of doing more and who see that it’s not a sustainable way to keep giving subsidies to a system that is old. Therefore, we need to get rid of those fossil fuel subsidies by 2025 at the latest. Many also pointed out the necessity of doing it together. Yes, we need to do it together. It’s not OK if some Member States are not there helping out. Then the reparation will take further time, and we don’t have the time. Some others pointed out the importance of giving us more time. No, sorry, we don’t have that. A long reparation will actually endanger us more – all of us, all on this planet. Last but not least, it has been a privilege to work in this House together with the shadows. I would also, Commissioner, like to mention a shadow who is now going to be your colleague in the Commission, Ms McGuinness.
