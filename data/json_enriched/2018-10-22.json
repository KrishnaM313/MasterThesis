A total of 181 out of the 197 parties to the Convention have already deposited with the UN their instruments of ratification to what may be qualified as the most significant international agreement of the decade. Undoubtedly climate change is one of the most important challenges facing humanity. The recently released report from the IPCC on global warming of 1.5¬∞C indicates that climate risks are worse than we thought and that allowing global temperatures to rise by nearly 2¬∞C is not safe. The Paris Agreement was a major step, but a lot more needs to be done to ensure that this agreement will deliver on its intentions. In this House we all know from our work on European legislation that if it‚Äôs hard to agree on a common set of policies, it is even harder to implement them in a meaningful way. We are five weeks away from the start of the 24th climate conference in Katowice and it is shaping up to be a race against time to prepare the so-called Paris ‚Äòrule book‚Äô, which will govern how the climate agreement will actually be implemented. COP24 will be a key opportunity to take stock of progress made towards the agreement‚Äôs mitigation goal, and to inform the preparation and revision by 2020 of the parties‚Äô nationally determined contributions for 2030. We will also learn from the Talanoa Dialogue, which took place throughout this year. The European Union and its Member States are the largest provider of public climate finance, but the actual pledges by developed countries fall far short of the collective goal of USD¬†100¬†billion per year. The suspension of the US contributions to the Green Climate Fund will substantially widen up a hole we have all been working hard to fill in. These are all pertinent questions. We look forward to the discussions today with both the Council and the Commission, who will be sitting on the negotiation table in Poland in five weeks‚Äô time. As every year, in line with our commitment to the international climate process, the European Parliament will attend the Katowice Conference and follow the discussion and decisions made there. On Thursday this week we will adopt our resolution on the topic, which sets out the vision, concerns, expectations and aspirations of our institution. My colleagues will shortly present many of these in their interventions. But before I hand the floor to my colleagues, I would also like to raise the issue of biodiversity. Biodiversity decline is one of the biggest environmental challenges of our time. Unfortunately, the large majority of the 2020 Aichi Biodiversity Targets will not be met with the current trajectory of biodiversity loss. Given the intrinsic value of biodiversity and the essential contribution of ecosystem services to human wellbeing and economic prosperity, the protection of global biodiversity should receive the highest political attention. I would therefore urge the Commission and the Member States to commit to immediate, substantial and additional efforts on biodiversity conservation so as to meet the EU targets and halt the loss of biodiversity. I will leave it at that and conclude by saying that I look forward to a fruitful exchange with you all this afternoon, as well as a smooth cooperation between our institutions on these issues and, more specifically, in the run-up and during the climate negotiations in December.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 45, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Hartwig L√∂ger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. ‚Äì  Mr. President, dear Commissioner Ca√±ete, honourable Members of the Parliament, thank you very much for the opportunity to participate in this debate regarding two very important upcoming conferences. Allow me to first talk about the Katowice climate conference, before turning to the COP14 on Biological Diversity. As you are aware, only recently the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change special report on the impacts of global warming of 1.0¬∞ above pre-industrial levels constituted yet another scientific finding on the negative impacts of climate change. The Council conclusions adopted on 9¬†October fully recognise the urgency of the global response to the threat. The European Union and its Member States can lead by example. We have more than two decades of experience in designing and implementing climate policies to drive the transition to a low-greenhouse-gas-emissions economy, and this transition is happening while boosting growth and jobs, thanks to the development of clean technologies and low or zero carbon energy. The European Union is forging ahead with the implementation of its nationally-determined contribution, and the European Parliament has played a leadership role in promoting the high level of European Union ambition. In the recent periods, we have reached political agreement on the key legislative pillars of the 2030 climate and energy framework, including the emissions trading system, the effort sharing regulation, land use and forestry and also on targets for renewables, energy efficiency and governance of the energy union. We are committed to continuing our efforts on climate action and agree with this House that a clear and comprehensive Paris rulebook is absolutely vital. Concluding our work at COP24 and making the Paris agreement operational is critical for its effective and comprehensive implementation by parties as well as for their credibility on the UNFCCC process. The Talanoa dialogue taking place throughout 2018 is the first opportunity since Paris to look at our collective efforts to limit global warming and what we have done concretely in terms of delivering on the commitments made as well as opportunities to enhance ambition. The European Union and its Member States see this dialogue as one of the key processes this year. The European Union organised an ‚ÄòEU for Talanoa‚Äô event in Brussels in June with broad participation of policymakers and stakeholders. Member States, including Austria, organised their Talanoa events throughout the year. The European Union and its Member States are committed to continuing scaling up the mobilisation of international climate finance. The observed progression of EU climate finance over the past years is in line with the 2016 USD¬†100¬†billion roadmap. It represents a substantial contribution towards meeting this collective goal together with the other developed countries. Our public climate-specific finance has almost doubled in nominal terms over the last three years. The European Union and its Member States are collectively the largest provider of climate finance to developing countries, amounting to above EUR¬†20¬†billion in 2017. This figure includes contributions from public budgets and development finance institutions. It also includes 2.7¬†billion from the European Union budget and 1.9¬†billion from the European Investment Bank. The European Union is also a top contributor to multilateral funds and mechanisms. The EU and its Member States are the largest contributors to the Green Climate Fund, with a total of USD¬†4.7¬†billion committed, accounting for almost half of the total pledges made during the initial resource mobilisation. We have strongly supported the 7th replenishment of the Global Environment Facility with a commitment of about EUR¬†1.9¬†billion, accounting for over 50% of the total contributions.  Let me also stress the importance of making global finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development. Climate finance is a contribution towards this necessary global transition. The European Union is taking steps with its action plan in financing sustainable growth. As in the past, the Council counts on your sustained commitment. In this context I welcome also your resolution on the Katowice conference. President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, let me now turn to the COP14 on biological diversity. The Council agrees with the Parliament that the protection of global biodiversity is an essential challenge. Like the Parliament, the Council is greatly concerned that the natural resource-base and ecosystem services on which humanity depends are at a high risk and that pressures driving biodiversity loss continue to increase. Increased efforts are thus necessary from all parties and stakeholders to fully implement the strategic plan for biodiversity 2011 to 2020 and achieve its Aichi Biodiversity Targets. The Council shares the Parliament‚Äôs view that we need an ambitious follow-up to the strategic plan for biodiversity beyond 2020. It stresses that this should be an overarching biodiversity framework that places biodiversity and ecosystem services high on political agendas, strengthening the implementation of the Biodiversity Convention and its protocols and of other biodiversity related multilateral environmental agreements and relevant SDGs. The new framework should pave the way towards the achievement of the 2050 vision on biodiversity. Another important element of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework is resource mobilisation. It should include the mobilisation of resources from all sources, including from domestic resources and from the private sector, as well as the efficient and targeted use of available resources. As regards financial support for biodiversity, the Council believes that the Global Environment Facility Trust Fund has proven to be an important financing instrument for addressing drivers of environmental degradation and biodiversity loss and has a strong track record in delivering overall good project performance. The National Biodiversity strategies and action plans are and will remain the main instruments for implementing the Convention on Biodiversity and its protocols. Therefore it is crucial that Member States and all parties to the conventions increase their efforts to ensure their timely and effective implementation. Additional measures to complement and support the national strategies and action plans will be discussed on COP14 in Egypt, in the context of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 46, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Miguel ARIAS CA√ëETE", "mepid": "1351", "text": "   Member of the Commission. ‚Äì Mr¬†President, honourable Members, thank you for the opportunity to have this important debate as we look ahead to the preparations for the upcoming COP24 (Conference of the Parties) ‚Äì the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Katowice in Poland in December. The consequences of climate change are not a problem for others or for the future; impacts are already being felt ‚Äì devastation by floods, wildfires, heatwaves and hurricanes, including on our continent. Two weeks ago, the Special Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change on the impacts of global warming of 1.5¬∞C above pre-industrial levels was released, and the report highlights the extreme urgency of climate action and the need to do more to reduce emissions in all sectors in order to limit global warming. Against this backdrop, the European Union envisages three broad deliverables for COP24, which are reflected also in the COP24 Council Conclusions adopted on 9¬†October and endorsed by the European Council last week. Firstly, we must conclude the Paris Work Programme, which concerns the detailed governance rules for the implementation of the Paris Agreement. Securing this outcome is necessary to make the Paris Agreement operational. Secondly, at the political phase of the Talanoa Dialogue, Ministers will reflect on the adequacy of the current contributions and of international cooperation for climate action, and the insights from the recent IPCC 1.5¬∞ Special Report should be an important element in the discussion. The outcome of the Talanoa Dialogue should be a commitment of all parties to enhance their efforts to deliver the Paris commitments and to reflect on their level of ambition in view of informing the update or confirmation of the nationally-determined contributions by 2020 in line with the Paris Agreement. Thirdly, the European Union attaches great importance to the other high-level events in Katowice. We are looking forward to the high-level ministerial dialogue on climate finance and the stocktake on pre-2020 implementation and ambition to showcase progress and identify opportunities for action. We are contributing towards the developed countries‚Äô collective goal of mobilising USD¬†100-billion per year by 2020 to address the needs of developing countries. In 2017, the Commission and the European Investment Bank contributed approximately EUR¬†5.5¬†billion of climate finance to developing countries. That is encouraging, but we must continue to catalyse and accelerate action from all economic actors to reach the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

Although less visible in the media, the global biodiversity crisis has social and economic implications known to be as serious as the climate crisis. Indeed, the two global challenges are intrinsically linked. This Commission has already done a lot to tackle the problem and the work to scale up efforts will continue right through to the end of our current mandate.  Let me mention, in particular, the Action Plan for nature, people and the economy, to accelerate implementation of the EU nature directives; the EU initiative to tackle the decline of pollinators; two guidance documents on integrating ecosystem services in decision-making and on EU-level green infrastructure, to be adopted soon; and ongoing work on a second update of the Union List of Invasive Alien Species of Union concern. I would also highlight the important work we are doing to engage the private sector in this issue under the EU Business¬†@¬†Biodiversity Platform and through the Natural Capital Financing Facility, which has strong synergies with the concrete proposals adopted by this Commission under the Sustainable Finance Package. Building on these instruments, coupled with efforts to tackle climate change, including through transforming development aid policy and increased investments in Africa, should in future help to leverage more effectively the resources and commitments needed to address global biodiversity decline. We are also tackling the problem at international level through other means, namely our Action Plan against Wildlife Trafficking and our work on Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT). Member States also have important responsibilities and the Commission will continue supporting their efforts whilst continuing to ensure compliance with EU nature legislation. For the period after 2020, the Commission has proposed an enhanced LIFE programme that will notably include a stronger focus on nature and biodiversity. Most importantly, given the crucial importance of sound agricultural policy to reverse biodiversity decline, as you know, the Commission has adopted a new legislative proposal on the common agricultural policy (CAP) post-2020, which includes higher climate and environmental ambitions. It will be of utmost importance that this House fully backs these ambitions. With regard to the post-2020 global biodiversity framework, the Commission concurs with the Council‚Äôs conclusions of 9¬†October that the framework should include targets that are, as far as possible, measurable and time-bound, an adequate monitoring framework and voluntary commitments from parties, citizens and the private sector, accompanied by a mechanism to review their implementation and to ensure accountability. This should be accompanied by an action agenda that mobilises non-state actors, communication campaigns and the political process at the highest levels. These elements should significantly strengthen global biodiversity policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 48, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Norbert LINS", "mepid": "124808", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners, a warm welcome to the Council too!

We take this opportunity to reiterate and reinforce the importance of protecting our biodiversity worldwide. Together with colleagues from the other groups, we therefore believe it is essential to strengthen efforts and to draw up an ambitious strategic plan for the post-2020 period with a view to 2050. That is why, in our motion for a resolution, we call on the European Commission and the Member States to continue to take the lead in protecting biodiversity. To this end, it is important to step up efforts to achieve the 2020 targets, to introduce a stronger implementation mechanism similar to that in Paris and to ensure adequate funding. In the resolution, we deal with six points, two of which I would like to mention explicitly: our call for a robust international framework for the post-2020 period ‚Äì we are in favour of performance indicators, which is also a key point for the effectiveness of the 2050 strategic plan ‚Äì and, in particular, the highlighting of the positive contributions of forestry and agriculture to biodiversity.

Poland strongly supports this agreement and the amendment, which I will table on behalf of the EKR, remains in the spirit of this agreement. It clarifies that our aim is to strike a balance between emissions and removal capacity, as defined by the Paris Agreement.

Mr President, I would like to thank the I greet the Commissioners as much as I greet the Council and, of course, my dear colleagues. We have just heard about climate change and the mountain region. I want to go into the wet and talk about what climate change means for the oceans. The oceans are hugely important to us. Every second breath comes from the sea, where oxygen is produced, and less can be produced if climate change continues. Because it is also the case that CO2 can be bound by the seas. So here, too, the seas ‚Äì healthy seas ‚Äì have an important climate function. Now it is the case that, for example, the melting of the ice caps at the pole ‚Äì the Greenland ice is also melting ‚Äì just changes the water: it becomes less salty. As a result, it sinks less quickly to the ground, and there is therefore a changed exchange of fresh water. This in turn influences the Gulf Stream, which also makes our climate. It will change sooner or later, because the Gulf Stream has already slowed down and is also changing in shape, something that has been the case for almost millennia ‚Äì not for millennia, but has been so for a long time: in Europe it could get colder, on the east coast of North America warmer. And of course, this also has an impact on the biodiversity that exists in the zones: fishing and much more. One more thing: we have just heard about the coral reefs. At 1.5¬∞ many coral reefs are already dying, at 2¬∞ they will die. And now you can say: Well, then you can not see such beautiful colorful fish while diving. But that is not the point. The point is really that the coral reefs are a haven for many species that live and grow up in the sea, and at the same time a bulwark against natural disasters such as tsunamis or other. They therefore also have a protective function for the respective continents. The last thing: When sea levels rise, islands will disappear. You can say: Well, a few islands less. But, of course, as Mrs Van Brempt has already mentioned, there will then be climate refugees, and that will therefore have a major impact on this too. The sea level rises very differently depending on where you are on the globe. So the ocean is very important for people, and that is why we should make sure that we get to grips with climate change.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 52, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Bas EICKHOUT", "mepid": "96725", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. ‚Äì Mr¬†President, I think that it is very good that we are discussing climate and biodiversity at the same time, because we all know that we have global pledges on the table, but Europe is not on track in meeting those pledges.

The EU needs this same determination at COP24, especially now that there is a leadership vacuum to fill following the US withdrawal from Paris. Climate action isn‚Äôt easy. It requires governments to make radical changes to their economies. My country, Ireland, especially must ensure that all of its policy areas are coherent with reaching our climate targets. On a global, EU and national scale, we are way off track.

Halting biodiversity loss, not only on land but also in our oceans, must become more than just a goal. I agree with those of you who said that to really make it happen, we need to shift up a gear by building on financial instruments and optimising policies such as development aid to put in place a solid process for voluntary commitments that can attract adequate resources, together with clear, quantifiable global targets. Ongoing scientific work will help us better understand and quantify the biological and economic implications of living within planetary boundaries. This should put us in a better position to translate policy objectives into operational and effective measures. Of course, we will also need to mobilise adequate resources to achieve our goals. This is an investment that is necessary and urgent, considering that the cost of inaction is increasing exponentially. Consequential social and economic costs are not simply an ambiguous concept. We know for a fact that biodiversity loss has direct links to human displacement, migration and global security concerns linked to food and water. The conservation and restoration of biodiversity can therefore be a powerful antidote to these challenges. We have started our preparatory work with the evaluation of the EU biodiversity strategy to 2020, including plans for stakeholder consultation. This will contribute to the discussions on the post-2020 Global Framework. We need to rise up to this opportunity and take a lead in encouraging global partners to act with us. I am confident that with your support and the support of EU citizens, we can make the COP¬†15 in Beijing in 2020 a game changer. On the 2018 UN Climate Change Conference, strong and united European Union messaging will be instrumental to continue to deliver on our leadership during COP¬†24 in Katowice and beyond. The European Commission and the Council, under the leadership of the Austrian Presidency, will contribute to the conclusion of the negotiations on the Paris work programme, so as to enable the Paris agreement to be fully implemented and global progress on curbing emissions to be tracked transparently and regularly. After Katowice, our work must continue both domestically and internationally. With our domestic experience and external policy instruments and dialogues, we are in a position to help our partners to advance their transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient economy. We should also assume a leadership position in prompting our partners to develop their long-term strategies if possible already ahead of the climate summit, which is to be convened by UN Secretary General Guterres in September¬†2019, or in any case for 2020 as foreseen under the Paris agreement.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for this debate that we can have today on the draft budget that we will be voting on Wednesday in this House. I think I can say, representing the sentiments of my fellow Members who worked with me in the Committee on Budgets ‚Äì which I would like to thank, of course, also and above all the shadow rapporteurs who have worked with me ‚Äì I think I can represent everyone's feeling by saying that we have presented a budget proposal that is both ambitious but also sustainable.  Sustainable because we are not asking the Member States for additional efforts compared to those they already make in supporting the financial framework and supporting the budget of our European Union, and because we are trying to use all the resources at our disposal, we want to use all the resources at our disposal to return them to the citizens of Europe. Ambitious because we are trying to respond to all European citizens with the proposals we want to make, as well as to businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises that are suffering, and above all to the most innovative companies; we try to give important answers to our universities, to our local administrations (the regions and municipalities), and we try to give answers to our research institutions. Just as we are trying ‚Äì through the budget that we have written and will vote on, I think and hope with a large majority on Wednesday ‚Äì to respond to the great challenges that await us and that await our continent: growth, solidarity between states but also solidarity with citizens, as well as the great issue of migration, which seems to no longer abandon the debate of our countries and the debate of european citizens. On migration, we are trying not to give the first answers, You see, Mr President, but let us try to deal with the problems as they need to be dealt with, that is, point by point and sector by sector, by trying to give overall answers or, as we say in this House, a holistic response. Let us try to give an answer that includes all the sectors of these phenomena because, above all, we will try to give answers that are supportive responses but that are also preventive actions. That is why we have also focused a great deal on preventive actions. We have also focused a great deal ‚Äì and my fellow Members know this ‚Äì on the subject of eradication, that is, trying to remove the reasons for migration and then try to remove, defeat, fight poverty, try to defeat drought, try to defeat the reasons why there are migrations. And then our biggest challenge, Mr President: the younger generation. A great commitment in our budget is on the younger generations, in particular on the Erasmus project, which is not only a symbolic project of our Europe but must become, from next year as well as in the years to come, a project to which all young people and young people on our continent can join. And then there is the Youth Guarantee: because the greatest concern of all of us can only be unemployment, the enormous youth unemployment that runs through our country. I am not na√Øve, of course, Mr President, I know that this is a first step, I know that a first step is now beginning, and I think that the others should take them with the Commission that accompanies us, and I thank Commissioner Oettinger for that, and with the Council, I thank you for the very close attention that Mr Loger is putting into the formation of this budget. The question we must ask ourselves, Minister, that we must all ask ourselves in the coming weeks and months, before closing the budget, is that Europe and what image of Europe we want to give back to the citizens of Europe before the next elections: whether a Europe that still looks at the 'zero commas', whether a Europe that is only attentive to measures with neighbouring percentages, etc., or whether a Europe that looks to the great challenges and the future. These are the questions that we will have to answer and if we answer together, in my opinion, we will find the right answer to give to the citizens, returning to the values, traditions and bets that we face.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 92, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Paul R√úBIG", "mepid": "2278", "text": "  Rapporteur. Madam President, Federal Minister L√∂ger, Commissioner Oettinger, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for his excellent work and for her excellent work. We have an important year ahead of us. 2019 will be the first year in which we have to fix the multiannual financial framework, the new financial framework. That is why it is crucial that the priorities that Mr Viotti has just mentioned here should be taken into account in the negotiations. We will only be voting this week on what the European Parliament's position is, but the political groups have already discussed many details and we are already quite agreed that we want to set some priorities for next year, such as the design of Horizon 2020, the COSME programme, youth, migration, research, connecting Europe facility, the issue of security ‚Äì so there are many points. , where I believe that it also makes sense to reach an agreement with the Council, because, of course, the European added value for next year ‚Äì we will have elections next year ‚Äì can also be brought to the citizens' understanding accordingly. Finally, it is also a question of showing what it costs us ‚Äì namely the citizens and the taxpayers ‚Äì if Europe does not do it. The cost of non-Europe is a very important issue, which we should also communicate more widely in public, because it is also a question of showing in subsidiarity at what level which decisions should be taken. These decisions are very important for our future, bearing in mind that the defence of democracy also has a value ‚Äì unity in diversity ‚Äì and that is why the Erasmus programme should also be designed for groups working to defend democracy in Europe. But that brings me to my specific budget, which are the other sections, as it is so beautifully called. It is the ten institutions that, in addition to the Commission, shape Europe and shape Europe. Perhaps I will start with the European Parliament. This is the House that represents the citizens of Europe, and it is important for us that we also show to the governments that we have common objectives. I am actually very happy that the European Parliament has decided to keep heading V below 20% again today, which is actually our red line. In fact, for fifteen years now, we have had the lowest share of heading V that has ever existed, namely 18.53 %. This is the lowest figure in the last fifteen years. I believe that Parliament is already showing here that we are also prepared to make savings. We have also chosen to have lump sums for Members and for officials and our staff in various areas. We can also save ourselves enormous costs from the flat-rate costs, which have now been confirmed by the European Court of Justice, because, of course, a fact-check would require a great many new posts and therefore the flat-rate allowance is actually the right approach for us, including in the personal responsibility of Members towards the public. We have a number of Members in the House who are calling for more and more transparency in this area. I can only encourage colleagues to be transparent, but put your bills on the Internet for all lump sums. You have the opportunity to present this on your own homepage accordingly. I have taken a closer look at this this summer: there is not a single Member in the House who publishes supporting documents, and I think that is also right, because, of course, the flat rate justifies the cost of having it further in the future. I am also in favour of a closer look at the voluntary pension fund. I am also calling for a study by the Court of Auditors. I believe that a solution must be found that respects the Members' Statute. That is why it is also a question of giving the European Court of Justice and the External Action Service additional resources accordingly. There are new challenges here. Finally, it is a question of the European Parliament also having fulfilled the 5% reduction in posts. This is now reflected in the 2019 budget accordingly. I can also say that, of course, the election year has given us slightly increased costs. All in all, however, I am very satisfied with the way in which the current proposals are being made by the Council, the Commission and, of course, the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 93, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Hartwig L√∂ger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Madam President, Commissioner Oettinger and ladies, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for her excellent work. It is an honour for me to be here today to follow Parliament's debate on the 2019 budget.  I myself had the opportunity, a month ago, to comment on the Commission and the Council's proposal in the form of the Council, in relation to the Commission's proposal, and I concluded at the time that we share a common basis on the essential points of our proposals ‚Äì the priorities that we want to set together for this Europe. We have in the priorities together a growing, innovative and competitive economy, which we are making a priority of, and at the same time we want to give young people in Europe in particular a new opportunity so that they can reach their full potential.  In their proposal i presented, the Member States are prepared to finance a substantial increase in the budget compared to previous years in order to meet these challenges. The Council itself proposes that the current budget should be increased by more than 2%, which is a much higher basis than the national budgets of many countries. As Finance Minister, I am confronted every day‚Äì including in my country ‚Äì with the fact that, of course, there must also be awareness that state budgets are financed by taxpayers and that we also have a responsibility in the decisions that we take here in this context. Ladies and gentlemen! I would also like us to take note of the fact that, particularly in the Council proposal, the issue of science occupies a very, very important place and that we also see it as an opportunity to promote social peace and job security in Europe. We also want to ensure that the people of Europe find a faster way ‚Äì both at the level of the Internet, but also in traditional transport routes. And we also want to ensure that migration, as one of Europe's greatest challenges, has appropriate support.  To put it more specifically, we have therefore provided in our proposal for a 10% increase for the Erasmus programme, a significant increase in the horizon 2020 area, 30% more also for data networks and transport networks, and a significant increase in funding for migration. However, it must also be clear to us that we can only set these priorities if we also deal carefully with the other areas of Europe's financial resources. I can only repeat that this 2019 budget must also be designed efficiently, modernly and appropriately in order to create this space for priorities. We also want to provide sufficient margins to deal with unforeseen situations. We are all realising that not only Brexit within Europe, but also of global frameworks, pose major challenges, and we should also take responsibility for the citizens of Europe in this context to include the financial resources for this.  I believe that it is particularly important, in connection with the discussion of this budget, to respect the decisions taken in the past. We have a multiannual financial framework, we have the mid-term review, but we have also made financial arrangements in connection with legislative proposals. I also appeal to you in this context to respect these requirements. I myself am sure that we can keep the timetable that we have set ourselves, which was also agreed between our institutions for the budget negotiations. In doing so, we also want to ensure that we can reach an agreement within the deadlines set in the Treaty.

Madam President, Mr President of the Council, Minister L√∂ger, honourable Members, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. First of all, I would like to express my respect to the rapporteurs, Mr Viotti and Mr R√ºbig, for excellent preparatory work here in this House for a position that you are discussing and deciding on this week. The Council, Parliament and the Commission ‚Äì we are in agreement on the priorities that we want to achieve, want to improve, and strengthen with budgetary resources. It is about economic strength and growth, it is about jobs and jobs, especially for young people, it is about meaningful projects in the field of migration, it is about external and internal security. I would also like to thank you, Minister L√∂ger, for showing through your presence that it is a matter for you to take part in these negotiations in 2019 and, with all due respect to your officials, to be responsible for themselves. Thank you for the hours you are here and are ready to spend the next few weeks with us actively in the interests of an orderly adoption. There is still a difference in the need for funding for the programmes that we are currently focusing on. The allocation of funds for the priorities must therefore be given expert and thorough advice in the coming weeks. However, I welcome the goodwill and willingness to reach agreement, for cooperation, which has so far been shown by all the budgetary authorities. The timetable for mid-November is clear, and I see a good chance of reaching an agreement in this period, which we have jointly defined by the sequence of meetings. What are the most important questions for consultation? Firstly, competitiveness. Parliament is proposing an increase that goes beyond the Commission's draft when it comes to programmes for SMEs, young people, climate protection and competitiveness. The Council wants to increase programmes such as Horizon 2020 or Connecting Europe, if compared to 2018, if the Commission's proposal is taken, to cut back somewhat. We will be able to provide further advice in the coming weeks along projects for which funding is requested and through ongoing and new research projects. I believe that research and innovation, that the promotion of SMEs are crucial for European competitiveness, should be indisputable in this House and between all three institutions. In particular, we see programmes with a high European added value at Connecting Europe and Horizon 2020, where it makes sense to bring funds to the European level and then invest together. That is why we are convinced that the Council's cuts of EUR 800 million are not really comprehensible and are contrary to these jointly stated priorities. We must all be clear: those who declare priorities must also be prepared to say where they do not prioritise, where cuts are also accepted. The employment situation for young people in Europe has improved. This affects most regions, but not all regions. That is why the programmes that we are now continuing to finance are about accuracy and the question: what can actually be implemented by the Member States and the local administrative authorities? The appropriation only makes sense if it is ambitious but also realistic. That is why, for both the Youth Work Initiative and the Social Fund, we will be listing in the coming weeks exactly what size of implementation we consider to be realistic. In the case of Erasmus+, agreement should be easy. It makes sense to increase this and serves to get young people to get to know Europe and therefore also to support Europe on the path of their future lives. The third priority is external action and migration. In September, the Commission presented a new migration package with which we intend to take the first steps towards strengthening Frontex, the Border and Coast Guard. We think it is very important that This is supported by Parliament. The Facility for Refugees in Turkey. In retrospect, I would like to tell you that, despite an EU-unfriendly policy by the government in Ankara, the funds arrive one-to-one where temporary refugees are housed. We are funding human dignity for 1.2 million refugees. The first instalment has been allocated and used up. That is why our concern as the Commission is on the question of who finances what, above all, one thing: we cannot allow ourselves to delay, we should keep our word, we need another EUR 3 billion for the second tranche, so that this funding of human dignity for the number of refugees continues without interruption, for example by employing 8 000 teachers to ensure that young people are able to do so. - 300 000 in number - education, basic education remains possible. We should not be blunt about the issue with Ankara, keep our word in the interests of the people who are important to all of us. With the pre-accession aid to Turkey, for which my colleague Mr Hahn is in charge and where, in addition to the cuts proposed by the Commission, both the Council and Parliament propose further cuts, my idea is as follows: we should only invest, but just as much, as is still possible in projects for democracy, for the rule of law, for civil society, for the order of values, for NGOs. This means that the more and the sooner we have projects and contacts that go in the right direction ‚Äì providing money for this makes sense. We do not need more than that. We sent you a letter of amendment a few days ago. This is about the usual adjustment of agricultural expenditure in the autumn, environmental and climate objectives, and smaller changes which are more technical. Then, with our letter of amendment, we also translated recently adopted legislative proposals into figures. The new programme for industrial development in the defence sector, the European Solidarity Corps, the programme to support structural reforms and also three new Commission proposals: an increase of 750 posts next year from Frontex, the strengthening of the European Agency for Asylum and ten posts for the work of our parties and foundations are included in these amendments.

However, there is one negative element which will have far-reaching consequences for candidate country Turkey, as has already been mentioned by the Commissioner. We all agree that political developments in Turkey are not doing well and, therefore, the Commission‚Äôs decision to cut 40% of the Instrument for Pre-accession Assistance (IPA II) envelope is extreme but justifiable.

Every euro we invest in cohesion policy delivers a return on investment of 174%. Less investment in cohesion policy means lower growth and fewer jobs.

Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Mr Oettinger, I would like to thank commissioner for his excellent work and for his excellent work. Your proposal for the 2019 budget provided for an increase in the budget of around 3% compared to 2018. This sum has now been increased by EUR 700 million in the Committee on Budgets. I believe that it is the wrong signal to simply keep calling for more money, without, quite specifically, giving life to the priorities that are being set.  There are good reasons to spend more money on some areas. The areas of security, migration, energy policy, but also innovation and research deserve to be funded generously. However, this does not necessarily mean that you have to spend more money at the same time. Of course, there are also ways of freeing up money elsewhere by redeploying and saving, so that you don't need more money. I think it is a fallacy when Mr Fernandes, for example, has just said that it is a case of joining forces when we are there for the citizens and spend more money. It has to be said that this money that is to be spent here is taken from the citizens beforehand ‚Äì taken away by taxes. This money does not fall from the sky. I am therefore convinced that the citizens will thank us if we use this money very sparingly.  That is what we should do, and we should also define the measures that we want to implement in a measurable way and then have the courage to say afterwards: have these purposes actually made a difference, or have these objectives been achieved at all? That is quite crucial. We cannot simply define measures that look beautiful on paper.  I believe that we must finally do more for subsidiarity in the budgetary field too. The EU should not be responsible for all sorts of things.

First of all, I welcome Mr Viotti's commitment to youth, because in the face of the dramatic increase in applications under the Erasmus programme, a victim of its success, the Council's position remains well below and is almost indecent in the face of needs. Similarly, youth unemployment in Europe continues to peak at 15%. The youth employment programmes and the European Social Fund are now recognised as powerful tools. I therefore welcome my colleagues' proposal to spend an additional EUR 580 million on the Youth Employment Initiative. The same goes for rural development, which is subject to a reduction of more than EUR 310 million in commitments compared to the Commission's project, which was already drastically cutting the funds allocated to this envelope. Yet agricultural policies can be structuring in the fight against climate change, even when we do not even reach the 20% commitments made even before the signing of the Paris conference. I therefore welcome the rapporteurs' proposal to increase this envelope by EUR 20 million.  Similarly, we must strongly support their proposal to speed up the implementation of the programmes of political cohesion, which are consubstantial of the Union - I would even say that are the DNA of the European Union - and which forge the solidarity of our territories and our citizens. The proposals put forward by the Commission and the Council are neither up to the ambitions nor up to the needs that the European Union must meet in these times of crisis of confidence.

I recognise that it is, of course, a question of perspective whether you want to see an increase in this Council proposal of 2%, or whether you are talking about cuts, so to speak, in line with the Commission's proposal here or there. I believe that it will be necessary to find this common perspective on the various issues. And I also think I can speak from experience that it will be necessary to talk about one side of costs and the other side of investment. It will be up to all of us to make a clear distinction between where we have the opportunity to save ‚Äì in the responsibility of the citizens ‚Äì and where we have a shared responsibility to make investments that also add value to the European Union and, above all, to added value for taxpayers and, therefore, all Europeans in this form. I am pleased that, in view of the political framework for the 2019 EU election, we are also going into the discussion of the next few weeks in a responsible and sensible way, and I can see my visit here in Parliament today as a positive investment for myself, because I am confident that these many contributions will continue to be implemented well in the coming weeks.

I would like to make two very, very quick reflections, since I cannot go into the substance of the individual issues. Minister, I am not telling you, Commissioner Oettinger has told you this and other Members have told you that there are cuts in the budget presented by the Commission, there are no increases. We can always play the game of seeing the glass half full or half empty: we see it half empty, you probably see it half full. It is in the middle, exactly, we have to decide whether that glass is half full or half empty, but the Commissioner tells him and we tell him: these funds are not enough. We need a budget that really meets the needs that already exist today and which the Commission has highlighted.  Thank you for your reference to compliance with the agreements. This Parliament has always respected the agreements and intends to respect them again from now on. In conclusion, on the subject of agreements, I would like to thank Commissioner Oettinger, who wanted to address the issue of the refugee instrument for Turkey, a measure which we fully support and on which, here too, we want to refer and we want to refer to the agreements that have already taken place between the institutions, that is to say in the first version proposed by the Commission. Finally, on the issue of emergencies, Minister, emergencies are dealt with with emergency funds, they are not dealt with by setting aside money for emergencies that we do not know if there will be, hoping that they will never be there.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the shadow rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, let me now thank the negotiating team of this Parliament and the services of the European Commission for the work we have done together. Tomorrow we will vote on the report on the revision of the Directive on the quality of drinking water in Europe. The aim of this directive is to revise the quality parameters of drinking water and to propose a new method of risk assessment to prevent the dangers and risks of pollutants further upstream. Almost 20 years after its entry into force, the revision of the Drinking Water Directive is now needed to align quality parameters with advances in science and to take into account emerging substances. I believe that we have adopted in the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety a coherent report which defends the interests of European citizens, takes into account the strong constraints of suppliers, Member States and local authorities, but also strongly supports the European Commission's risk-based approach. We all agree: access to quality water is a necessity for Europe, a necessity for its citizens. Promoting access to quality water for European citizens at an affordable cost, in full transparency towards the European consumer, is also a requirement that we can share. This report therefore presents several major issues: access to water, public accountability and finally the quality parameters required by the revised directive. With regard to access to water, the provision of quality water is, of course, a priority that we share, but I regret that the European Commission has included the issue of access to water in the revision of the Drinking Water Directive, thus blurring the first message on the quality of water distributed in Europe. Too many citizens still unjustly doubt the quality of tap water. Of course, our Member States are different in their institutional functioning and in their physical reality, and we must take this diversity into account.  Parliament's report is already going beyond the European Commission's ambitions for access to water by proposing that Member States promote universal access to water, i.e. access to water for all in the European Union. I am pleased to have succeeded in integrating this balance which respects the principle of subsidiarity and which I will be able to defend in the trilogue negotiations. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has spoken out in favour of increasing transparency and public information on the quality of distributed water. The quality and price of water are elements that must be brought to the consumer's attention, both to preserve the resource and to promote the consumption of tap water before bottled water. However, I would like to draw the attention of the European Commission and the Council to the fact that the objective of transparency must be at the service of water quality and consumer education and not the disclosure of sensitive information, both from an economic and strategic point of view, which presents in the context in which we currently live , a security risk. With regard to quality parameters, I regret, ladies and gentlemen, that the World Health Organisation, the institution of reference for pollutants and health protection, has not had more echoes in the original proposal and in the debates in the European Parliament. In a particularly sensitive context in terms of health security, the challenge for the European institutions today is to assess the risks associated with each pollutant as best as possible. I find it surprising, to say the least, that WHO, which is often used as a reference by our institution for more constraints, is now short-circuited by those who wish to amend the report in order to reduce the reference value for some of the hazardous substances, particularly chemical compounds such as endocrine disruptors and perfluorates. In conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, I think it is time to revise a directive that is so important to our people after 20 years - yes 20 years. Ladies and gentlemen, the ideal can bring us together, pragmatism and realism may divide us; to move forward, I join this second camp.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 143, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. ‚Äì Madam¬†President, I would like to first warmly thank MEP Michel Dantin and all the shadow rapporteurs for the hard work done on the proposal for a revised Drinking Water Directive. The Commission welcomes the European Parliament‚Äôs work and the fact that the European Parliament‚Äôs amendments are largely aligned with the main elements of our proposal. I would like to recall that the main objective of our proposal is to ensure the safety of drinking water in the European Union for the 21st century. We should be proud that today, most people living in the EU enjoy drinking water that is of the highest standards worldwide. This is the result of over thirty years of successful EU drinking water policies and rules. The proposal builds on this success but recognises that change is necessary if we want to ensure that this remains the case for the next 20 years. Besides, it fulfils the Commission‚Äôs response to the citizens‚Äô Right2Water initiative. It is very important that you get a mandate from the plenary tomorrow to start trilogues. In this respect, I can assure you that the Commission is doing its utmost to help the Austrian Presidency and Member States to reach a common ground so that negotiations can start as soon as possible. Let me also underline that, in acting as an honest broker to facilitate an agreement between the co-legislators, the Commission would uphold the important objective of this proposal, which I believe we all share. I know that on some issues, political opinions differ, such as the question of how best to ensure access to water and the issue of the strictness of health standards. These questions are crucial for European citizens, and the solutions we propose will bring positive change to their daily life. I have taken good note of the latest amendments tabled. Let me therefore once again call on the Parliament to support the Commission‚Äôs ambition to protect even better the health of our citizens by proposing strict health standards.

I think most of us take it for granted that when we turn on the tap, the tap water in our glass will be clean, safe and high quality, so of course, protecting public health and the safety of the public must be the foremost objective of this Directive, and that ºs the leading priority for my Group. On endocrine disruptors, the S&amp;D Group pushed, as we have done for a number of years, for stronger protections by bringing those substances into the formal parametric values. On PFAS substances we have been clear that stronger action is needed, and we are determined to see controls of microplastics in water as well. We must also take this opportunity, in my view, to not just criticise water suppliers for unacceptable leakage rates; we must also mandate action with targets to reduce leakage. Leakage is bad for customers. It sees bills going up ‚Äì 2.4 billion litres of water is wasted in my own Member State every single day ‚Äì so I applaud the GMB Trade Union ºs campaign to take back the tap, to get water in the UK back in public hands, working in the interests of people and not shareholder dividends.

Water is a basic prerequisite for life. The UN General Assembly declared clean water a human right in 2010 and the EU Citizens' Initiative on the subject gathered more than 1.8 million signatures. That is why we must strive to guarantee access to high-quality water at affordable prices for all citizens.  The purpose of the report is to update the Drinking Water Directive 1998 to reflect the present day. The updated directive harmonises drinking water quality standards so that they are based on the latest scientific data, in line with the recommendations of the World Health Organisation.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for his work and for the way in which We have impeccable drinking water in Europe. In an audit of data from 15 Member States in 2015, the Commission found that the compliance rate of microbiological and chemical parameters is 99%.  With our report, we are making a significant contribution to ensuring that this remains the case in the years to come, despite new challenges such as microplastics and drug residues. I very much welcome the fact that we are significantly expanding consumer information. We can be proud of our good tap water. Unfortunately, this has not always been the case with consumers.  However, it is also important to me that water suppliers can implement the directive in practice. Water supply varies widely between Member States. We must take this into account and must not put obstacles in the way of tried and tested forms of organisation, such as the supply of water in municipal hands.  With this in mind, I have tabled amendments on two issues for tomorrow's vote. Firstly, I would like to propose that the tried and tested system of measuring frequency, Annex II, Part B, be maintained. In accordance with the principle of proportionality, this allows for an exact adaptation of the measuring frequencies to the size of the water supplier. The amendments proposed by the Commission and the committee would lead to significant cost increases for some water suppliers, without any ultimately improvement in health protection. Secondly, I propose that the additional information requirements for large water suppliers in Annex IV be limited to information directly related to water quality. Information on energy and cost-efficiency is in the wrong place in this directive.

First, water quality: it is essential to protect health and take into account all that is nitrate, drug residues, pesticides, endocrine disruptors, etc. But I would like to include the perfluorates - PFAS (polyfluoroalkyles and perfluoroalkyles) - as a whole, and not to distinguish, as you do, Mr Dantin, long and short chains.

We want to strengthen consumer confidence and encourage the use of water coming out of our taps, but when setting parameters that increase water quality we must be careful not to overdo it and not to make water consumption impossible in some European areas.

Secondly, it is quality, it is not only about clean water, but also, of course, it is also about water that is free from, for example, endocrine disruptors. Or, for example, the issue of microplastics. Next, it is sustainability, the ability to supply this available water to citizens, but also the sustainability of the whole system. This means that the system should be able to respond to new technologies, while ensuring that the available water does not dramatically increase household costs. Another is transparency, i.e. predictability of the water supply system and predictability of water quality as such. The last one for me is a partnership project, i.e. partnerships with municipalities and towns.

An invention that changed everything, it must be said, that changed the products, that changed the quantities and that changed mainly our behaviors, with the advent of the all-disposable. Today, this story is turning into a nightmare: 8 billion tons produced in less than 65 years for 6 billion tons of waste. The figures are staggering: more than 400,000 tonnes a year for Europe alone. Everywhere, the oceans have become our last garbage can and they are dying of it. The images loop around all the media: our beaches disfigured by waste, cormorants smothered by plastic bags, sea turtles whose stomachs are colonized by pieces of plastic ... These images are unbearable. The Commission therefore proposes to cover the ten disposable plastic objects that are most often found on our beaches, plus fishing equipment, which together accounts for 70% of marine waste. And the 51 Members of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety who supported my report in the vote have a realistic objective - I want to stress this - which is to ban this single-use plastic when a sustainable alternative exists, such as paper, bamboo, glass, corn starch, etc. At the same time, it will stimulate innovation and create jobs in Europe. The Commission goes so far as to talk about 50,000 jobs. It is also a matter of putting in place a series of progressive measures, an obligation, especially for producers, to take responsibility, labelling certain products that are difficult to recycle, awareness campaigns and, of course, ambitious measures to reduce the consumption of certain items. As rapporteur, I have wished, together with the shadow rapporteurs, that I will not all name here but whom I would like to thank very sincerely for the excellence of our cooperation, so we wish to raise the level of ambition of the Commission's proposal. To this end, we have added three products to the original list of prohibitions - this one is known - cotton rods, straws, plates, cutlery, touillettes. In this case, we add expanded polystyrene packaging, which is found in fast food, oxdegradable bags, which fragment under the influence of light and therefore contribute to marine pollution, as well as ultralight bags, i.e. bags of less than 15 microns, while maintaining a derogation mainly for reasons of hygiene. And I will make a small comment on this: I clearly do not have the same reading line as some colleagues who, through deletions, derogations, attack the very heart of our text and try to save plates or cutlery made in southern Italy, or German balloons. I would like to make it clear that the text does not provide for a ban on balloons and, as I have read today, to address the pleasure of children. This type of argument is Euroscepticism. It is not in the text, and I come back to that text. Where we have not banned, we propose a robust legal framework, a timetable to reduce the consumption of food containers and cups; the EPP is tabling a plenary amendment here to immediately reduce consumption of these two products by 25%, to which I fully agree. The signal sent to the Member States is the right one. On the other hand, I am opposed to Amendment 122, which exempts SMEs completely until 2023 and paves the way, it is obvious, for all abuses and legal optimisations. With regard to plastic bottles, we are adding, to the 90% separate collection target, a target of collecting 35% recycled content by 2025, some industry champions are already there. For fishing devices, nets, ropes, etc., which are responsible for 27% of marine pollution, this is a priority. I reinforce the Commission's text by drawing on the best practices that come to us from Norway and Iceland, experts, if any. The Commission on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety has also followed me in my willingness to take into account the fight against the environmental damage of tobacco. I am obviously targeting the plastic filters of cigarettes, it is cellulose acetate. An ambitious reduction target: minus 50% by 2025, minus 80% by 2030, and we finally confirm the responsibility of producers under the polluter pays principle. I conclude, Mr President, that citizens expect us to adopt the most ambitious legislation against single-use plastics on Wednesday. It is now, ladies and gentlemen, and it is up to us to make this choice for the environment, for the generations that follow us and also for those millions, those tens of millions of Europeans who are mobilised, who are watching us and who are ready to consume differently.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 174, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. ‚Äì Mr¬†President, I wish to thank the rapporteur, Ms¬†Ries, and all the shadow rapporteurs for proceeding with this report very quickly and with a lot of ambition. Urgency and ambition are indeed necessary because we are facing a huge environmental challenge. Plastic parts are found in sea turtles, seals, birds, whales and fish. They enter the food chain, harm the environment and pose a threat to human health. We have all heard the estimate that there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean by 2050. Every minute, the equivalent of one garbage truck filled with plastic is being dumped into the ocean. Due to the increase in consumption and production, this number is projected to rise substantially. Thankfully, although these quantities of plastic and their impact on the marine environment are shocking, just 10 single-use items, along with abandoned and lost fishing gear, represent a great majority of the source of the problem and that is about 70% in all.  That allowed the Commission, in the directive we tabled in May, to focus directly on the cause of the problem. In the plastics strategy, we made it clear that we do not demonise plastic ‚Äì it is an adaptable and useful material ‚Äì but we promised to table a proposal that would tackle marine litter effectively in response to mounting scientific evidence and mounting public outcry. The directive aims at banning certain single-use plastic products where alternatives are readily available and affordable, as is the case for cotton bud sticks, balloon sticks, cutlery, plates, straws and stirrers. Where there is no real alternative material to plastic, the directive‚Äôs goal is to significantly reduce the use. This will apply to cups and lids, food containers and very light carrier bags. The directive also proposes obligations for producers of tobacco product filters, drink bottles, crisp packets, wet wipes, drink cups and lids, food containers, balloons and very lightweight carrier bags to help cover the costs of waste management and clean-up. We propose a 90% separate collection rate for single-use plastic bottles by 2025. This will positively influence the quality of collected material, making recycling more profitable and making cheaper and better quality recycled plastic available for new products. Clear and standardised labelling will be required on sanitary towels, wet wipes and balloons, as they get into our seas and oceans because people do not know how to dispose of them or they are unaware of the negative impact of the products.  Fishing gear represents around 27% of all beach litter. Here, producers will be required to cover the costs of fishing-gear-related waste collection from port reception facilities, its transport and treatment. Some of the amendments tabled recently in this House could very significantly reduce the scope of the directive and jeopardise the achievement of its objective. This would not be to the benefit of our citizens. I hope that on Wednesday this Parliament will give a strong mandate to Ms¬†Ries which will include no further derogations.  As highlighted by President Juncker in his State of the Union speech ‚Äòcitizens have high expectations for this initiative and we, as European institutions, have to meet those expectations.‚Äô This is why I am looking forward to starting negotiations in order to ensure a first-reading agreement during the Austrian Presidency so that this legislation can make a real difference on the ground as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 175, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Bronis ROPƒñ", "mepid": "125214", "text": "  draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Agriculture. ‚Äì Mr President, mr President, I would like to ‚Äì (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, colleagues.

We must therefore set targets in the directive for reducing the pollution of microplastics in soil, and we need to take additional precautions to discount the use of biodegradable plastic. We must also ensure that the achievement of the objectives of the directive does not become a burden on our businesses, farmers and consumers.

We have heard how many hundreds of thousands of tonnes of waste are in the seas. We know how many hundreds of millions of euros of losses are missing from the economies, and that is why the ten or now twelve points that we have listed are just right. I strongly support that.

I will tell you one thing: it is very important that in this report we have cooperation with industry, with recyclers and with consumers. If the industry does not finally understand that it has to make contact with the recyclers, how to develop a product that can be taken apart afterwards, if this awareness does not take up slowly but surely, we will not achieve the recycling targets. If we write them down, that is not enough. We have to develop motivation, we have to get the middle class to do it. I am not at all concerned with discrediting plastic, not at all, quite the contrary! However, I would like what the producers put together to be eventually separated by other industries and then recycled.

Mr President, plastic is a valuable material, but we are so sloppy about it. Disposable plastic ends up massively in nature and the environment, outside it, along the street side, in the verges, in the ditches and rivers and finally in our seas, resulting in the well-known plastic soup. Indeed, if no action is taken, Commissioner, by 2050 there will be more plastic swimming in our seas than fish. So the rudder has to change. We must make full commitment to sustainable and responsible management of plastic throughout the value chain. We had already agreed on this last month, when we overwhelmingly approved my initiative report here. This week we have the opportunity to put the action to the floor and to approve this proposal. And for me, the following three points are essential: One, there will be a tailor-made approach. Not all products are shaved over the same comb. Two, the producers have to pay for the clean-up of plastic litter, including cigarette butts. Three single-use plastic drink bottles must contain 35% recycled plastic by 2025 and 90% must be collected separately. I understand that the focus is first on those products that are most commonly found on our European beaches, but for me an overall strategy for disposable products remains a necessary next step.

Our UK Environment Agency has published a life cycle assessment, which demonstrates that oxo-biodegradable plastic is superior to bio-plastic. This was reinforced by the Intertek report of 2012. The EU has instigated its own technical study but want to rush legislation through before the findings are published. This indicates that the European Union are trying very hard to airbrush oxo-biodegradable plastic out of the discussion entirely. Why? Because this is being developed by a British company, whilst the competitor technology is in the hands of the Italian company Novamont, who have received direct support from the Italian Government, who in turn have made it mandatory for retailers to use Novamont‚Äôs product.

With the second largest maritime area in the world, France is particularly hard hit. Recycling is necessary but insufficient, since the production of recycled plastic requires the introduction of new plastic, contributing to the permanent increase in waste. Similarly, some so-called \"biodegradable\" plastics do not disappear. Plastic breaks down into microparticles or endocrine disruptors that are found absolutely everywhere. Water, food, but also atmosphere, toys, floors, furniture, makeup, everything goes there. In short, dramatic consequences on health and especially in the early stages of life, where our hormones play as important a role as genes in physiological development. Here, the impacts can be irreversible for our children. The only solution is to limit these plastic products wherever substitutes exist and then ban them from being put on the market, and we must finally consider reducing consumption for others.

I would ask colleagues to support an amendment tabled by the PPE-DE, where we are making it a little clearer. According to the Commission's proposal, there are reduction targets for some products, but it is not clear how high they should be. In the worst-case scenario, a Member State could say: one or two per cent. And that is probably not the solution to the problem. That is why a minimum number must be in place. Everything about this is very welcome. However, I would also ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to support two amendments tabled by the PPE-DE which remove a product from the legal framework, namely balloons.

Global production of plastics has increased 20‚Äîfold since the 1960s and had reached 322¬†million tonnes worldwide by 2015. In the EU alone, around 26 million tonnes of plastic waste is generated every year and less than 30% of it is recycled.

This is enormous. If we want to have any chance of meeting our 2¬∞C target, we need to vastly reduce emissions from sectors and sources where emissions are so avoidable.

It is quite a radical proposal from the Commission to ban certain single-use plastics altogether from 2021. But it is a sensible line, because there are already more sustainable replacements for these objects, so they can easily be abandoned. It also accelerates product development, which allows us to get sustainable, better, more environmentally friendly products. I therefore support the Commission's proposal for a total ban on certain single-use plastics. In addition, it is important that we otherwise strive to reduce unnecessary plastic waste. Among other things, the proposal that all Member States should organise collection for plastic bottles is to be supported. In my own country, Finland, there has been a bottle deposit system that has been operating for decades, which allows more than 90% of plastic bottles to be returned and re-recycled and do not end up on beaches. We know that it takes up to 400 years for a plastic bottle to break up in the sea.  But one mistake has remained with the Commission's proposal, and that is that disposable mugs with low plastic content could also be banned on the basis of this directive.

The EU must act now to ensure these diverse actions do not fragment the single market. I would like to clarify the discussion on balloons. Actually the proposal will not ban balloons. It will ban balloon sticks, which are among the most-littered items found on beaches. There are alternatives available on the market, such as wood or cardboard. For balloons, the actions foreseen include information campaigns, voluntary action and labelling. As Mr¬†Florenz and Mr¬†Affronte mentioned, we are working with the industry. We understand that businesses need a level playing field, with clarity and legal certainty and the possibility to develop economics of scale for new markets and alternative materials. The aim is to create market and innovation opportunities for alternative products that are multi-use, but also products made from other materials with less environmental impact. It will boost new business models and offer innovation potential. Tackling marine litter does, therefore, create economic opportunities for Europe.

It completely ignores the issue of food hygiene, which is a great achievement in the use of SUP (single use plastics) compared to the past. It is also incomprehensible to apply different rules to SUP and plastic bottles, foil and plastic packaging, which are the main source of long-term environmental pollution. It is not true that the Commission and some MePs have said that the proposed proposal will be neutral for employment in the European Union and will only cover products from China.

Plastic waste is increasingly becoming a threat to ecosystems and biodiversity, to human health, to tourism, fisheries and shipping. However, the waste problem is cross-border, with 18 of the 20 largest marine polluters being emerging economies. Large-scale measures to filter waste from the world's oceans are costly and not yet effective, so ways can be found to prevent plastic from entering the seas in the first place.

Looking at the latest data on the growth of the European economy, you can be optimistic. They clearly indicate that we have taken the wind in our sails. Improvements are seen in areas such as public finances, employment and investment. The unemployment rate in the euro area was 8.6% at the beginning of 2018 and is the lowest since the economic crisis. The overall employment rate in the euro area, which stood at 71% last year, is also encouraging, showing that we are approaching the 75% employment target set by the Europe 2020 strategy.  Despite these positive signals, however, we must remember that there are still many areas that require us to intervene urgently and efficiently. The share of unemployed young people in the euro area remains close to 17% The rate of people at risk of poverty or social exclusion is also very high, which is currently just over 23% in the euro area, or almost 120 million people, which means that it is still higher than in 2009. Segmentation and inequalities in the labour market also persist. The above data means one thing: our efforts to combat these negative phenomena must be stepped up. Our aim should be an integrated labour market that provides high-level employment for all, including disadvantaged groups.  Therefore, reforms in the Member States should promote responsible labour contracts and adequate social protection, including for workers with non-standard and new types of contracts. Dynamically changing forms of employment, as well as digital transformation, require us to adapt accordingly. Workers who should be equipped with the right skills must also respond to the changing demands of the labour market. Therefore, our education systems should be better linked to the labour market, as well as lifelong learning should be promoted. We must also facilitate labour mobility and entry and return to the labour market. We also need a better work-life balance policy so that workers can adapt to employers' expectations without sacrificing their personal lives. To achieve this, flexible workplace arrangements, favourable parental leave for both parents, as well as investing in affordable and good quality childcare should be introduced. Efforts to combat poverty and social exclusion and unfair working conditions, which spoil the market and lead to poverty also among working people, are also needed. I believe that this year's Commission's country-specific recommendations are going in this direction, but I am concerned about their erratic implementation. Since the beginning of the European Semester, only 9% of all recommendations have been implemented in their entirety, while as many as 30% of the recommendations have been implemented in a very limited or not at all manner. In the meantime, I am convinced that better implementation of the recommendations to the Member States would in real terms lead to increased growth and employment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 221, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Romana TOMC", "mepid": "125104", "text": "   ‚Äì In many respects, the area of social and employment has been neglected for a long time, so I am pleased that, even by having a separate report, we are paying more attention to this area.

A well-designed social market economy is essential for Europe, and in particular for a good functioning monetary union. I would therefore like to thank the rapporteur, Mr¬†Hetman, for putting this aspect forward in the report we have discussed today. We share your analysis of recent socioeconomic developments. It is in line with our findings in the annual Employment and Social Developments in Europe review. The economic conditions are favourable. With 239¬†million people in employment, employment is at its highest level ever. Unemployment in the euro¬†area is now standing at 8.1%, the lowest since November¬†2008. We also share the opinion that there is still room for improvement. With the roadmap for deepening the EMU from December 2017 the Commission clearly set the objectives to address this. We stand for more jobs, growth, investment, social fairness and macroeconomic stability. We cannot have a robust economy without well-performing employment and social policies: both are two sides of the same coin, as we know. These policies are at the heart of the European Pillar of Social Rights and their development should lead to a stronger European Monetary Union (EMU). Hence, improving economic resilience requires us to invest in people, invest in the skills of workers throughout their working life. That is why we have launched and are implementing the New Skills Agenda. We live in a fast-moving economy that requires us to adapt. We have to be skilled and re‚Äîskilled on a continuous basis. Lifelong learning is not just a buzzword. It is a necessity.  To ensure that workers get protection and the relevant information about their job: that is what our proposal on transparent and predictable working conditions for all workers calls upon. To give everyone the possibility to combine their professional and personal lives: Our proposal on work-life balance calls for better working arrangements and compensated leave for parents and carers. As you know, these last two are legislative proposals still in negotiations between Parliament and the Council. We count on your support to reach an agreement soon. Legislation, however, is not the only instrument to have for stronger employment and social policies in the European Union and a more resilient EMU. The implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights by Member States is crucial to reaching this objective and the instrument to have to monitor and gauge progress is the European Semester.  When zooming in on the euro area, the Pillar is already fully integrated into the dedicated recommendation adopted in November last year. It asks Member States to focus on reforms that promote job creation, equal opportunities, accessibility to labour market, fair working conditions and support social protections. To conclude, let me stress that building a strong European economy and a resilient monetary union can only be sustainable through support and investment in our people. This requires well-functioning labour markets and social protection systems. In this light, we can only welcome and share the policy priorities indicated in your report.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 228, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  The debate is closed.

The economic situation and employment can currently be assessed positively in most euro area countries. Nevertheless, many challenges and inequalities remain in this area. These relate, for example, to the gender pay gap, the significantly different wages for equal work in individual Member States, or youth unemployment. This therefore requires concrete solutions which, in view of the reluctance to share their competences in the social sphere, remain in the hands of the representatives of the nation states. The relatively low unemployment rate we are witnessing today is so important, but it cannot be the final target that is wanted. There is a need to focus more on creating sustainable and quality jobs for an appropriate assessment or to ensure full application for many disadvantaged groups, including disabled fellow citizens. In particular, supranational companies operating in the European Union should also be encouraged to participate in bringing wage levels across Member States closer to speed.

Employee financial participation (EFP) is one possible way to achieve our goal to reduce unemployment and ensure sustainable growth and jobs. It has been proved that the social performance of a company that has employee share ownership is 52% higher than in companies which have neither employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) nor an employee saving plan. Currently, there are some 10 million employee shareholders in Europe and 20 Member States have some sort of EFP incentive regulation. Nevertheless, the development of EFP is geographically unbalanced within the European Union with a lag of 30 to 40¬†years between the lead and the late European countries. The explanation resides in the existence or not of adequate legislation and frameworks. In spite of many recommendations that have been issued since 1991, not much has been done in terms of approaching the topic at EU level through legislation or comprehensive public policies.  Therefore this report aims at creating momentum again for EFP by, first of all, emphasising the potential of these schemes for both workers and their employers. Among the advantages of EFP schemes, I can mention more sustainable governance, better business continuity and access to capital for SMEs, better social dialogue and quality of work, more fidelity and motivation, less absenteeism and better skills development.  Secondly, the report stresses the risks and the loopholes which need to be tackled while developing EFP. We must provide guarantees to protect employees and companies alike. Each EFP scheme should offer a wide range of tools for the company to design the most relevant scheme according to their size or activity. At the same time, any EFP scheme must be developed with social partners, employees and relevant stakeholders. It must remain voluntary for employees and should be based on their informed consent, fully aware of their entitlements, obligations and risks. Training should be offered to the employees in this respect. The EFP should never replace salaries and no discrimination should ever be accepted relating to the employee‚Äôs decision to join these schemes or not.  Thirdly, the report suggests a number of measures which could be taken at Union level. The Commission and Member States should design frameworks for the development of such schemes throughout Europe, they should promote financial education, raise awareness among companies and employees and look into developing fiscal incentives for companies which would like to expand transnationally. Synergies should be developed with programmes and for efforts carried out by the Commission whose aim is to improve access to capital, especially for SMEs.

I take note of your recommendations and of your commitment to the development and promotion of employee financial participation schemes in the European Union.  Research on the various forms of employee financial participation has pointed out the potential benefits, as well as the risks, associated with these schemes for both workers and companies. The studies carried out in previous years show how employee financial participation schemes can increase the competitiveness of companies. In particular, they can increase workers‚Äô income and their identification with the companies they are working at. As such, these schemes may improve the job satisfaction of employees and contribute to improving the relationship between the employer and the employees. At the same time, employee financial participation schemes can increase the financial vulnerability of individual workers. It is therefore crucial to prevent unreasonable risks when designing and running these schemes. Sufficient information should be provided to employees about the details of the schemes and any risks involved. Importantly, employee financial participation schemes should be seen as complementing their fixed wage. Employee financial participation may therefore be a subject of normal negotiations between social partners dealing with wage setting and working conditions without replacing them. Therefore I welcome the report‚Äôs calls for engagement with social partners on this subject. Progress on workers‚Äô financial participation will not only depend on supportive legal framework conditions in the Member States but also on the appetite of social partners to engage further in this area.  The Commission promotes participatory forms of corporate governance in different ways, for instance as part of the actions under the Small Business Initiative and by means of the Employment and Social Innovation Programme. As regards employee financial participation in particular, the Commission encourages Member States to exchange best practices in order to spread the information about how to design efficient schemes.  This concerns in particular the design of taxation regimes in Member States, which your report rightly identifies as one of the principal challenges financial participation faces. Financial participation, and more specifically employee share ownership, is also important to revive equity culture in Europe. Individuals having access to a securities account through their employers-employee share ownership scheme can familiarise themselves with capital markets and foster retail investments in the EU, once the core areas of capital markets union. That is why, in the 2017 mid-term review of the Capital Markets Union Action Plan, the Commission proposed to develop and promote best practices for employee share ownership schemes to provide an opportunity for individuals to get familiar with capital markets, giving a first insight into equity investment.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 239, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Rainer WIELAND", "mepid": "2323", "text": "  The debate is closed.

Unfortunately, it has also tried to revoke existing minority rights in order to preserve the amendment of the Administrative Law in the Constitutional Court. Klaus Johannis's mandate as President so far is not proof of the exemplaryness of the Romanian system for the protection of minorities, on the contrary: another pretext for refusing to talk about the real problems of national minorities.

In its economic forecasts published at the beginning of May, the European Commission mentioned estimates of the growth of Romania's economy in 2018 at 4.5%, and for 2019 it expects an advance of 3.9%. If we add to these performances the fact that the DƒÉncilƒÉ government places a major emphasis on social programmes, namely the absolutely necessary increase in pensions and salaries, I think we can conclude that Romania is on the right track and tends to occupy the seventh position among European states, becoming an important member of the European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 266, "date": "2018-10-22.json", "name": "Michela GIUFFRIDA", "mepid": "124864", "text": "   Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, a very violent storm struck eastern Sicily last Friday and particularly affected the province of Catania, with countries that were isolated from the flooding of four rivers, houses submerged in water, families evacuated and hundreds of millions of euros in damage, orange crops, artichokes and vegetables of all kinds completely destroyed.
