The Commission wanted to present its proposals first to Parliament and then to the press and not vice versa. Therefore, we first present them in front of you. Ladies and gentlemen, Madam President of the Council of Ministers, the Commission has just adopted this morning its proposals for the next multiannual financial framework. I will leave it to Commissioner Oettinger, who was the patient, inspired and tireless craftsman of this new budget architecture, to present it to you in detail, but I would like to highlight a few points. Any budget is important. The new budgetary framework is even more important than the one being implemented because it will determine the future of our Europe of 27 and, consequently, the future that we will leave for future generations. This is the debate we launched last year with the White Paper on the Future of Europe and a series of reflection papers, including on the future of the Union's finances. This is a debate in which this Parliament has fully participated, and I welcome our close cooperation on such a crucial subject. When we presented our white paper on March 1 last year, I told you that enormous challenges await us in a world that changes a little more every day at a dizzying speed. In Bratislava, and then in Rome, we chose 27 to master these developments, to seize them and to take advantage of the new opportunities, as they are promising. We have chosen a stable Europe, a more prosperous Europe, a more social Europe and a stronger Europe in the world. We have made the choice to move forward and to this choice must meet a modern, simplified and more flexible budget. In order to meet current and future challenges, the Union's policies and programmes must be provided with adequate budgetary resources. The level of the budget is not a neutral issue, it is directly linked to our ambition. The departure from the United Kingdom is a factor that must be taken into account. We have carried out a rigorous review of all policies and propose an ambitious but balanced budget that is just for all. Our proposal for a multiannual financial framework for the period 2021-2027 translates into an overall amount of EUR 1 279 billion. It is part of the European Development Fund, which until now has been an intergovernmental agreement and which, from now on, will be a Community agreement respecting the Community method. (Applause) By combining additional, limited but necessary contributions to finance new priorities and a number of targeted economies, the Commission proposes a financial framework equivalent to 1.1% of gross domestic product. That is a reasonable and responsible proposal. If we had not done this rigorous review of all policies, if we had simply responded to the many requests, if we had merely summed up the needs for new policies to the current unchanged policies, by maintaining discounts, other specific arrangements for certain Member States, if we had kept in the first place. The European Development Fund, if we had not taken into account the 15 billion resulting from the departure of the United Kingdom, we would have come to a proposal close to 2% of gross domestic product. This proposal would have been immediately rejected by all Member States and by a good part of you. We wanted to present a proposal that would be taken seriously and could provide a basis for future negotiations. Mr President, the budget we are proposing is a budget where every euro spent will bring a result higher than that of purely national expenditure, emphasizing the European added value of any expenditure. It is a budget which, in order to better respond to the challenges that will shape our future, establishes a virtuous intersection between existing modernised policies such as cohesion policy and common agricultural policy which remain important and new priorities, be it the protection of our borders, the digital economy, research, innovation or European defence. It is a budget that innovates in its structure so that our priorities become more visible and that innovates in simplifying its rules to create better synergies between the different programmes we propose to reduce from 58 to 37 with rules that will be easier to apply. It is a budget that innovates in the new flexibility it offers to enable us to implement our priorities and respond to unforeseen situations. It is a budget that also innovates with the establishment of budgetary instruments dedicated to our Economic and Monetary Union. Economic convergence and social convergence are central objectives of European cohesion policy, recently reinforced by our investment plan and which we propose to continue and consolidate further under the name Invest European Union. We are also presenting two new instruments that combine solidarity and responsibility. A reform support programme with a budget of €25 billion, including within Member States wishing to join the euro area and an investment stabilization function that can mobilise up to EUR 30 billion in order to maintain activity and employment in the event of major economic shocks. These two instruments go hand in hand. They reinforce the architecture of our Union, contribute to the resilience of our economies and societies and aim to prevent crises and better address them, where appropriate. We also propose strengthening the link between the European budget and respect for the rule of law. Respect for the rule of law is a prerequisite for sound financial management and effective implementation of the budget. That is why we are proposing a new mechanism to protect the budget from financial risks associated with widespread deficiencies in the rule of law. This mechanism is of general application, it does not target a priori individual Member States, but it is an important aspect of Europe's new fiscal architecture. Finally, Mr President, we are proposing a budget that innovates by giving equal importance both to the budgetary consequences of our policy choices and to the sources of funding the Community budget. One cannot act as if the problem of own resources does not arise. The Commission proposes, at a constant request from your Parliament, to introduce new own resources directly linked to European policies. Debates on our proposals are just beginning. They will take time and will be intense. Many of us, my dear Guy, in this Chamber, have witnessed these long budget nights of the European Council, so I know that the debates will be long, that we will need a lot of passion and determination. The conclusion before the European parliamentary election is in everyone's interest because, from day one, the continuity of our financing must be ensured. Our future cannot wait. Mr President, if I may, following the debate you had between you earlier, I would perhaps like to add a word on the exemption which the European Union enjoys with regard to tariffs on steel and aluminum, an exemption generously granted by the President of the United States. We have taken note of this decision, but I would like to reiterate here the appeal to make this exemption unconditional and permanent. We believe that United States measures cannot be justified on the basis of national security considerations. They do not have to be between allies and we therefore ask for their outright withdrawal. We will continue our negotiations with the United States, but we refuse to negotiate under threat.

In preparing this budget framework for seven years, we faced two fundamental problems: the gap that the UK's departure will create and new challenges that we should all see to solve in Europe, tasks that were not apparent in the dimension at the beginning of the current MFF: migration, Counter-terrorism, border control and management, defence research, defence industry, new social challenges. We tackle these two problems by saving, on the one hand, and by calling on the Member States to make slightly higher payments. Both — saving and investing a little more — seems right to us. Save: We have three groups of programs. The first ones remain the same, on the second we increase due to the new tasks, on the third we cut moderately. If you need to cut down, you can't get around the two biggest programs. This is why cohesion is around -7% and agrar around -5%, while direct payments are around -4%. And this is froze, so that an increase in the budget benefits year after year, while still allowing convergence to continue in favour of farmers in the new Member States. New tasks: We want to double Erasmus+ and — keyword Interrail — we want to finance this from this. I think that we are now inviting twice the number of young people to make Europe, the cultures, the languages that people get to know during their studies and training is an excellent offer. (Applause) Second: Research. In competition with Silicon Valley, Pentagon and its Chinese and Asian partners and competitors, we need to invest more in research and innovation. Some Member States do this themselves, but many are cutting in this area. We increase. Innovation, Research, Horizon, Europe and Digital — we want to increase our investment in Europe by 60% for the benefit of our competitiveness, for the benefit of our researchers. Third, security and defence. We see that there are reasons for flight and distress outside Europe that can lead to flight. That is why we will also develop our neighbourhood aid and our aid to the world by creating a separate chapter for this: Neighbourhood and the World, because we want to redesign our headings in general. The five headings we have are unreadable by the citizen: heading 1B, heading 3. From my previous task, I know that chapters in the budget must be readable — school, infrastructure, environment, social affairs, defence and internal security. We are increasing to seven headings, and in addition to the well-known topics, heading 1 Innovation and Digital, heading 4 Migration and Border Management, and heading 5 are new Security and Defense. And on the basis of PESCO and our defence programme, we now want not only to propose that the European Union invests EUR 500 million per year in defence research and then just a billion in defence industry, but we also want to increase the amount so that, at the end of this budgetary framework, together with can be allocated to our Member States two billion for defence industry, which is a multiple amount. Border Management: We need to know who is coming to us; we need to know the legal grounds. This has to do with the rule of law. But Bulgaria, Greece, Italy, Malta, Cyprus, perhaps Poland are very challenged or overwhelmed with this issue. It is in the interests of all Europe. We should create a basis for ensuring that internal border controls do not have to be continued in the long term — Austria/Germany, Hungary/Austria or Germany/Denmark. If we want to restore the free movement of people, goods and goods inside, the external borders must be controllable, our Member States need support, solidarity there. That is why — you will be amazed — we are proposing the expansion of Frontex in stages from 1 200 employees to 10 000 employees at the end of the MFF. I believe that this is a strong sign of European capacity for action, but also that Member States can then be asked to revive their internal border management measures piece by piece dismantle. We are reducing the number of programmes from 58 to 37 by bringing together to a little easier for citizens to explain which programmes are available to them. Single rule book, i.e. a common set of rules and simplification in general, are added in addition. We want to increase the LIFE programme and thus our climate and nature conservation activities by 50% and will thus make an effective contribution to ensuring that the Paris Agreement and the preservation of nature and the environment also receive a corresponding strengthened European offer, and with a percentage of 5.5% for climate change mainstreaming we are creating a complementary growing basis for this. My president mentioned the rule of law. It's about taxpayers' money. The point is that we must be sure that if there are disputes over European budget programmes, if there are ever litigation on the ground, then the independence of the courts — of third parties and the appeal of judges — must be without any danger, without any danger. And that is why a link between the rule of law and the refusal or allocation of funds from the European budget. It was important to them that new own funds are also available so that contributions from national budgets do not permanently exceed 70% or more of our total revenue. With various proposals before you, we want around 10% of our revenue to come from new own resources, some EUR 24 billion, including the proven emissions trading scheme, including corporation tax, but also completely new measures. We propose that an amount be transferred to the European budget along the resulting non-recyclable quantities of plastic. In this way, each Member State is free to decide how it intends to reduce the amount that it generates — through bids, prohibitions, national taxes. I believe that this is a very unbureaucratic and environmentally and future-oriented way. We believe that these new own resources will allow us to close the Brexit gap by 50% and will be able to fully fulfil the new challenges — migration, defence, security, Digital Europe — that the contribution from national budgets, if at all, does not really need to increase moderately. The integration of the European Development Fund strengthens the European Parliament's royal law. As a result, you will continue to be responsible for all programmes, tasks and expenditure on an equal footing with the Council. We come to the following result in the calculation — knowing what was written in your report, in the reports by your colleagues in Parliament: expectation: 1.3% of GNI. We know that we are between 1.0% and 1.03% in this MFF and we believe that, despite everything, realism is necessary. We can show you when it matters to the programmes: no programme is damaged, we are carrying out many new tasks, we are investing in the future of the European Union. Nevertheless, due to good economic development and a good growth forecast, we are coming to a GNI that will arrive at 1.114. 1.114, the development aid fund, which alone accounts for around 0.03%. In this way, the so-called net contributors should also be prepared to take this as a basis for deliberations, as a well-intentioned compromise proposal from the outset, this ambition — Parliament — on the one hand, and the willingness of the Member States to pay more. One final point: from the discussions of the last few days, I noticed that everything is being added together at national level: inflation, Brexit, new challenges, reduction of discounts and increased GDP. That's not possible. We do indeed have five elements responsible for the nominal increase of our annual budget. Inflation times seven, GDP growth times seven, Brexit is real, new challenges are in the interests of the Member States, but also real, and we are only abolishing the rebates in stages with a phasing-out that are reasonable for everyone. But it has to be clear: if you compare a 2014 budget with a 2027 budget — there are worlds in between! Increases in construction costs for roads, railways, environmental measures, gas pipelines, salaries for researchers and employees. This means that those who are anchored in national fiscal policy will compare 2018 to 2019 — 2%, 3% on top. Who like us for seven years in the Eye has compared, or even fourteen years, resulting in greater increases with seven times 1.8% inflation, seven times 2% gross value increase, etc. This automatically leads to nominally higher contributions, which are initially surprising, but are completely explainable and still meet the requirement of economy. One final point: from many discussions with farmers, mayors, regional governments, infrastructure ministers and farmers, I would like to ask that the sooner we advise, the more intensive, the sooner we decide, the better. The lesson from the current MFF must be: 15 December 2013 — adoption was far too late. If 2014 was a lost year — it was a lost year — 2021 should not be another lost year. That is why I would like to ask this Parliament to make the MFF your priority until Easter next year. And I would like to ask the President, who I greet and who is very constructive: make this a priority in the Council in spring, summer, autumn and winter. Then Europe can show that — the British are leaving — good governance under 27 is evidence of an effective European democracy, with very contradictory interests.

Today is an important day, it's about money, it's about the future of our continent. First of all, as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, it is important to point out that the money we have implemented so far for taxpayers was a good money, that the EU budget is a good budget. Prosperity on the continent is benefitting in research, at the EFSI, initiated by our President, Jean-Claude Juncker. Solidarity benefits — cohesion policy is the cornerstone of the whole of Europe. It benefits our farmers, our farmers, who are at a difficult level of globalisation, and those who stand by the side, and it will benefit the future of our young generation with Erasmus. The existing budget, the money we are investing through Europe, is well-invested money, and that is why we in the Group of the European People's Party want to defend it first of all. The cuts that are being proposed will now be discussed with those affected: with the farmers, with the mayors, with the representatives on the ground and also with the research community. We will discuss it and then we will also decide how to deal with it, and no one should question Parliament's determination. We will have a very difficult tool in our hands when it comes to the Fund regulations — the disbursement arrangements for the funds — and we will of course see it as a common package: the MFF debate and the fund regulations. The second thing I want to address is the necessary self-criticism expressed by the Commission. Bureaucracy, the question of mismanagement, corruption and OLAF investigations must also be taken into account, and of course the question: will the money be spent correctly today from the priorities? We believe that the current proposals are heading in the right direction. They ensure clarity in the budget — especially with regard to discounts, and on other issues — for clarity in budget planning — we support this. And some of the people who are already saying today that he now wants to cut the proposal even further further, wants to make further incisions: I would, however, be in favour of butter being made on the fish on the Council side now, which will then also be presented: Where will be cut then? The abstract debate that we have in part from the Member States that numbers are being discussed must come to an end. Anyone who wants Europe to continue to lose funds should now also tell who he wants to take them away. The third idea I want to make, ladies and gentlemen, is that Europe and the world are changing fundamentally. That is why the new priorities that are indicated are necessary and correct. I am pleased that security and border management are two separate blocks in this new budgetary structure, and we are thus confirming people that we are becoming concrete: drone technology, cyber war — all the issues are only possible if we work together against them — 10 000 front-excreators. A strong signal that we are putting it on research: my group decided a few days ago that we want to double the funds for cancer, because we, as a continent, should perhaps be the first continent that aims to really defeat cancer with the scientific expertise we have on this continent can. All great future projects for which it is worthwhile to argue. And youth: Erasmus and — it is permissible for me to mention this once again — the budget plans for Interrail are clear commitments that this European Commission is also serious for the young generation. Thank you for that! Last but not least, we in the Group of the European People's Party want to conclude before the European elections. We do not want a policy of dispute, but we want a policy of solution. Europe needs stability, and we have envisaged that there can be revision clauses, so that the next Parliament may also want to make changes if it deems it necessary. That is why it is clear with respect to the next legislature that we will close before 2019 can. It is a moderate but ambitious proposal: it preserves good, it strengthens new things.

Yes, we appreciate that. And we also appreciate what you give a time-frame which allows for substantial negotiations, with the intention to finalise within this mandate. Both are good. but now we have to check on the content? Do you yourself regard this as being the Commission of the last chance? I remember that very well. Is this really the concept and the proposal of the Commission of the last chance for the forthcoming decade? Are you really sure that this already is an answer to the challenges of today and tomorrow? Are you really sure that within your proposal we will find the vision for the young people of Europe for tomorrow? Have you really already incorporated the vision into this concept that we urgently need to inspire our young people — to get the people of Europe — back to Europe, to protect them and show them where we want to go? I have my doubts. Ladies and gentlemen, we in the Socialist Group have become accustomed to the fact that we only want to talk about economy when we talk about work, that we only want to talk about work when we talk about the environment, and that we only talk about the environment when we also talk about the social world. Yes, people with low incomes also need clean energy. Even people, where family income is small, do not want to live on arterial roads, where their children choke on the car exhaust fumes. We need holistic designs. In our joint work in the European Union, we have a starting point for this. We have the Lisbon Strategy, we have the Europe 2020 strategy. Why do we not take a bold step further and say overall as the Commission, as we say in our Socialist Group: our strategy will be the United Nations strategy to be guided by sustainability goals, holistic approaches and to ensure that the UN 2030 Sustainability goals will be our concrete policy for the next few years. That's what I'm missing, as well as the corresponding volume we need. Yes, approaches are there, they have the merit of talking about the new tasks, but compared to the proposal — ladies and gentlemen, including those of the Group of the European People's Party — this House, agreed with great agreement, is missing 220 billion, spread over seven years. It is about solidarity, it is about the fight against growing inequality, and that is why I miss an important revenue item here too: the question of why Internet giants should not actually pay taxes for the European budget. It won't be! This Europe will not be if workers are the only ones paying taxes directly, because this will be deducted from them from the pay strip if the small, medium-sized companies are the honest taxpayers, but we do not get the Big Digitals to pay. Help to change that, it's about the people who need our confidence and orientation. It is about the craftsman in Spain, about the student in Warsaw, it is about the young people all over our countries who are waiting to find good work in a good world.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 34, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Bernd KÖLMEL", "mepid": "124824", "text": " Mr President, Mr Oettinger. I am very grateful for the many issues that you have presented in the détail, and I have to say that they largely meet with my assessments when it comes to the priorities of future work, in the direction of our EU. I am very grateful to you for being courageous and for cutting this Parliament's proposals. You know, I would have wished you even more courage, because we need to cut even more. It can't be that it looks like we're talking abstractly about sums coming from somewhere! That is taxpayers' money, and it needs to be done first. This does not fall from the sky! Mr President Juncker, you rightly said and pointed out that you published a White Paper and it was announced that we would be discussing this White Paper in the EU. I wonder where this discussion took place! Not in Germany at least — at least not enough. We have not clarified: what are the future tasks of the EU now, what are we dealing with, what can we really do better at EU level than at Member State level? There's plenty we can do better. At the moment, however, we are also doing a lot of things that we cannot do better at EU level, including, for example, agricultural support. Yes, I will mention this area quite specifically, Mr Weber, because agricultural support is precisely the point where theory and practice differ. We say that we want to give the developing countries good chances to be able to trade fairly with the EU, while at the same time we are currently using agricultural policy to close off the EU markets. That's nonsensical! This is absolutely absurd that, on the one hand, we in Africa do not give farmers the opportunity to act fairly and spend enormous sums of money in Europe, which will go somewhere through redistribution, causing an enormous amount of bureaucracy. We should start there, and I think that would only be an essential point where we can make the EU better than it is now. That is why I believe that it is not good if we give the impression that if only the EU budget is large enough, then we will also have a good EU that can help anywhere. This won't work, we will disappoint people's expectations — it can't be any different.

I think for Jean—Claude Juncker, it is his fifth or sixth. Let us be honest: as I said a few times to Commissioner Oettinger, it will be business as usual in this MFF. It can still be business as usual because this proposal has to go to the Council and it is there that it is business as usual: trying to get the maximum amount of money from the budget without paying a lot into that budget. Personally, I think that this MFF is a break with the past. It’s not a revolution, but it’s a break with the past on four elements. The first is that we had two decades of MFFs and budgets being reduced and, for the first time, we are going up again. We went down to 1% and we are going up to 1.14%. It’s not a revolution, but it’s on the right track.  The second is the priorities. For the first time, I see serious cuts where they are necessary and new money where it is necessary: innovation, research, Erasmus. Border management will increase a lot, to a total of EUR 34 billion over the seven—year period. I see a third break with the past: finally, new own resources – a battle that started 10 years ago. The Council has refused to introduce them every time, but now we are going from 70% to 60% GNI contributions and own resources are going up. I think there have been good proposals on carbon taxation, plastics, corporate tax, and there is Mr Bullmann’s proposal that you can take with you. Lastly, I think the fourth break with the past is the conditionality in the budget – respect for the rule of law. We have to be very clear about this, Commissioner. It is also very simple, colleagues. If a government of a Member State of the European Union wants to apply and to respect European values, they do not need European money to do that. That’s the reality that we need to include in this budget. European money, in my opinion, should be used to lift up our national economies, to lift up our citizens and not be given or be granted to Mr Orban’s family or to finance one or more new football stadiums in his constituency. That is not a reason for spending the money.  Finally, I think that we are taking a huge step forward and my request to you is to help us to take the last step forward. That is in the power of Parliament. We always receive beautiful speeches here from the Heads of State and Government. Tomorrow we will have another one from my Prime Minister, and we will have another within a few weeks. They all talk about the virtue of European democracy, but in reality this is the only parliament worldwide which has no say about its income. We only have a say about expenditure. That has to change now. In my opinion, Mr Commissioner, there will be no green light from this Parliament for whatever deal you make with the Council if there is no principle agreement with the Council that gives full responsibility for expenditure and income to the Council and to Parliament. Mr Juncker, we count on your support because the Council will be stubborn on this issue – we know that. They think, ‘it is all money and we decide on it’. No, it is more and more money from companies and citizens, and it’s our own resources. Who represents the companies and the citizens? We, the European Parliament, represent them. I count on your full support to help us to obtain that responsibility and then to get the green light for this more ambitious MFF.

It’s decided by who is doing what, and when. And the budget of the EU – our budget – must show that there is a clear commitment to saving this planet. So I am happy to see that more money will be put into climate-related issues, but if we’re ending up at 25%, that’s certainly a step in the right direction, but it’s a very small step. We should actually be at 50% spending on climate-change-related issues. And what is true for climate change is certainly also true for the development goals. There also we all signed and we all proclaimed, and we all claimed to agree that we need to do something to remove the reasons for why people have to flee their homes. But that means working against poverty worldwide, and if we don’t spend at least 0.7% of our GNI on sustainable development, following very clear criteria, then we’re failing the global community. And we are also betraying our own pious Sunday speeches. What kind of future do we want to see for the European Union? That is where the money should go – to social policies, youth programmes, research, and also farming that is good for people and the planet. And all this money needs to be spent well. Too much is being diverted, misused, and even contributes right now to fraud and to corruption in Member States. EU citizens need to know that every euro spent has an added value and delivers results. I think this is one of the biggest tasks that this budget has to do – making sure that it helps the rule of law, without taking citizens hostage for their governments’ behaviour and without creating a rift between any geographical parts of Europe. The EU should rather support local groups and initiatives that promote European values directly, and if governments don’t comply with basic rule-of-law standards, then the money going to those Member States should be managed by the Commission itself so that it will benefit the communities and municipalities, but not some individuals, indeed, that are filling their pockets. All this money has to come from somewhere, and we are very happy that the Commission is proposing to establish new forms of own resources. We very much agree with your ideas for that: a common corporate tax base, emission trading system benefiting the EU budget, and a plastic tax. (Of course we would also have more ideas for that). And with that proposal, the EU would finally have more own income, independently of the whims of the Member States, and those revenue sources would be contributing to something good: fairer taxes, less plastic pollution and less climate change. We are very much ready to discuss your proposals. We will look into the details and we are ready to work together with you and finally, together, drag Europe into the century of the fruit bat.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 37, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Liadh NÍ RIADA", "mepid": "124987", "text": "  thar ceann an Ghrúpa GUE/NGL. – A Choimisinéir, cé go bhfuilim an-bhuartha faoin treo ina bhfuil buiséad an chéad seacht mbliana eile ag dul, cuirim fáilte roimh an mhéadú caiteachais ar thaighde, oideachas agus traenáil trí na cláracha Horizon agus Eramus +.

This proposal lacks realism. Once again, where, with elections, European citizens demand the return of many competences at national level, the Commission — despite the exit of the United Kingdom — imposes and calls for an increase the multiannual financial framework. The citizens will always pay, both through higher national taxes, or through what you call “own resources”, which is nothing but additional taxes; because multinationals will overturn, as happened for roaming, these costs on the end consumers. Another note, Mr Juncker: You and Commissioner Oettinger have said that certain points of this proposal are not intended to punish individuals or certain Member States. Well, to see these proposals specifically, it seems that the reduction of appropriations on cohesion policy and linking some Funds to compliance with the rule of law are aimed at punishing some Member State, especially in Eastern Europe, which in recent years has not aligned itself with the central vision of the Union. Punishing those who don't align, Mr. Juncker, is typical of dictatorships, and from those who believe the defender of the principles of democracy you expect much more. Another point is that of the “security and defence” item, which concerns a considerable marchetta to the new pro-European hero Macron. The last point concerns something that is very close to the public's heart: administrative expenses. In your proposal, administrative expenditure will increase by 15 billion euros.

I am thinking of the weakening of the budget for cohesion policy, the weakening of the budget for fishermen, the weakening of the budget for agriculture and this to finance new policies which are not obligations for the European Union: security policy, defence policy and fortress Europe.

We welcome the effort to clarify the budget, the emphasis on research and the elimination of discounts that must be disappeared — as a result of Brexit — but we challenge its spread over five years and the inadequacy of direct payments from the common agricultural policy and the Erasmus+ envelope, which would only be doubled instead of tripled as the asks Parliament. While the recent national elections give credit to candidates who criticise the functioning of the European Union, it is vital to recall that the budget must first and foremost meet the expectations of European citizens. In addition to actions to promote social and territorial cohesion, employment and training, youth employability, in particular, economic policy coordination, strengthening the governance of the euro area, there is an urgent need to assess the effectiveness of certain sovereignty prerogatives exercised at the national level and recognise the urgency of assuming them now at European level, be it defence and security, the fight against terrorism, the digital economy, cyberattacks, climate protection, fraud and tax havens. It is in these areas that it is easy to demonstrate what European added value could be. An exhilarating task awaits us. Parliament is ready. It intends to defend the positions it approved on 14 March and recalls that the post-2020 financial framework is inseparable from the institution of new own resources.

As for cohesion, you have a 7% cut here too. We have to consider well how to cut, here too, because there are areas of the eurozone — above all we talk about Southern Italy, the periphery — that still need this aid to get equal with the rest of Europe and we must not, here too, have linear cuts but to weigh well the cuts that you make.

There has been an attempt to reform the income side of the budget, which has been as fiercely criticised as it has been stable for many years.

I have not yet heard any complaints from farmers that they are swimming in the money and do not know where to put it.

Then, of course, you can ask here in this Chamber to renationalise this — and I have already heard that — only then it will not get cheaper.

You also included in this figure the Development Fund, which until now was out of budget, and you even included the new own resources - a very good proposal - but I think that these own resources could be used to cover new policies, without reducing those that are now and which proved effective. There are a few things I do not understand yet, but we need to see all the details, of course. I do not understand why, for example, transport policy must be at a lower level than six years ago and, at the same time, the Social Fund - I am in favour of the Social Fund - should be much higher than five years ago. All figures, all structural investment funds are low, lower than five years ago, which is again a question I hope to have answered.

By setting up an ambitious budget, Europe must therefore show that it is ready to act and that it is able to manage its future despite the loss of profits caused by the departure of the United Kingdom. In negotiations with the Council, we will ensure that efforts on research, innovation and digital transformation are maintained on the continent. The effort seems enormous, but that is much the least that Europe can do so as not to miss the technological revolution in progress. With regard to defence policy, the Commission's proposal gives real impetus and a vision for the future to the European Defence Fund, both for research and for the development of common capacities.

We have listened with great interest to your arguments, priorities and also your criticism, and the fact that, in addition to our President Jean-Claude Juncker, our two colleagues, Mr Crețu and Hogan were consistently present as the representatives of the two largest budget programmes, is also a clear sign of our respect for your priorities and our willingness to: to further develop our proposal. This is a first serve, not less, no more. The proposal that has been presented to you has received 28 votes in the Commission. It was decided unanimously by all the Commissioners. I do not believe that unanimity would ever be attainable in this House. We have a wide range from disappointingly low to tremendously high. But the same group, where it was said 'tremendously high', called for no cuts in cohesion, and certainly not on Agrar. We're doing everything we can. But please, let's always see the whole thing, each for himself, let's look at the whole picture. There are friends of the CAP, friends of cohesion, maybe we should also start friends of Horizon for Mr. Ehler, there are friends of Donald Trump. I am a friend of Europe, and I know one thing: if the British, with 65 million inhabitants, go as the second strongest European economy — the second largest so-called net contributor — this is a change, and you cannot pretend that everything remains as it is. More specifically, cohesion: of course, Mrs Crețu has fought for an increase. But we will invest nominally for regions, municipalities and infrastructure over the next seven years — nominally — as in the current MFF, just not a euro in the UK, but for 27. With low inflation in the EU-27, we will use the same amount as in the EU-28. I would not have believed that this would be achievable. Cohesion continues to be a priority of 30% of a modernised budget, which also has new tasks. Agrar: My request: Let's see the whole thing. I am very close to rural areas and agriculture, but I tell you that I always have to defend from the media, in public, with taxpayers, and many others that there is agricultural support at all. Let us not fall ourselves: 5% is a very reasonable amount of reduction, if you know that the second largest net contributor goes. You can't expect a wealthy uncle to leave or die, and the gifts under the Christmas tree will remain the same number and the same size. Let's always look at the whole thing and stay realistic. The subject of digital tax has been mentioned several times. To be clear, our proposal is on the Council's table. We are discussing G20, OECD. Only: lending money now is not yet ready for budget, and as Commissioner for the Budget, I attach great importance to clarity, truth and budgetary maturity. Because if I were to set ten billion, times 77 billion, or even an ascending 100 billion, and the whole thing bursts or was just as much a vision that threatens to become an illusion as the financial transaction tax, then we would have a problem. We need revenue proposals based on legislation or on probability. That is why I say to you, Mr Bullmann and other Members: the sooner progress can be made in the Council and Parliament in the next few weeks — and my colleague Moscovici is fighting for this — the sooner would be for the European finance ministers — Olaf Scholz and colleagues — to agree to this and then to allow the money to be included in the European cash register is coming. Sufficient time will then be given until the beginning of next year for a supplementary proposal from the Commission to support digital taxable revenue to this draft budget. You will have me on board from the first day that the budget probability and maturity is enough. This is not a rejection, no neutrality. We want this, but first the communication of this proposal, then the progress in the Council, and then the amount will be set on top of our MFF proposal presented today. Defence: We do not want to spend more on defense, we want to invest better and thus save. If 27 Member States invest individually — as we know — it will be much more expensive than if you invest in the Procurement, industry and research invests together. That is why the amounts we want to set are not a contribution to the arms industry, but a contribution to taxpayers and efficiency. Because we know that for a dollar the Americans get a multiple of what a Greek, a German, a Maltese, a Spaniard, a Frenchman, an Irishman gets with his defence investments. We're saving money. It is the opposite of austerity to set European standards efficiently, make European tenders, and thus achieve discounts and economies of scale that are possible with other countries — the US and others. Turkey aid is largely frozen. What you pay for is human dignity for refugees in Turkey — shelter, cold, heat, food, clothing, education. We now need to adopt a further tranche of three billion — hopefully these days — so that teachers teaching 300 000 children can get a new employment contract for September and a perspective for children and basic education in these refugee camps. That's why your post is not displayed in truth. It is not about palaces in Ankara, not about an airport in Istanbul, it is about the human dignity of 1.2 million people fleeing — from Iraq, Afghanistan or Syria. And that is why I believe this is a Christian view of humanity that must also be important to us outside Europe. (Heckling) And whoever says “nonsense” — all right. Only “nonsense” is not an argument. (Heckling) Give my regards to Donald Trump. I think your contribution was pure nonsense. (Applause) We have been questioned by Mr Lewandowski. It is expected to be 10 to 12% of revenues over the course of the period. But since some own funds will only come over time — 2023 — the percentage amount is lower than it met your expectation. That is, my numbers have minted above the average of seven years. I note that you were not happy with the advance deadline. I am grateful for this flexibility. What is it about? The Commission held its meeting this morning on a regular basis, as always on Wednesday, and we wanted to inform the press. But I can't inform the press at 6 p.m. That would not do justice to the importance of our common theme. Perhaps we — the Commission, Parliament — should vote even more closely on important issues in the future, when we will meet directly to you, when you are ready to attend meetings, and when the press will still be our partner in a press conference before the press release. We have made the best of this today thanks to the willingness of the President and my President to bring the sitting forward to 1 p.m. There should not be a scubbous of colleagues who could not be present. All the more so thank you for the level of presence on your part at an unusual time. The budget is not ambitious enough. Let me tell you this: I need and have unanimity in the Commission. I do not need unanimity here, I am on a majority in this House. But I need unanimity — unanimity in the Council to which I am going tonight. And I can tell you that in recent days I have been identified by elected mandate holders in Member States from which you come, by parties to which you belong. That is why let us agree: I will speak to my German Chancellor, Mr Bullmann, Mr Olaf Scholz, Mrs Grossetête with the Republicans, that they support Mr Macron with an ambitious proposal in the Council. And then we come back. Then we'll see what realism means. I am well aware that although some countries do not call for a reduction in the CAP, it is unwilling and willing to make additional payments. The squaring of the circle rarely succeeds in politics. We should do everything we can to convince the Council now that at least our proposal is 1.114. If it gets more, we'll carry it with us. Let's fight cuts together. We would also have the best arguments in favour of our proposal, at least and perhaps for further investment and the reduction of cuts. In this sense, I am very grateful that Parliament sees this as a priority and — in the case of of all criticism — a broad majority sees our draft as the basis for fruitful, intensive, constructive consultation. If I have to leave now, apologies to colleagues in the CONT Committee, but I have to go to the press conference now. My colleague, Mrs Crețu, is ready today — thank you — to represent the PIF report, and therefore OLAF here in Parliament.

At the moment, we have different instruments, which, among other things, can also be used to reduce child poverty in the Member States, but they are not harmonised and mostly money from the funds is still allocated to other areas, and money for investments in children is simply no longer available. Thus, of course, the new budget must provide for funding to combat child poverty. Secondly, in order to effectively support young people who are looking for a job and want to gain a foothold in the labour market, the European Youth Guarantee budget (funding) needs to be increased from 2020.

In particular, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to paragraph 174 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, according to which the objective of cohesion policy is to reduce differences in development between regions and to alleviate economically underdeveloped regions. I would ask the Commission, as guardian of the treaties, not to lose sight of the clear objectives laid down by the treaty. The fundamental task of cohesion policy must be retained and not redirected resources to the most developed regions by introducing indicators independent of the level of development of the regions. Cohesion aid cannot be linked to conditionalities outside this policy. Furthermore, cohesion policy cannot have a criminal character. The rule of law, the threat of deprivation of resources, would be the Commission's instrument of pressure against national governments that do not agree with it. I welcome the Commission's proposal to increase the pre-accession funds, although I still do not consider it sufficient. If we take into account the diversity of reforms and their resources, especially in the case of the two leading candidates, Serbia and Montenegro, these figures cannot be considered sufficient. I believe that this is not in line with the objectives and targets set in the EU enlargement strategy. I would ask the Member States to take this into account in the negotiations and to increase the resources available to the candidate States. thanks", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 84, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Tamás DEUTSCH", "mepid": "96826", "text": "in writing. - The European Commission has finally prepared its draft for EU funds after 2020.

Our firm position is that the sources of catch-up are not charity, but are based on the development of EU Member States to those countries, including Hungarian citizens. There was also a sharp struggle in the negotiations on the last framework budget, and it will not be any different now. The Government of Hungary and the Hungarian MEPs of the People's Party must fight for the Hungarian citizens, and we will fight for these rights, and we will find enough allies to gain access to the EU's development resources.

Although an improved proposal has been presented in relation to the original projections, as a member of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, I cannot be satisfied with the final proposal. Agriculture as an EU strategic policy should not have been affected by cuts. The EU agriculture sector today provides around 22 million permanent jobs, with food processing services and related retail securing around 44 million jobs together. Direct payments within the first pillar of the CAP support the revenues of around seven million EU farms. Nevertheless, the average income of farmers in the EU is lower than the average income in other economic sectors, making agriculture an unattractive interest. It is necessary to provide a sufficient budget for the Common Agricultural Policy, especially in the context of the increasing requirements placed before farmers in terms of environmental protection, climate targets and animal welfare. If we consider the benefits that farmers make for food production, biodiversity conservation, rural space survival, preservation of value and families, then it is clear that the CAP budget should not be reduced.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 95, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Alfred SANT", "mepid": "124781", "text": "  in writing. – There are contradictory factors within the Commission proposal for the Multiannual Financial Framework. Rightly, it features worries about the sizeable gap in EU budgetary resources that Brexit leaves behind. For this reason, the proposal diminishes crucial spending dedicated to cohesion, as well as agriculture. Nevertheless, proposals for new funding priorities appear. The Defence Fund features prominently here. Although defence is and should remain a national competence, this new fund could be soon eating from money other long established funding programmes. Moreover, bundling tax-based own resources in the form of a CCCTB within an agreement on the new MFF is dangerous. Many countries are clearly against an EU-level system in the field of corporate taxation. This proposal could lead either to conflict or stalemate. Concerning the criterion used when calculating the allocation of cohesion funds, unemployment, climate change and migration will now also be considered as relevant indicators.

The EIB is the largest public bank in the world by volume and plays an important role, such as that played by the CONT commission, in readily highlighting — often with harsh but constructive criticism — aspects necessary for the improvement of institutions. In 2016 alone, the reference year of this report, the total amount of EIB Group loans amounted to €83.8 billion, with the mobilization of total investments in the same year of 280 billion euros. I would like to start with investment for small and medium-sized enterprises. SMEs play a key role in the European economy, generating jobs and wealth and promoting innovation: they account for more than 90% of EU businesses and employ two-thirds of the working population. Support for access to finance for SMEs and medium-cap enterprises must therefore remain a key priority for the European Investment Bank and the EIB needs to do more to support European small businesses. As far as the EFSI is concerned, I would first like to stress in this case the importance of the additionality criteria, which must be duly documented — something not happened in the framework of EFSI 1.0. This Parliament has fought so much on additionality and is a fundamental criterion. I therefore emphasise the importance of transparency with regard to the EFSI indicator framework and therefore welcome the fact that the indicator framework will be made public by regulation within the framework of FEIS 2.0. We want to have parameters regarding social, the environment, the real and effective economic interest in approving investments under this type of instrument. However, it is worrying that only 20% of EFSI funding has supported projects to help mitigate climate change and adapt to them, while the EIB standard portfolio reached the threshold of 25%. They are investments that have to go in the direction of emissions abatement. A number of specific projects are also mentioned in the report. One point I dear is the EIB's financing of the transadriatic pipeline project, which does not respect environmental and social standards to a different extent in transit countries (Albania, Greece and Italy) Minimum Equator Principles. I would also recall that the Dieselgate scandal raised several questions about the obtaining of EIB loans by Volkswagen through fraudulent and deceptive means, and it is good that the EIB carry out OLAF's recommendations on the adoption of concrete measures in the implementation of its anti-fraud policy. On transparency and accountability, I am pleased that the minutes of the EIB Management Board have been published and in this regard I urge you to publish the minutes of the meetings of the management committee. Stricter conflict of interest rules and clear, rigorous and transparent criteria must be laid down in order to avoid any form of corruption. I also welcome the proposals of the EIB Ethics and Conformity Committee on Corporate Governance and Transparency, such as the introduction of ethical aspects in its field of competence. I also stress the importance of strengthening integrity obligations following termination of employment and providing concrete penalties for potential cases of “revolving doors” among higher-ups EIB managers and the private sector. I call on the EIB to quickly apply relevant EU legislation and rules on tax avoidance, tax havens and other related aspects as well as to demand from its customers compliance with these rules and to prevent the risks of corruption and infiltration of organized crime more effectively. I leave the floor to my colleagues to open the discussion and I am also ready for other considerations in the follow up that will be closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 104, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, first of all, I would like to stress that the Commission greatly values the important role that this House plays in scrutinising the activities of the European Union institutions, including the EU Bank. We therefore welcome Marco Valli’s report. The importance that Parliament attaches to monitoring the European Investment Bank mirrors the key role that the Bank plays in the financial implementation and delivery of our political priorities. The European Investment Bank is an indispensable partner in financing infrastructures and in supporting small- and medium-sized enterprises, innovation, employment, climate change, sustainable transport and policies related to external actions.  I would like to focus on the Commission’s actions in two fields of particular relevance highlighted in your report. First, on compliance: we cannot – and must not – allow taxpayers’ money to be channelled through complex structures with high tax avoidance or risk or through tax jurisdictions which do not comply with international tax good governance standards. The European Union has achieved unprecedented progress in its efforts to counter tax avoidance.  Let me give you a few examples. We have swiftly adopted all the elements of the anti-tax avoidance package, dramatically increased tax transparency and adopted the first ever EU list of non-cooperative jurisdictions for tax purposes. All these collective actions have put the European Union at the forefront of international efforts to improve tax good governance. At the same time, we have been taking steps to improve consistency between our tax policy objective and the delivery of EU funds through international financial institutions. As a result, a number of regulations governing the use of EU funds now contain clauses intended to ensure that EU-funded projects do not contribute to tax avoidance.  All EU partners entrusted with the implementation of the European Union budget will need to meet these requirements. In order to ensure effective application of the new legal rules, the Commission adopted a communication on 24 March providing guidance on the new legal requirements. We have also asked our implementing partners to reflect this guidance as quickly as possible in their policies. However, the impact of the guidance depends on the Union’s ability to send a unified message. For this to happen, it is important that Member States’ representatives in governing bodies of international financial institutions, development financial institutions, and national promotion banks, along with other institutions supporting projects through the use of public funds, adopt a consistent approach that reflects our joint commitment to countering tax avoidance. Parliament’s continued support in this endeavour is most important, not least in order to reach out to the Member States as shareholders of the EIB.  Secondly, on the transparency and the addition of the European Fund for Strategic Investments (EFSI), the first detailed reasoning for the decisions of the EFSI Investment Committee approving the use of the EU guarantee was recently published on the EIB website in line with the new requirements under the EFSI 2.0 Regulation. The first scoreboards related to those decisions have also been made publicly available. They give detailed information on the four-pillar assessment that each project has undergone before being submitted to the EFSI Investment Committee. This significantly increases the transparency in decision-making on EFSI support. Responding to the criticism in this House, I would say three things. Firstly, you have to bear in mind that EFSI was a revolution for the EIB in terms of expectations as regards the type of operation and risk. Secondly, today’s results are overwhelmingly positive, as all Member States are covered, smaller projects are being pooled through investment platforms and new instruments are being developed, including for the social sector. The top five users of the EFSI are currently Greece, Estonia, Bulgaria, Portugal and Spain.

We see this very concrete because a loan has been approved by the European Investment Bank for our Oosterweel plans of EUR 1 billion. This will enable us to do serious work.

Furthermore, it is regrettable that within the annual EIB portfolio social investments amount to less than 6%. The focus of the EU budget and new challenges such as migration, borders and defence underline the increased need for the EIB to promote investments in priorities set out in the Treaty, such as cohesion. Given that social cohesion is a key horizontal priority goal for the EIB, and while the bank is still struggling to achieve the mandatory 30% threshold, it is now evermore called upon to identify and include in its activities new forms of investments which are suitable and effective for the social sector and to implement them on a broader geographical scale, taking into consideration the need to implement the social pillar, as well as to counter inequalities, parities and disparities within the EU. Mr President, without adequate social investments, the very future of the European project will be severely jeopardised.  And by the way, Mr President, how come there is no representative of the Bank at this discussion? Is it possible that Parliament failed to invite any Bank representatives?

Because he suddenly wanted to be a bank like that, because he cares more about the AAA ranking, on those ratings, on those expert assessments, but he does not understand his special role, also in the context of the countries of the new Union, the countries of our region. I think the EIB has at the moment shut down to investment in modern technology, it has cut back very much on those investments, which are a little more risky, but without such investments there will be no economic progress in our Europe. At the moment, the EIB is racing against commercial banks — it is meaningless, it is not this league, it is not what he was called for, among other things with our — the European Union — participation.

The total financing has already been discussed: EUR 83.8 billion, and a total of EUR 280 billion has been mobilised. What is important is that a quarter of this was directly related to EFSI financing, which in turn is essential for closing the investment gap at European level, 1.1% GDP growth and creating 1.4 million additional jobs. In 2016, there were four policy areas in which the EIB invested: innovation and knowledge, SME and midcap financing, infrastructure, and the environment and climate change. Almost a third of the financing, or EUR 21.3 billion, went to small and medium-sized enterprises. A total of 385 000 SMEs have been financed by the EIB, which are also a priority, as SMEs play the crucial role and are the backbone of the European economy.

I would like to say a few examples. One for all. Perhaps I think that investment in transport construction and infrastructure could be used precisely thanks to the European Investment Bank and could be put and directed into projects that can have added value or which may have leverage for the economy of a given state. Also, investments in start-up, new technologies, we can implement all this through these loans, which can have added value precisely to the beneficiary on the basis that European investment the bank is able to structure those projects perfectly and can appreciate the risk from these projects.

I thank Mr Valli for his report, which is very interesting, although some local issues sometimes disdeserve. I will only raise two concerns. Firstly, with regard to the EIB, the dramatic lack of adaptation to microcredits, which are fundamental to development cooperation, must be denounced. In regions such as the Maghreb, or, in general, in Africa or Latin America, we find that there are many contracts signed but nothing implemented. Now that the EDF finally falls within the Community budget, it is more important than ever to ensure that this type of microcredit is represented. Secondly, its lack of adaptation to start-ups and the need to cover the risk necessary to move forward. That would be a great added value: that they do not have to go to the United States for funding. And finally, as Mr Hoyer is not here, maybe the commissioner can explain it to me. A curiosity: how have the European Investment Bank and its advisory hub of excellence — in any case as far as it costs us — have been integrated into the configuration of the new European Union financing instrument?

We will surely have the opportunity to continue the discussions on the EIB’s role as a strategic implementing partner in the forthcoming months in the context of the Commission’s proposal for the next multiannual financial framework. As I said in my opening debate, this strategic investment fund was a revolution for the EIB, and we have worked together also on the omnibus to make some blendings between structural funds and strategic investment funds in order to maximise the impact, and we are working very well with the EIB. Also, regarding the request of Mrs Ines Ayala, I would like to say that the EIB has adapted and changed its business model with EFSI, taking on more risk, developing new products and benefiting smaller projects. You know that small and medium-sized enterprises incentivising start-ups are the biggest beneficiary so far of EFSI. We expect more than 611 000 SMEs to benefit from the EFSI fund. For start-ups, we just launched the so-called ‘Venture EU’, which will target specifically start-ups to help them grow in Europe, and also we expect to attract EUR 55 billion with this new initiative to support over 150 000 start-ups and scale-ups. As I said, we are continuing to pay attention to the valuable observations and suggestions of the European Parliament. I would like to thank once again the rapporteur for this important work and of course, it’s a pity that the representative of the EIB is not here, but hopefully we will have the opportunity to speak again.

You know that many Venezuelans are also European citizens and you know how deep the ties are that link the country and the European Union. They are cultural, social and even family ties. Yet, the latest developments have pushed the possibility of a compromise even further away. Since we last discussed Venezuela in the plenary just a couple of months ago, the negotiations in Santo Domingo have been suspended indefinitely without an agreement between the Government and the opposition. In spite of this, the Government decided to go ahead with early presidential elections, to be held on 20 May. There was no agreement on the electoral calendar, and the current electoral process does not guarantee transparent and credible elections with the participation of all political parties in an equal manner and without obstacles. This non-inclusive decision will only exacerbate polarisation and tension and it will create more obstacles to a political solution. As these events unfolded, we reacted immediately over the bans and difficulties created to prevent the participation of opposition political parties and their leaders, including the exclusion of the opposition platform, Mesa de la Unidad Democrática. The National Electoral Council has also decided to prevent the participation in the regional elections of those parties that do not present candidates for the presidential election. This is a further blow to the credibility of the process. Back in February, as you know, we agreed with the European Union Member States’ Foreign Ministers that we would follow the electoral process in Venezuela very closely, together with our regional and international partners. On 19 April, we issued a declaration on behalf of the European Union calling for free, transparent and credible elections. We asked for an agreed electoral calendar and for guarantees in conformity with international standards. We will reassess the situation with Member States after the elections. We will consider the possibility of further appropriate measures to react to actions that would undermine democracy, the rule of law and human rights in the country.  In the meantime, I have been in close contact with several of our partners, first of all, inside Venezuela – I will come to that in a minute – but also in the region and in the international community, where we have coordinated positions and exchanged views on the best way to address this crisis. As regards our partners inside Venezuela, I met here in Brussels with both the Government of Venezuela and the opposition. Our goal has always been to support Venezuela and to help it hold inclusive and credible elections. On 11 April, I met the Foreign Minister and encouraged the Government to go back to the negotiating table and to show flexibility towards an agreement with all the opposition on the date and the electoral conditions. I also informed the Minister that the European Union could not accept the invitation from the Venezuelan authorities to monitor these elections because the current conditions of the electoral process do not allow a proper observation to take place. We have clear standards for monitoring and observing elections and obviously, in this case, these conditions are not in place. Last week I met with the President of the National Assembly and the representatives of the four main opposition parties. This was, first and foremost, to show our full support for the National Assembly. I also encouraged the opposition to continue working in a united manner towards a democratic and peaceful solution to the crisis. This is not only a political crisis: Venezuela is facing huge economic and social challenges. We hear this from so many Venezuelans. Inflation is expected to reach 13 000%. The population has to deal with shortages of food, medicines, water and electricity. Many Venezuelans have sought refuge in Colombia and Brazil, but also in Panama, in Chile and in the Caribbean. The European Union is stepping up its humanitarian support for the people of Venezuela, both inside and outside the country. The European Union will provide EUR 8 million in humanitarian assistance and we are mobilising other financial instruments in support of Venezuelan refugees and the host countries and communities. Against this background, it is time for all sides to engage seriously in working towards shared solutions. The Government has the responsibility to create the conditions for free and fair elections, based on a consensual calendar and with the participation of all political parties. We call for a revision of the electoral calendar, based on an agreed and credible timeline. As the European Union, we will continue to monitor any development, together with our partners, and we will calibrate future actions in the light of the development of the situation.  Let me conclude by saying explicitly that the European Union does not interfere in domestic politics. We never do. We do not impose solutions. We simply do everything we can to accompany and to help the Venezuelan parties and Venezuelan people to find their own solution, which the country and the citizens deserve to achieve. This crisis is not a natural disaster. This crisis is a man-made crisis.

None of them can be present in the elections on May 20, because some are in jail, others are in exile and others are disabled. If we are consistent, we cannot accept, we cannot recognize an electoral process in which those whom we have recognized with the Sakharov Prize cannot be present. In Venezuela, 90 per cent of democratic parties have been declared illegal. In Venezuela there are more than 600 political prisoners, not counting how many disappeared there are also. In Venezuela, over the past year, 6,300 people died from clashes with the authority. Just yesterday we learned that Daniel Queliz's mother killed in the 17th protests because he couldn't bear to live without his son. And that political crisis has already become a humanitarian crisis. In Venezuela he is starving again and dying from common diseases again. Caritas tells us that almost every day a baby dies in Venezuela. And the New York Times has made a very painful report on children who die from lack of food in this beloved country. It tells the case of Nerianyelis Torres, seven months old, who died precisely because his parents could not find powdered milk with which to feed it. We cannot accept elections in which there are political prisoners. We cannot accept elections in which all parties cannot take place on an equal footing. We cannot accept elections in which the electoral authority is not neutral — the president of the Venezuelan electoral authority is precisely sanctioned by the European Union. We cannot accept elections in which there is no neutral international observation, a decent international observation. That is why, as the European Parliament, we should demand Maduro to suspend the election call for May and call for other elections, with the participation of all political forces on an equal footing. We should say clearly that we cannot recognize the outcome of those elections on 20 May and that they follow the aftermath. We must also clarify that we are not going to send observers either the Commission or Parliament - and whoever will observe is going to be a personal guest of Maduro, and that we will continue to pursue the heritage of those who have become rich at the cost of impoverishing and making the Venezuelan people suffer. In Venezuela, the situation has reached such an extreme that it is already just a matter of being or with those who make them suffer or with those who suffer.

On Thursday last week, a representation of the Venezuelan Parliament came to visit the various political groups: eight representatives of the Venezuelan opposition, two of them presidents of the Assembly — one who was and one who is — from four very important political parties representing approximately 80% of the vote that was produced in the month of December 2015. They expressly asked us for a statement from the European Parliament calling for the suspension of the elections. I know it's testimonial, but they insisted on us to make that request, and that is why we urgently summoned you. I thank you for your presence, Mrs. Mogherini. Why did they ask us for the postponement? Because, as has been said, the electoral call is advantageous; it is not the same, because there are illegal political parties, because there are political leaders who are disabled, because the electoral system is not fair, because there was no agreement between the opposition and the government. That is why the problem we have now, ladies and gentlemen, is that we can continue to reiterate our condemnation of the Maduro regime, but I would like to express to you with a little balance that solidarity with the request for suspension which I share. We have to ask that elections be postpened, because they are going to create a larger gap, a more serious turning point of even internal rupture. But I would also like to say on behalf of the S&D Group that we call on the Government and the opposition to resume dialogue if they postpone the elections; that it is possible to find a framework of agreement again for a clean electoral call and that, at the same time, they are able to find a compromise to get Venezuelans out of the crisis humanitarian aid in which they live; to commit themselves to socio - economic solution.

The legitimate National Assembly and subsequently the Supreme Court having been neutered, 20 May is merely a coronation in a race devoid of any legitimate opposition. The collapse of the Santo Domingo talks made clear Maduro’s intentions to avoid any real challenge to his power now, as was also demonstrated by the banning of virtually all opposition parties from these elections. I welcome the targeted EU sanctions brought in by the Council against some Venezuelan officials. However, these remain limited, and we must now look to widen their scope. As the energy sector, which accounts for around 90% of Venezuela’s exports, begins to shrink, we see food shortages continuing and domestic dissatisfaction growing. Reports that the Government is looking to open up commercial opportunities for the military are also a worrying sign for the future, suggesting that Maduro intends to follow what was in the past an all too common Latin American authoritarian tactic for holding on to power via the army.

And as a Spaniard I am, I am also Venezuelan, and I feel it in my heart and I feel it in my soul.

That Venezuela lacks everything today is a scandal in a rich country, it's something like Qatar was in misery.

There are no conditions for free and democratic elections when very important sectors of society and imminent personalities are not in a position to present themselves to those same elections. There is no possibility of free and democratic elections when there is a set of procedural rules that are not guaranteed at all, as is the case today in Venezuela.

Venezuela is not just going through a very serious political crisis. It is also going through a serious economic and social crisis and a profound humanitarian crisis. We think that the only possible solution is dialogue, there is no other. We continue to invest in dialogue between the various political forces with expression in Venezuela, both those currently in power and those in opposition. That is why we call on the current Venezuelan regime to understand that insisting on these elections not only does not contribute to solving the problem of Venezuela but will sharply sharpen the problem.

One is the sincere feeling of friendship and support for the country and the people of Venezuela. I think that unites us and that is behind all our efforts to support and accompany the country out of a crisis that has different aspects. The second thing that I believe unites us as our common aim, goal and objective is guaranteeing that Venezuelan citizens have the opportunity, the right and even the duty to express through a democratic, transparent process their political will and determine themselves the future of their country. We are all hoping for a peaceful, constitutional outcome through dialogue, bringing the regime and the opposition together in a credible way and ensuring that democracy, the rule of law and human rights are guaranteed. This is the objective that we share. We will continue to use all our instruments and means to try to accompany the country in this way, but it’s a difficult way, however, I can guarantee you that the channels for dialogue from our side are always open. I think it is the right thing to do at the moment, and I’m glad to have the support of the European Union Member States in our dialogue not only with the Government in Caracas but also with the opposition and with the National Assembly, the legitimate institution of the country. That needs to be recognised. I was glad to meet the President myself, together with the opposition parties, last week. We met here, in this Parliament, by the way. We will continue to coordinate positions with our regional and international partners, from Latin American and Caribbean partners to the United Nations, to the Holy See and others that can help to bring the different parties inside Venezuela back to the negotiating table. We will continue to support and even step up our assistance to a population that needs it. For their generosity in welcoming and supporting Venezuelan people who are crossing the borders at the moment, the neighbouring countries and communities also need to be supported. I mentioned in my opening remarks that we called for a revision of the electoral calendar, but I want to be clear here. For us, a revision of the electoral calendar would also mean the elections being held in different conditions. It’s not just a matter of dates; it’s a matter of how an electoral process is prepared and, for the European Union, it would involve an electoral observation mission. You know that very well because you have lead them across the world. It’s never a matter of one day, the day of the election; it’s about the preparation of the electoral campaign, the participation in elections, the transparency, the open access opportunities for all, the day of the elections and the follow—up of the electoral results. In order to serve the democratic aspirations of the peoples all over the world, all of these processes are subject to some international standards that have recognised criteria and that we, the European Union, follow inside our borders and promote outside of our borders. Again, as most of you have said, we are making no attempt – and even have no desire – to interfere in the domestic politics of a third country. We have enough to worry about in our own domestic politics in the European Union, particularly you, elected Members of the European Parliament. What we care about is that the processes of the democracy in the world are solid, credible and transparent. This is the only purpose we have in our partnership with our Venezuelan friends. As many of you mentioned, there is a strong feeling of friendship between Europeans and Venezuelans. There are close ties, we know each other very well. I myself come from a country, as one of my compatriots has mentioned, that has many Venezuelans – Italy. The situation is the same for Spanish and Portuguese colleagues. We know what we are talking about. There is no antagonism, there is no polarisation, there is a true sense of friendship and communality of purpose here, and it is in this spirit that the European Union offers all its support for a truly democratic, transparent, credible process in Venezuela that I hope can take place inside the country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 144, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Lívia JÁRÓKA", "mepid": "28141", "text": "Motions for resolutions to be tabled under Rule 123 (2) of the Rules of Procedure will be published later.

The proper management of public expenditure and the protection of the Union's financial interests must be our priority. For 2016, the results achieved in terms of protecting financial interests and combating fraud are generally positive. The adoption of the directive on the protection of financial interests and the forthcoming creation of a European Public Prosecutor's Office are two successes which deserve to be highlighted. These advances will enable us to better protect the money and interests of European taxpayers and facilitate the recovery of fraudulently used Union funds. I regret, however, that all Member States did not wish to participate in the establishment of this European Public Prosecutor's Office (20 out of 28 Member States). In terms of the results itself, I would like to welcome the 15% reduction in fraudulent and non-fraudulent irregularities and the decrease in their value by 8% compared to 2015. Unfortunately, I am deeply concerned about the still very large number of irregularities in the areas of rural development, cohesion policy and fisheries. I sincerely hope that the simplification of administrative rules announced will reduce the number of non-fraudulent irregularities, detect fraudulent cases and improve beneficiaries' access to Union funds. Secondly, I would like to return to some specific aspects of my report. Firstly, I consider that the undervaluation of customs duties on Chinese products is the major political issue of this report. As you know, between 2013 and 2016, Chinese imports of clothing and footwear destined for the black market were dumped upon entry into the United Kingdom. Pants were declared with a ridiculous value of 91 euro cents per kilo, instead of 26 euros per kilo usually. On 8 March 2018, the European Commission opened infringement proceedings against the United Kingdom in order to recover the €2 billion that would normally have benefited from the EU budget. Commissioner, I would like to welcome the launch of this procedure. In my view, the recovery of this shortfall must be addressed in the context of the Brexit budget negotiations. The Socialist and Democratic Group will pay particular attention to this. Secondly, I call on the European Commission to forward as soon as possible a legislative proposal on the protection of whistleblowers, as requested by the European Parliament's report of 24 October 2017 on this crucial issue. I also encourage the European Commission and the Member States to adopt measures to protect the confidentiality of sources of information in order to prevent any discriminatory action or threat against whistleblowers. Thirdly and recently, I would like to return more fully to our fight against the illicit trade in tobacco products. As chairman of the working group against tobacco industry interference in the European Parliament, I would like to recall that 12% of the 6 trillion cigarettes marketed every year in the world are illicit traded. The consequences are of course health, and as Vice-Chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Health and Food Safety, I would like to point out that counterfeit or smuggling cigarettes are cheaper, more easily accessible for young people and more dangerous. The eradication of the illicit tobacco trade would lead to a 2% reduction in consumption. Faced with this challenge of combating this illicit trade, we must implement a comprehensive strategy to effectively combat this illicit tobacco trade. These are, Commissioner, the various observations or observations I wanted to make to you in my opening remarks on this report on the protection of the Union's financial interests for 2016.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 147, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Corina CREȚU", "mepid": "33997", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, you know very well that the fight against corruption and fraud is higher on the agenda for the Commission than it is for Parliament. Several hours ago, the Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, and the Commissioner for the budget presented the Commission proposal on the post-2020 multi-annual framework. The EU budget is, of course, a means to achieve our joint political goals and to have the resources needed to turn political priorities into tangible results for Europe and for European citizens in order to have a truly positive impact on their lives. To make that happen, however, we must fight fraud and corruption. The financial interests of the Union should be protected through effective measures both on the expenditure and on the revenue side. This includes prevention, detection and investigation of fraud, the recovery of funds and the imposition of penalties. I therefore thank the rapporteur for the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mr Pargneaux, for the good work done on Parliament’s annual report on the protection of financial interests and in particular for taking a holistic approach to the fight against fraud. The result of your work is a comprehensive report, and there is indeed a continuing need for such a holistic and comprehensive approach to combating fraud affecting the EU’s financial interests in all budget areas.  Take the example of regional policy, for which I am responsible. The Union’s main policy to reduce disparities among regions and Member States is a major driver of job creation, sustainable growth and innovation in Europe. According to the Commission’s 2016 report on the protection of the EU’s financial interests, 45% of reported irregularities concerned the area of cohesion policy and fisheries, 2.10% being related to fraud. That is why OLAF has included the protection of cohesion expenditure among its investigation policy priorities and has recommended the recovery of hundreds of millions of euros spent fraudulently in this area.  Only an effective and also a trustworthy and comprehensive system, including, as I have said, prevention, detection, investigations, penalties and recovery, will persuade Member States to support a strong cohesion policy in the future MFF.  Over the last six or seven years, we have progressed significantly in the anti- fraud area at Member State level. The Commission has developed new and innovative concepts. The basis of the Commission anti-fraud strategy and the idea behind the national anti-fraud strategies is that the Commission helps Member States to develop. The Commission fosters the sharing of knowledge and best practice and enables a network to be created among competent authorities of the Member States. We finance dedicated programme projects and put anti-fraud tools guidance at the disposal of Member States. These initiatives have boosted cooperation with and among Member States, but, again, we will do more.  That is why the Commission is currently in the process of reviewing its anti- fraud strategy in the context of the new multi-annual financial framework, taking into account recent changes in the fraud landscape. This new Commission anti-fraud strategy, an update of the strategy dating from 2011, will respond to the major risks affecting new financial interests, for example organised crime. The new strategy might inccorporate oversight of the anti-fraud measures in Commission departments and agencies and strengthen the role of analyses. Let me now turn to the legislative domain. Over the past few years we have together reinforced the legal framework for protection of the Union’s financial interests, achieving significant results. 2017 was a year of great achievement in that respect, with the adoption of two major legislative acts: the regulation establishing the European Public Prosecutor’s Office and the directive on the fight against fraud to the Union’s financial interests by means of criminal law.  Continuing in the same vein, the Commission will later this month adopt a proposal to amend the OLAF Regulation (Regulation (EU, Euratom No 883/2013) to ensure close cooperation with the EPPO and the effectiveness of OLAF’s investigations. The creation of the EPPO is a fundamental advance in the EU approach to fraud affecting its budget. Once European Prosecutor investigation has been set up, we will have two EU bodies with distinct but complementary mandates to investigate in this area. European Prosecutor investigation will increase the effectiveness of the criminal law response to fraud, and it will be in line with European criminal prosecution policy proper, whereas OLAF will complement the Prosecutor’s activities through its administrative investigations. The Commission is currently taking the necessary steps to set up the European Prosecutor’s Office. Our aim is to ensure that it will start operations in late 2020, thus contributing to successful implementation of the new multi-annual financial framework. In order to ensure that all available means are used to counter fraud and other illegal activities affecting the EU budget, the European Prosecutor and OLAF will work in close partnership and be mutually reinforcing, each acting within its own mandate. This is one of the main drivers of the proposal to amend Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 883/2013. The Commission wants OLAF to remain strong and fully functioning so as to complement the European Prosecutor’s criminal law approach with administrative investigation. OLAF’s role will remain essential in several respects. Firstly, OLAF will keep its mandate in all Member States in the area of non-fraudulent irregularities concerning the Union’s financial interests. The EPPO will have no competence for these purely administrative irregularities. Let me give you concrete numbers from the reports that we have been discussing today, which show the impact that non-fraudulent irregularities have on the Union’s financial interests. In 2016, for instance, a total of 19 080 fraudulent and non-fraudulent irregularities were reported to the Commission, involving a total of approximately EUR 2.97  billion. Out of that figure, 17 700 irregularities were reported as non-fraudulent, with  a financial impact of approximately EUR 2.5 billion. This means that 93% of all irregularities reported in 2016 were not of a criminal nature and thus do not fall within the mandate of the European Prosecutor. Secondly, OLAF will continue its investigations on the same basis as now in Member States not participating in the European Prosecutor’s Office. In those Member States, the national authorities, as well as OLAF, should create the conditions to ensure an effective and equivalent level of protection of the Union’s financial interests throughout the EU. Thirdly, in the Member States participating in the European Prosecutor’s Office, OLAF’s operations will be adjusted. Today, when OLAF encounters possible criminal offences, it can only address a recommendation to national judicial authorities, but with no guarantees as to whether a criminal investigation will be opened. In the future, OLAF will report such suspected offences to the European Prosecutor’s Office and collaborate with it in its investigations in order to complement EPPO operations to the greatest possible degree. OLAF investigations in participating Member States will lay particular emphasis on facilitating recovery and preventing further harm to the new financial legislative measures, thus supplementing the EPPO’s criminal law approach. In coordination with the EPPO, it may need to carry out action to complement an EPPO investigation, for instance in cases where there is a risk related to time or where the amounts at rsik are very high. OLAF must therefore become a close and a dependable partner for the EPPO in the Member States participating in the enhanced cooperation. carry on its work concerning irregularities of a non-criminal nature in all Member States and continue to fulfil its mandate as it does today in non-participating Member States. We will need the strong support of the European Parliament and the European Council to ensure that by the time the EPPO becomes operational, the OLAF Regulation is amended in order to allow full cooperation and the smoothest coexistence with the EPPO. As I have said, we must keep on stimulating, encouraging and also – when necessary – criticising the Commission and the Member States in our efforts, when dealing with fraud and irregularities, to protect Europeans’ financial interests effectively.

There is no doubt that the responsibility of the EU and national institutions is primarily to take care of taxpayers' money. According to the Commission's 2016 report, the amount of irregularities reported as malfeasance reaches EUR 391 million per year. However, it should be noted that in 2015 this amount was much higher at EUR 640 million. Concern, however, is raised by a rise in VAT fraud. Effective protection of the financial interests of the Union will certainly be provided by the Anti-Fraud Directive in the European Union by Criminal Law (PIF Directive) and the EPPO Regulation, as they grant law enforcement agencies resources that they have not hitherto in the fight against corruption. In turn, the introduction of whistleblower institutions and the call on the Commission and the Member States to give them proper protection should also contribute to a more effective fight against embezzlement of EU funds. The publication by the Commission of annual anti-corruption reports will also allow better monitoring of the situation in the Community. However, in order to avoid transnational fraud, it is necessary to establish closer cooperation between Member States in the area of Eurofisc, OLAF and Eurojust.

However, it cannot be hidden that the level of fraud on Union funds still remains high and so too are cases of corruption. In this scenario, the PIF Directive and the establishment of the European Prosecutor's Office represent fundamental instruments in combating offences to the detriment of the Union's financial interests and consequently also in contrast to organised crime and terrorism, which often fund themselves through such offences. While waiting for their final entry into force, however, we must continue to strengthen the coordination capacities between the national control structures and ensure that the new OLAF Regulation gives Clear and precise answers on the new system of anti-fraud at administrative level and future relations with the new criminal dimension introduced by the European Prosecutor's Office. In this regard, it cannot fail to underline that the enhanced cooperation with which the European Prosecutor's Office has been set up poses significant challenges on the correct repairs of competences between the criminal dimension and administrative, particularly with respect to non-member countries. The delicate objective that we must also pursue through the European Prosecutor's Office is to improve the system of recovery of illicitly defrauded funds so that this money is returned to the budget of the Union and can be used for the needs of our citizens and I think above all for job creation and for increasing investment by companies. Finally, in this debate, too, it should be stressed that the role that whistleblowers can play should not be underestimated in the fight against fraud.

There have been a lot of numbers. Here, I can tell you that in the framework of cohesion policy, for three years since I have been Commissioner, we have seen decreases, but indeed we have greatly increased the number of projects that we are trying to verify. But for the first time, the error rate was below 5%, of which only 0.5% means fraud. So in the rest there are irregularities, which represent public procurement, and I believe that this new multiannual financial framework presented by President Juncker and the Commissioner for the Budget today will also bring about an improvement, a strengthening of the protection of financial interests, which is already very top on the agenda of the European Commission. Because for us what matters is the final result of spending European taxpayers' money. I am convinced and I know that the Commission is not alone in this battle, and we count on the support of the European Parliament to continue this fight. I am convinced that on 29 May, when the Commission presents the new sectoral rules, we will come up with more transparency, which has been called for here, a simplification of the rules and, already in the Omnibus procedure, we have introduced some issues relating to transparency and the fight against corruption, the need to have machines that we can rely on in the States, because it has unfortunately been proven that 70% of irregularities could have been detected at national level and have not been reported. So, from this point of view, I would like to respond to Mrs Grappini and to those who have raised this subject before on the report: you know very well that the integrity and the fight against corruption are revealed in the European Semester for each country; and Mr Marias: I invite you to address the European Commission, to address the Commissioner for Budget, Mr Günther Oettinger, I also call on you to address OLAF with exact data because, as the President of hearing, I think what you have signaled, would be very serious, if that were true. So thank you very much and, as I said, you can count on the European Commission to encourage us, stimulate us, give us ideas on how we could better protect the European interest and money of citizens and their impact on the ground. Thank you very much, because I think that's what the trust and the connection between Europeans and what we do. Perhaps we are not saying enough and I think it is a mistake to concentrate, there are indeed many irregularities, but on the other hand, on the whole, if we see what cohesion policy has done, agriculture policy and how much they have contributed to the growth of gross domestic product, I am convinced that we must we see the big picture, and not everything in black. As regards the fight against corruption, we are doing everything we can and working with the Member States, with OLAF, now, more recently, with the European Public Prosecutor's Office, so we have every confidence that we can detect any irregularities in time to protect the European money.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 166, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Evelyne GEBHARDT", "mepid": "1913", "text": " Thank you, Commissioner.

Corruption targeting our community resources has emerged from the sphere of criminality and appears as a systemic fraud organised at least in one Member State — from government level, with the help of key players in the local judiciary. This is one of the most urgent legal and now serious political challenges for the EU institutions and Member States today. This challenge currently manifests itself in the most obvious form in the corruption network built by the Hungarian Orbán Government, which ensures the maintenance of the regime by almost complete expropriation of EU funds and public procurement. The recognition of the problem, although delayed, is evidenced by OLAF reports, a series of infringement procedures, and more recently by the proposal of Article 7 procedure, but the current instruments of EU law have failed to prevent both political and personal governmental corruption.

I would also like to thank the coordinator, Mr Nistelrooy, for also devoting some of his efforts to completing this report in time. When the European Union starts building roads that save potentially hundreds of casualties, when the European Union starts connecting villages, towns and families with its motorways, when the Union, thanks to the roads and railways it builds, starts saving tens of hours on travelers, then we begin to speak in a language understandable to people. Then the European Union is not a distant, imaginary being to people, but starts to be something they understand and believe in and feel empathetic. The title of my report is quite long and complicated, although the aim behind it is very simple: to show that in the last ten years, the European Union has never achieved more in investment in transport infrastructure. Moreover, I am pleased that this report comes so on time, just two hours after the draft of the next Multiannual Financial Framework was presented. We had a very simple goal. Firstly, to assess how useful and effective the investments were in 2007-2013, see at half-time how we are doing in the current programming period and make recommendations for the next one. I think we did well. However, it is obvious that we have a place to improve the way in which the Union operates. Last but not least, each of you, I am sure, knows that to complete the Ten-T network in the European Union, we need half a trillion euros. I am not sure that we are close to finding these funds, but we are obliged to say: if we succeed in doing so, and we are obliged to, the European Union will provide almost 10 million new jobs and will provide an additional 2% on an annual basis to the economic growth of The union. This is not about neglect. Moreover, if we have to put aside the kilometres, ports, motorways, railways, we have one main objective when we talk about transport in the Union, and that is that Eastern and Western Europe, Northern and Southern Europe remain only geographical concepts. So good to have connected the regions between them that we can overcome distances within hours that we can really say: we have free movement of people, goods and capital without having to wait at the borders or having to, despite the beautifully constructed roads, some country say: for me it is not a priority, and having to have so-called “Botonex”. It's not permissible. I believe that it is quite possible to take a step forward, and I am sure that in the framework of this debate we will all unite around the view that the grant from the European Union's cohesion policy has no alternative, especially when we talk about transport, especially in regions that do not can afford to attract private investment for this purpose.

As you rightly underlined, there are many success stories brought by EU transport investments over the last decade. You mentioned the completion of the motorway linking Sofia to the Black Sea, but this section of the Orient/East-Med corridor is indeed very strategic. Coupled with ongoing works along the Rhine-Danube corridor, it has contributed to improving the connectivity between the Western Balkans/Greece and Central Europe. I also have in mind the significant improvements, for instance, brought to the high-speed rail network in Spain, the metro extension in Warsaw, and the line recently inaugurated between Munich and Berlin. Of course we need to continue to be ambitious about our transport policy, and this message was very strongly sent and widely conveyed during the TEN-T days in Ljubljana last week. I was there, Commissioner Bulc was there, also Vice-President Šefčovič, and also Commissioner for the budget Mr Ottinger. I am please to confirm that the Commission proposal of the new multiannual financial framework reflects our high ambitions in the transport field, also within the future cohesion policy. If we want to make our transport fit for the future, we must solve, as we said, once and for all the persisting bottlenecks and missing links, especially across borders. Beyond infrastructure, transport must become cleaner and more efficient by promoting multimodality and by driving forwards the digitisation and decarbonisation of the sector. I hear your call for the promotion of alternative and innovative mobility, and I think that we can do it thanks to the cohesion policy. Its long-term, cross-cutting and cross-border development strategies offer the right frame both for action and for reform. So ladies and gentlemen, I can assure you that cohesion policy will remain a decisive catalyst for sustainable transport investments. Of course, we need to take into account new ways of supporting such investments, and financial instruments can play an important role in this regard for certain bankable  projects, but I agree with you: I think in most cases, grants remain the most effective. We will ensure better coordination between cohesion policy and the Connecting European Facility in the next financial framework, and of course I would like to thank the rapporteur for this high-quality project.

We also see that different funds can work together very well. It has also been said a moment ago: part of it is about Ten-T, but there is much more than it is in terms of modalities, mobility and, on the other hand, the underlying road network, which is supported in a very good way in the INTERREG programmes, for example. That is also important. What we have learned is that there is a different way to put pressure on the Member States. Look, in the period 2007-2014, we had the experience that, of course, the Cohesion Fund provided billions in support, but that Member States often looked at their own problems around cities, improved road or rail, or built airports without looking at the other. And what has been said now: the billions we have taken out of the Cohesion Fund and put into that CEF give you the opportunity to reach commitments quickly. If you don't do that, central management is over it. Surely this has the noses that were directed down to the self of the Member State's own self, more towards the other. It's got the noses pointing at each other. It contains an important learning point which we will certainly use for the next period — Mr Novakov was also looking for.

We agree, of course, that adequate transport connectivity is a prerequisite for the full potential of the single market and that all parts of the Union deserve to be adequately linked. Regardless of insufficiency, if it concerns islands, or inaccessible terrain, if it is mountainous and sparsely populated areas. Estimates indicate that economic losses due to insufficient transport connectivity amount to up to 1% of the Union's annual gross social product. Thus, the benefit of developing an adequate transport network is multifaceted. But when discussing the future development of transport infrastructure and optimal connectivity, we also need to think about what kind of infrastructure we develop. The aim of today's debate is to promote sustainable traffic and eliminate bottlenecks. It looks forward that the report contains proposals that further shift the sustainability of transport solutions, smart mobility, multi-day and clean transport and urban mobility, as well as, of course, the safety of passengers in traffic. A particular challenge is the further development of rail infrastructure; it notes a significantly lower utilisation rate of available funds. In the existing financial framework of 7,000 km of railway lines planned for reconstruction, a decision was made for only 980 km, and of the planned 628 km of new railway lines, the procedure was confirmed for only 16 km. Cohesion policy should therefore continue to have a thematic emphasis, while allowing some degree of flexibility to take into account the specific needs of each region. Not the same circumstances are in decidedly urban or rural areas, so-called lagging regions, as well as regions with permanent natural or geographic constraints. Only in this way can we achieve the fundamental objective - improving and uniformity of the functioning of the Single European Market, facilitating the free flow of people, goods and services throughout the European Union.

In this context, I must welcome the elimination of the last obstacles to the construction of the Peljesac Bridge in Croatia.

But investment in infrastructure — I would like to emphasise — also strengthen the internal market. We often say in the Netherlands: without transport everything stands still. Mr Novakov's report quite rightly outlines the challenges facing transport infrastructure after 2020: the completion of the trans-European transport network, the sustainability of transport and the application of innovations. These are all very important challenges. To this end, after 2020, we must all use complementary resources from the Connecting Europe Facility, the Cohesion Fund, the European Regional Development Fund, as well as funding from the European Investment Bank. I would also like to call for more resources from the European Regional Development Fund, particularly for cross-border investment projects in sustainable transport infrastructure in Europe.

Before we assume that we need more and better infrastructure, it would be necessary to propose changes in the model to make it more balanced, more decentralized, thus avoiding the enormous transport of goods and workers, the gap between cities and rural areas and tensions between overpopulation in some areas and depopulation of others.

An efficient transport network is essential for sustainable economic growth as well as for territorial balance.

This applies to all modes of transport. Without efficient transport networks, residents of more remote regions or geographically isolated cities threaten to be cut off from services and jobs. It follows that it is investment in better connectivity and accessibility of transport infrastructure that also fosters the development of the most backward regions, thereby wiping away regional disparities.

Firstly, that in our policy, in cohesion policy, transport must remain the main engine for sustainable and sustainable investment in transport. Some of you have also given concrete examples showing us, as I said, that we have achieved a great deal over the years with the help of European funds to improve the European transport network. Of course, I understand that some of you would like more funding for transport. Today, in relative terms, 20% of cohesion policy funding goes in the field of transport and mobility. In my experience, cohesion policy has been particularly important by establishing these ex-ante conditionalities, which have helped or sometimes forced Member States to develop a long-term strategy and to strike a balance between territorial development and development transport. To be honest, I think that what is crucial in the years to come, it is important, first of all, to have reserves of mature, quality projects, especially in the less developed regions of the Member States. Because, frankly, for many Member States, we have allocations waiting to be consumed here in Brussels and we do not have complete projects submitted, I am talking about feasibility studies, cost-benefit analyses, environmental agreements. So, from my point of view, I think that very often administrative capacity is much more important than the allocations, than the money that exists. We will continue to do our work in each Member State and with the same dedication we will provide technical assistance and consultancy services. As regards the issue, raised specifically, relating to the outermost regions, Madeira and the Azores, you know very well that we in the Commission have already adopted a Communication granting specific status to these outermost regions, but allocations are in the hands of the national authorities. As for the Greek islands, you also know very well that I visited them. It is a matter that I have discussed many times with governments.

Stalking is a matter of great concern and may result in serious emotional suffering and distress. It is most frequently of women, who are threatened by former or current partners and often subject to repeated victimisation. Therefore, it requires appropriate attention at all levels from the European Union and its Member States.  Our challenge in this respect is both to ensure prevention and repressive measures and to guarantee appropriate protection for the victims of stalking anywhere in the European Union. We should place their rights at the centre of all relevant initiatives and actions in our countries and across the Union.  The Council shares the concerns expressed by the European Parliament in its report of 14 March 2018 on the implementation of the European Protection Order Directive, in particular as regards cross-border cases, where victims, having obtained protection measures in one Member State, move to another Member State. There are differences in Member States’ legal systems as regards the criminalisation – or not – of stalking and in respect of the protection measures guaranteed. The Council believes that, despite these differences, we should pursue the common objective of ensuring adequate and equivalent protection of victims throughout the Union.  The Council has played a significant role both as a co-legislator and within other initiatives in respect of this sensitive issue. The European Union legal framework that we have established contains a comprehensive set of rules that, if fully implemented, can contribute to broad and effective protection of victims across the European Union.  The European Protection Order may not be applicable to all cases of stalking, as it is not currently recognised as a criminal offence in all Member States, but the Council shares the view that the expected EU accession to the Istanbul Convention – and possibly its ratification by Member States whih have not yet done so – should contribute to a more effective and coherent response to this form of violence.  The European Protection Order Directive has to be considered in conjunction with the Victims’ Rights Directive. That instrument provides for additional protection measures and for procedural rights for victims of crime. However, there are also other EU legal instruments that strengthen the position of victims, namely the Compensation Directive and the Regulation on mutual recognition of protection measures in civil matters. Stalking was explicitly mentioned by the Council in its conclusions from 2014 on the need to prevent and eliminate all forms of violence against women. Since then, the Council has – on several occasions – recalled this commitment and invited Member States to sign and ratify the Istanbul Convention.  The Council has also taken non-legislative initiatives for victim protection, in particular, the establishment of the European Network on Victims’ Rights aimed at enhancing cooperation between the competent authorities of the Member States and the access of victims to their rights. As of January this year, ENVR has a permanent organisation. It held its kick-off meeting on 23-24 April 2018 in Budapest.  The Presidency devotes particular attention to combatting all forms of gender-based violence. As a matter of fact, draft Council Conclusions on improving police co-operation in combating domestic violence and violence against women are currently being discussed, with particular focus on the protection of vulnerable victims within a multidisciplinary approach. The text of the conclusions draws on replies to a questionnaire which also covered stalking and will be submitted to the Justice and Home Affairs Council for adoption on 5 June.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 201, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Věra Jourová", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you for putting this point on the agenda of the plenary today. The definition of stalking included in the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, in its Article 34, is that it is the intentional conduct of seriously impairing a person’s psychological integrity through coercion or threats. Stalking can lead to subsequent assault. In all cases, it leaves its victims extremely vulnerable. The Istanbul Convention obliges Member States to criminalise this behaviour, and 19 Member States have done so in the process of their ratification of the Istanbul Convention. All of us here should continue to push for the ratification of the Convention by the rest of the Member States. I thank all of you who have been active on this issue. I am planning to visit those Member States that have not yet ratified the Convention. I stand ready to discuss the proposal both with citizens and with political representatives, and I will explain and try to dismantle many myths surrounding it. Two of the Member States which have not ratified the Convention have, however, criminalised stalking. These are the United Kingdom and Ireland. The Commission is aware of the differences in the legal systems of the Member States and of the fact that their national protection measures differ in scope, duration and nature. Where stalking is classified as a crime under national law, its victims can rely on all rights under the 2012 Victims’ Rights Directive. This means that such victims have a right to access to information, support and protection according to their individual needs. It is therefore crucial that Member States treat stalking as a crime. Let me underline that the right to have access to victim support services is not dependent on a formal complaint with regard to a criminal offence. This means that, even in the Member States that do not criminalise stalking, the victims should receive assistance from those services. For example, they could be guided on how to deal with their situation by other measures, like applying for an injunction order or damages for anxiety and harassment. In addition, under the rules of the European Protection Order, any victim of stalking who has been granted protection in one EU Member State should benefit from protection when she or he travels or moves to another Member State. The Commission is aware of the fact that the European Protection Order is rarely used in practice, and this needs to be addressed. National practitioners, law enforcement and judicial authorities should recommit to combating all forms of violence, including stalking. This could, for instance, be achieved by informing or offering the victim the possibility of a European Protection Order each time the domestic protection measure is adopted.

I would especially like to thank the colleagues and colleagues who supported this proposal of mine, who I naturally live firsthand, along with many other women. You see, the plague of gender-based violence has been the focus of international attention for several decades now. It is a problem that is late in stopping. Certainly, there are many progress that has been made, especially at European Union level, through the adoption of legislative provisions to prevent this dangerous conduct: perpetrators and protect victims and persons at risk by providing them with adequate services. I refer, for example, as you have already expressed, to the European Protection Order, the so-called Victims Directive and the Istanbul Convention. The Istanbul Convention is the first instrument in Europe with which legally binding rules have been set to prevent, protect and punish this criminal conduct, but it is also the first instrument to intervene and include among the various offences that of stalking, defined as “persecutory acts”. Stalking is an offence often still legally underestimated and, alas, recognised in Europe in only 21 of the European countries. This is a problem, because we must make it as homogeneous as possible and we must as much as possible harmonise this aspect which, alas, does not find uniformity, harmonisation in all 28 Member States. The behaviours we see about stalking, as the daily chronicle unfortunately teaches us, even degenerate into further and more serious crimes, such as personal injury and murder. And then, in the light of this — and I am going towards conclusions — I would like to ask you questions and intentions to the Commission. First: intervene with a specific legislative proposal; second: proceed towards an awareness activity and at the same time, on the experience of a concrete analysis of the data you have verified, whether to use the mandate of European shutdown.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 203, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Cécile Kashetu KYENGE", "mepid": "124801", "text": " on behalf of the S&D Group. — Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, the physical and psychological violence to which victims of stalking in the European Union are subjected is aberrant. Persecutions can take on countless modes of manifestation, but they always have in common an obsessive imprint that leads the victim to fear above all for their own safety, a sense of fear that characterizes daily life, a real limitation on personal freedom. As many forms are, so are the needles. Statistics show that the numbers of stalking cases within the home walls or after the end of a relationship are high. The control that a spouse, a cohabitant, can exercise is enormous and leaves the victim lacking any place to feel safe. And for this reason it also takes more attention to migrant women. Measures such as protection orders, removal from the family home or the prescription of non-approach to places usually frequented are instruments of protection that can make a difference and greatly improve the daily lives of the victims, but they cannot be the only passable routes. We need to provide a better legislative guarantee for the protection of victims of persecution, take the good practices that exist in Europe — I speak, for example, of my country, Italy. It also serves a strong investment from an educational point of view, because the best long-term measure is more effective education and active cultural engagement. We can't wait any longer. We cannot let such an important issue have uneven regulation within the EU.

At first contact, it is necessary to ensure access to all information in the simplest possible language, translation and interpretation in terms of interrogation and continuous information, and sufficient legal and psychological support. The theme of stalking, that is, dangerous persecution or harassment by persecution, is very serious. However, I want to point out the thin ice on which we move. There is a danger that innocent people's reputation may be ruined by crooked accusations. According to a report by the United States Department of Justice, 43% of male stalking victims said the perpetrator was a woman. I want to call on my colleagues to a fair debate that will not demonise only one sex, especially men. Let us protect women from any form of violence, but let us not make men and women irreconcilable rivals. Our differences are a gift from the Creator, through which we are to complement ourselves and live in harmony. But I regret that Commissioner Jouro has once again used the expression that we will press the Member States to ratify the Istanbul Convention.

And this situation needs to be changed, because we must put into practice measures such as training for prosecutors, training for police officers, have a non-exhaustive list in our legal systems of what harassment means. All these things must be in our legal systems, and it is very important that institutions act. Therefore, I think we have to do two things fundamentally. First, as has been said, to urge all Member States to ratify the Istanbul Convention, which clearly states that Member States should introduce harassment into their criminal codes. And from that point of view, I join the voices that call on the Bulgarian Presidency to please ratify the Istanbul Convention at once, because the Presidency has not done so does not undermine much legitimacy from many of the things it is coming to us.

Reducing red tape and simplifying procedures to ensure that victims are protected when travelling to other Member States are important steps in the right direction. What has long been enabled for all people in the European Union will be especially guaranteed to victims of violence through the new legislative framework.

The question we have to ask ourselves today is whether the European instruments we have are sufficiently equipped to make a real difference in the approach, particularly in relation to cross-border situations. Commissioner Jourová, you rightly said that victims have rights throughout the European Union that they should be able to exercise. But what about the approach of the perpetrators? Stalking is not on the list of offences for which a European arrest warrant can be issued. At the same time, this means that, if we suspect that an offender may be repeated, we cannot include a warning in the Schengen Information System in case he leaves to another country. The question is whether we should change something about that. And my appeal is to the European Commission and to the Member States: work with us to find a solution to these problems specifically.

We have important pieces of European legislation and a lot of national laws – for instance, as was just mentioned, the criminal law in Hungary – which must be properly enforced. That’s the point: that we need legislation plus enforcement. I think that we still have a lot of work to do on a European Protection Order. I mentioned before that we have to increase awareness among the professionals and also among the victims that this instrument exists and that they can use it in a situation when it is needed. A lot has been said here about the Istanbul Convention, so I want to come back to this briefly. I want to inform you that, on the EU accession to the Istanbul Convention, the Commission is working closely with the Bulgarian Presidency to make progress on the conclusion of the EU’s accession to the Convention. We are now working on the Code of Conduct and the specification of all the legal circumstances, so I think we are on the right track. Regarding ratification in the Member States, on Monday I was in Bulgaria and had a very fruitful – although quite heated – debate with people who are for and people who are against the ratification of the Istanbul Convention, and I realised that we have to do much better in explaining to our citizens what the Istanbul Convention is about: that it is not, for instance, introducing the third gender into the national legal order, nor is it pushing the Member States to legalise gay marriage. This is the Convention whose main purpose is to fight against violence against women and children; to fight against domestic violence and all very brutal forms of violence, including female genital mutilation, forced sterilisation, forced marriages, and all kinds of violence, including stalking, rape and so on. We need to do be much better at explaining and also in looking into the translation of the text of the Convention in different Member States, because in the Bulgarian language – and also in the Czech language by the way – we do not differentiate between the words gender and sex, and this creates a lot of misunderstanding and misconceptions. So we have to work more on this. I confirmed in Bulgaria that I am not pushing any Member State to ratify, but I am honestly trying to convince the Member States, because from the bottom of my heart I am convinced that this is the way to achieve the proper harmonisation of the criminal offences of violence against women and children, and this is simply a very useful piece of legislation which we are obliged to have in order to help the victims of such violence. Finally, concerning the Victims’ Rights Directive: you all know that the directive was adopted in 2012 and entered into force in November 2015. The level of transposition was not satisfactory so, in January 2016, the Commission started infringement proceedings against 16 Member States for non—notification of national measures transposing the directive. Some of the infringements are still ongoing. This is again a very practical piece of legislation which needs proper implementation in the Member States and the introduction of all the measures, which should serve the better treatment of victims and give better assistance to victims, which requires this to be brought into practical life in the Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 217, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I would like to conclude by stressing that we share the view that stalking and the protection of its victims is an issue of common concern that touches upon the core values of the European Union, and therefore need to be addressed with a high level of commitment by both the European Union institutions and the Member States. Concerning the calls upon Bulgaria made by the honourable Members of the European Parliament Lenaers, Urtasun and López Aguilar, the Convention is part of an internal debate in my country and I would like to underline that I am here today in the capacity of Presidency of the Council, representing all EU Member States. Therefore, I am not in a position to enter into details of the current situation in Bulgaria. Nevertheless, I would like to underline that it is beyond any doubt that Bulgarian society is firmly opposed to any form of violence against women. The fact that the Convention was included as a priority file in our presidency programme is a clear demonstration that the Bulgarian Government is convinced of its importance, and we have taken the decision to do so in permanent consultation with the European Parliament, and in particular with the Chair of the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality. Unfortunately, there is still a high level of polarisation in the Bulgarian political elite and society. Society is not ready and the government has to act within these limits. We would like to broaden the debate to have our whole parliament and our society on board so that the Convention can be implemented effectively.  At present, we are waiting for clarification from the constitutional court concerning certain aspects of the Convention in relation to the Bulgarian constitution, and I am convinced that this will contribute to reassuring public opinion. It will also clarify many legal issues and will contribute to a more constructive debate on the topic. We will assess the situation in the light of the court’s ruling. As a presidency, we are doing our best to finalise the discussions on the code of conduct so that the Council is in a position afterwards to adopt the decision on the conclusions of the Istanbul Convention by the European Union. The Council is also committed to proceed further on the subject. During the forthcoming Justice and Home Affairs Council in June, the Council is expected to call for a comprehensive approach and for a wide range of actions to be taken by the Commission, the Member States and the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) in order to enhance the prevention and detection of, investigation into and protection against all acts of gender-based violence, including those that cause or are likely to cause psychological harm or suffering to women, for example, stalking.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 218, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": " The debate has ended.

It can lead to legitimate concerns about life and health, it can give a sense of violating the personal sphere. It can occur at work as well as in private situations. Today it is punished in the legislation of most Member States of the European Union. My country introduced a proper provision into the criminal code a few years ago. At the same time, allegations of committing this offence should be approached with some caution. If they were to radically interpret the concept of “harassment,” it could be punishable any attempt to make contact that would not be desired by the other person. Such an interpretation would risk dehumanizing contacts between people, because we would be afraid to establish any kind of extra-national relationship because of the risk of harassment. I therefore hope that the interpretation of this law, however it makes sense in quite numerous cases, will not be extended beyond common sense. It should be noted that this crime occurs most often in two situations: harassment by former partners (here most often women fall victim) and in an online environment (mainly social media). These cases, however, can be thankfully, as a rule, relatively easily proven. However, there is no awareness that such behaviour is punishable.

The debate we just had on stalking and victim protection shows that work is ongoing to prevent such violence, to punish perpetrators and to protect victims. The Council shares the view that the European Union’s accession to the Istanbul Convention will be an important step towards establishing a more coherent new legal framework to better prevent and combat violence against women. Honourable Members, you will understand that it wouldn’t be appropriate for the Council to comment on a criminal law case, adjudicated by a national court. This was underlined in this room at the opening of our session today and I share this view. The justice systems of Member States have their own control mechanisms and the victim and the perpetrators have the right to appeal the judgment. It is not the role of the Council to interfere in the process. To conclude, there is no doubt that in our societies, there must be zero tolerance of all forms of violence against women.

Sexual violence is a pervasive form of gender-based violence with serious consequences on an individual and societal level, including emotional, psychological and physical harm to survivors that can potentially last a lifetime. More than one in 10 women in the EU have suffered some form of sexual violence by a partner or by someone else. One woman in 20 in the EU has been raped. The Commission is fully committed to tackling all forms of gender-based violence, including sexual violence. This is one of the five priorities of our strategic engagement for gender equality. The Victims’ Rights Directive is the main EU instrument on the rights of victims of gender-based violence. By implementing the Victims’ Rights Directive properly, Member States ensure that all victims, including victims of sexual violence, are heard, effectively supported, and protected. Allow me to recall that the EU is also in the process of acceding to the Council of Europe Convention on combating violence against women – the Istanbul Convention – which it signed in June 2017. The Convention criminalises sexual violence, including rape. The Convention’s definition is in Article 36 and clearly states that consent must be given voluntarily as a result of the person’s free will, and that such consent should be assessed in the context of the surrounding circumstances. Honourable Members, allow me to conclude that, while Spain is among the 19 Member States that have ratified the Istanbul Convention, we still have Member States which have not done so yet.

As long as it continues, we will never be able to affirm that we are moving towards equality, towards development and towards peace. We have the right to live without fear, without violence, without guilt, without burdens, without anguish and without uncertainties, and we are here to fight for a right that belongs to us. It is a threat to democracy, it is an obstacle to peace. The facts, undoubtedly, show the utmost contempt for women's dignity. The aggressors, miserable ones who deserve all our contempt for the violation of a person's most basic right, sexual freedom and dignity. We all share that violence, along the lines of the Istanbul Convention and the United Nations, is to violate will. Being a woman is a risk factor, it is not random violence, but only nine out of thirty-three countries in the European Union recognize this simple truth: that sex without consent is rape. The rest of the countries, including Spain, define rape in terms of violence and intimidation, and that is what the legislator wanted in 1995 in Spain; and that is what the courts of justice have applied; that is what is the legal framework in Spain. There are two appeals, there will be appeals before the Supreme Court, which would undoubtedly enlighten future jurisprudence. Such archaic regulation and stereotyped regulation lead to the absurdity that women herself must be responsible for protecting herself from rape. That has to change, but for that we need a serene reflection, a calm reflection. There is also an urgent need to train all, and especially legal operators, on gender perspectives in order to banish stereotypes and harm forever. Criticizing judges is not the way. It is not understanding anything about the valuable gift of living in a rule of law. If the we criticize, we truly compromise the trust our justice system deserves of citizens. The road is another.

I just want to say that I'm horrified, disgusted and cursed. How can anything like this happen in the EU? We already know, and research has clearly shown, that people who are in a very exposed situation sometimes fail to put it in words. It's called a frozen fright and is a survival mechanism that causes one to be paralyzed. I'm sure that's what happened when the vile so-called wolf pack molested itself on the 18-year-old woman. Cases of paralyzation like this must take into account a legal assessment. Something else is unthinkable. It is vitally important that people who become vulnerable to crimes feel that they can trust the courts and the judiciary, that their experiences of what they have been exposed to are taken seriously. Unfortunately, it rarely happens to rape victims. In the EU, gender violence is a very big problem. Every third woman in the EU has been the victim of physical or sexual violence. Violence against women is a brutal form of discrimination and a violation of human rights. It is not only harmful to the women who are exposed and affected, but to the whole of society — the whole of Europe at large. Therefore, the issue must be taken very seriously. All the men — you men who are here in the hall and you other men listening — have to take responsibility, and we need to start working on the man role. It should be a foregone conclusion to everyone, both women and men, that sex is based on consent. Anything but a “yes” is a “no” and everything else is illegal. It's supposed to sit in the spine of every single one of us. That is why I feel extra proud that my home country, Sweden, should now pass strengthened sex crimes legislation, a consent law. It should be a matter of course in all EU Member States. Here now comes a serious call to the governments of all Member States. Protections for those who face rape and sexual violence must increase. We cannot, under any conditions, accept anything else. That is why I recall once again that all Member States of the EU completely must implement and endorse the Istanbul Convention. It would be particularly desirable for the Presidency Bulgaria to take the lead and show the other countries, which have not yet ratified, the importance of the Istanbul Convention.

I want to recall once again that we need the laws and they must be properly implemented and applied in the Member States. At EU level, we have the Victims’ Rights Directive, which must be properly applied. This Directive provides specifically that victims of this kind of criminal offence must be treated well. I can imagine the victim of this horrible case – and many other victims – have to repeat again and again what has happened to them and the torture is prolonged. That’s why in the Victims’ Rights Directive, we want the law enforcement authorities to handle these cases with full sensitivity and full professionalism. We also have the European Protection Order, which needs to be used better, and you are right that more enlightenment, more information and more training of professionals is needed. We desperately need to have the Istanbul Convention ratified in all the Member States because it specifically addresses cases like that. As I said, we seriously need the laws to be in place, and full and good implementation, including the application and interpretation by the European courts is seriously necessary. I am not here to criticise the decisions of the Spanish court or any other courts; I just want to say that I do hope that the court of appeal in Spain will decide this specific case swiftly and fairly.  I want to say one more thing. If the courts do not interpret the law in the proper way so that they interpret rape as rape – and I don’t mean this specific case; I speak in general terms because I really don’t want to criticise the Spanish court – if the law is not interpreted properly then the perpetrators will see impunity in these cases. They will see that this is authorised by the State, this is allowed, this is cheap, this is easy. I think that this is not only a legal problem, this is also a hazard. In our society, many people still have a very strong conviction that if a woman is raped or has been raped, she provoked it, she deserved it, she caused it through her own behaviour, and we need to stop this. We need to properly and continuously influence public opinion so that there is lower or zero tolerance in society with regard to these cases. In that regard, the functioning and decision-making of the courts is absolutely essential. Again, I hope that the victim of this case receives a fair decision soon and is able to forget the case as soon as possible, if possible.

It was a great teamwork, indicating the sensitivity of all groups on the subject. There are more than 30 000 children who arrived in Europe in 2017 and among them there are very many unaccompanied ones, who by themselves are the most vulnerable because they are most exposed to the risk of abuse, exploitation and violence. Since the start of the migration crisis, much has been done at European level to address the needs of children and their families, but unfortunately even today some Member States do not implement the recommendations contained in the Commission Communication on the Protection of Migrant Minors, presented more than a year ago. It is alarming, for example, to see that, in some countries of the Union, migrant minors are still being held solely because of their condition as migrants and we hope that this is the Council wishes to share and support Parliament's position, which has long called for the abolition of this practice and the preparation by national authorities of reception systems based on suitable communities and facilities, separate from those for adults, to accommodate minors, especially unaccompanied ones, and families with children. With the resolution to be adopted tomorrow, I hope unanimously, this Parliament intends to reiterate once again the need to ensure these children the necessary safeguards from the moment of arrival on European territory, guaranteeing them the appointment of a guardian, adequate housing and access to education, health care and all social services. These safeguards should also be accompanied by procedures for registering migrant minors, including those for the collection of biometric data, conducted for the exclusive purpose of their protection, thus excluding the recourse to measures coercive, in full compliance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However, it is essential for the dismantling of trafficking in human beings and to prevent the disappearance of children, that the Union should work to create legal and safe immigration channels with sharing, on the part of all Member States, the principle of solidarity and responsibility, at least towards children.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "aws", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 255, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Anna Maria CORAZZA BILDT", "mepid": "96674", "text": "   author. – Mr President, I am proud that today we stand united across the political groups for children’s rights. A child is first a child, regardless of the migration status. Migrant children are vulnerable: exposed to trafficking, abuse and exploitation during the journey and even in Europe. Our resolution is a call for action from the Member States to do more, better and faster, to protect children on the move. They must implement the asylum rules and build capacity, providing access to health care and psychological support, in particular for girls sexually exploited; accommodation and safe areas; school, to restore a sort of normal life and avoid a lost generation; appointing a guardian to unaccompanied minors within five days; and all children from the age of six arriving in Europe must be registered with fingerprints, in full respect of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, without using force. Registration is crucial to ensure that children enter and remain in the protection system. It can help authorities find missing children. Children should not be detained just because they are migrants. In case of crime, they should be treated as EU nationals. Children’s dignity must be respected when doing medical examinations for age assessment. And we have a responsibility to ensure that refugee children go from fear to hope for the future. When given a real chance to integrate, they can become an asset to our societies in Europe, and education is key for integration and to prevent crime and radicalisation. It should include learning about our European values and languages, and respect for women and the rule of law. We also need to tackle the root causes of migration. Let’s not forget all those kids who didn’t make it to Europe, in the desert, in the Mediterranean. I was just in Niger, in Agadez, Africa’s trafficking hub in the Sahara Desert. It was heart-breaking to meet so many children victims of violence. But these tragic stories are the same that are heard from migrant children whom I met in refugee camps in Turkey, in Greece, in hotspots in Sicily, and even in reception centres in Sweden. The EU is doing a lot in Africa, but much more needs to be done, in particular for the Investing in Children programme.

I'd like to start with Nimo, who was 6 years old when she fled Somalia. “We stayed in the Sahara for a long time, more than 3 months. We slept outside on the ground. We used our shoes as a pillow. The men who took us were mean. Whoever ran away was beaten with a stick. Because you had to pay first, otherwise you couldn't leave. The smugglers once told Grandma that they would release her if she gave me to the men. Fortunately, she didn't do that.” So little Nimo. This story shows very clearly to me that this debate and this resolution on children in migration are essential. Ladies and gentlemen, two years ago, Europol came out with a report which clearly stated that 10 000 unaccompanied minor asylum seekers have disappeared in Europe. The children would have ended up in prostitution, child labour, killed for their organs or living with their families in another European country, without our knowledge. I proposed a book last week called “Where are they?” Where are they? And I must tell you that I have been able to quote staggering figures about Belgium. In 2017, 124 missing children were reported to Child Focus in Belgium. And do you know how much in custody service? 618! How can that be? How is it that we in Belgium do not even have the right figures on disappearances? But, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the case in Belgium. I also called around to other countries. It is estimated that 5700 in Italy, 700 in Austria, 318 in Sweden and 290 in the Netherlands, but there is no one, nobody in Europe, who can give the exact figure, and that in itself is a pure disgrace. That is why we are actually delighted that this resolution sets out the points. Let us start with numbers, so that we have the data. data, photos, fingerprints and of course taken in a child-friendly way and only to protect them. 2. No more prisons! Identifying guardians, psychological counselling and education. 3. Faster family reunion within Europe. That, too, sometimes takes months.

When we were able to visit the Balkan route 2015/16, many migrants told us that children disappeared. One of them reappeared in other places, the others disappeared forever. They were slaughtered for organ trafficking, enslaved as workers, abused for sexual services or somehow and somewhere died. The EU has been aware of the fact that children on the run are most at risk for a long time, but it does nothing! Although the protection of children is the first duty of a society. Incidentally, it does not matter where the children come from. The EU and the Member States are doing nothing because it is more important to them to seal borders than to protect children's lives. No matter how the Commission and the Member States — no matter what you say today, Mrs Jourová — is the fate of these children, also shows the fact that no single consistent, genuinely vigorous action has actually been taken to address child trafficking and child abuse. And the fact that you do not care about the children in your heart is shown by the fact that to this day, migrant children can be put in an asylum prison in any Member State of our European Union — if a Member State wants it. We consider it a violation of human rights when children are interned. We demand that families be brought together as soon as possible and that children be given what they are entitled to: family and security, not barbed wire!

We know that the response across the European Union in terms of children in the asylum system and children in migration is still very fragmented. There is still much work to be done in terms of joining the dots to give a holistic response, and with a focus on durable solutions, and that includes children who are undocumented or stateless. We still do not have all Member States having a statelessness procedure that really works. So progress is slow, there is a lack of resources going to the local and regional level, certainly from EU money, and I think we need to reconsider how we are spending and directing that to really get the increase that we need in training and indeed in a much, much better system. We also need to concentrate on implementing the legislation that we have because that is pretty poorly implemented in many of our Member States. In terms of protection and the basics of life – shelter, food, safety – no child in the European Union should be having to sell themselves to get any of those things and there are many today who do. When the legal guardian system works, it works really well. In the European Parliament, we heard only last week about a young man, Julien Makalu, who had been thrown into jail on his arrival in the European Union, but had been helped by a legal adviser and is now an engineering student at a Greek university. He spoke about the enormous difference to his life that having the support of that legal guardian had made.

The Commission and the EU agencies fully support Member States in implementing these actions. In the meantime, large numbers of children continue to arrive to Europe. According to the latest data published by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in March this year, between January and September 2017, 25 379 children arrived in Greece, Italy, Spain and Bulgaria. Of those, 58% were unaccompanied or separated children. The arrival of unaccompanied and separated children has actually increased by 25% compared to the first half of 2016. The challenges identified in our communication and its recommendations are therefore still very relevant and very important. It is time to ask what has been achieved by the Member States so far in terms of implementing the communication and the recommendations of the Commission. Over the past year, the Commission and the EU agencies stepped up the work to support Member States to reinforce the protection of migrant children. However, child protection for migrant children is still fragmented – as you rightly pointed out – across Member States. A number of challenges still need to be addressed, following also our recommendations, in order to make the policy on the protection of children in migration tangible and consistent. Overall, I cannot agree with the opinion that we have done nothing, but I also fully admit that we must do much better. We still need to take a big step forward to improve cross-border cooperation as well as communication on aspects concerning migrant children. We monitor progress achieved in the implementation of the communication also through bi-annual joint meetings with the representatives from the Member States. The next meeting is scheduled to take place in early June this year, and we will pass the same messages there too.  More generally, we need to find the right balance between the effective EU migration management policy and ensuring adequate protection for the most vulnerable. In order to meet these challenges the Commission will continue to prioritise the protection needs of migrant children in EU funding. Our financial support should also reach the regional and local authorities, which have a key role with respect to integration and social inclusion measures including access to formal, inclusive education and non—discriminatory access to other services.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 260, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, the situation we are facing with the migrant children is heart-breaking and horrifying in equal measure.

This issue is the litmus test of the strength of our European way. It is being put to the test and we have two choices. Do we double down on our values or do we turn our backs? The populists would turn and then manipulate the issue to try to get elected. I say that the time to pander to them must end. I am a proud Maltese Christian Democrat. I am also unashamedly a pro-life politician – probably one of the few – but it would be utterly hypocritical of me, or of anyone like me, to speak out for the unborn, but then turn our backs on children fleeing Syria, starvation or hopelessness just because they were born elsewhere.  By all means let’s have all the necessary security verification procedures in place, let’s close all the loopholes and let’s ensure identification, but let’s also counter the thinking that leads so many people to believe that these children are somehow so different from our own that we allow them to become scapegoats and cheap electoral punch bags. As has been said, unaccompanied children need guardianship, not prison guards, playpens and not barbed wire. They need child rights protection officers, respect, books and access to education. We have the resources to do this. States have a legal obligation to do this, and we must ensure that they do.

I was happy to have such an experience; it was very enriching. This was a very important and serious debate, so let me briefly react to some of the comments.  I think it is quite clear that the problem of children in migration and creating better conditions for them, especially security and perspective, requires cooperation at all levels, starting from the EU institutions, through the Member States at regional and local level, but also civil society organisations. We all have the obligation to strictly follow the principle of acting in the best interests of the child, because this is not only a legal and political obligation; it is also, and especially, a moral imperative.  We will discuss it with the Member States in June, as I said before. We will look back into the Commission Communication and Recommendation and we will discuss seriously what has been done and what still needs to be done. Much has been done in the field of training and deploying more capacities. We are continuing funding programmes. You would be surprised how flexible the funding is, because we try to react to current needs and urgent needs. I will not go into details, because of the time pressure. We will be more, let us say, strict in asking Member States to facilitate guardians for the children because, rightly, and for very good reason, we set a five-day deadline for choosing guardians for the children since if this does not happen then there are very frequent cases of children going missing. This is a sensitive moment and we have a duty to have guardians for them as soon as possible.  Regarding the fingerprinting of children, we proposed a reform of the European Asylum Dactyloscopy Database (Eurodac) to lower the age for taking fingerprints and facial images to six years, precisely to strengthen the protection of children in migration and, in all cases, fingerprinting of minors must be carried out in full respect of their rights and best interests. By the way, it was very urgently recommended by the people working on the ground, in the hot spots. They warned us that the lack of identification is also one of the causes of children going missing. My last comment is on the detention of children. I have to stress here, again, that the administrative detention of children should only be used, in line with EU law, exclusively in exceptional circumstances and where strictly necessary. It should only be used as a last resort where no less coercive measures are available, for the shortest possible time and always in dedicated closed centres. This is very important to stress.  As a very last comment, I think that we, first of all, have to offer children a perspective, because providing them with food and bed cannot be enough. I think it is our obligation, as you rightly pointed out, to provide them with an education and full integration into our society.

According to Europol, more than ten thousands migrant and refugee children have gone missing after their arrival in EU, victims of human trafficking and extreme abuses. The main barrier in combating this worrying phenomenon is the lack of data (biometrical data and fingerprints) which leads to an incapacity of traceability of migrant and refugee children across EU. Consequently, I stress the importance to reinforce the procedures of data collecting at all EU all borders and assemble effective mechanisms of prevention and responses. With regards to prevention, it is decisive that missing children detected across the Union are immediately identified, registered and assigned to child protection authorities, and further hosted in different establishment than adults in order to prevent risks of violence and other abuses.

Social workers helping minors are constantly present in transit zones, police officers and staff working there receive special training, and minors have access to education in all cases. At the same time, a large percentage of migrants falsely claim to be minors in order to benefit from special procedures for children, thus concealing their criminal record. Therefore, I consider it very important that minors can be used as simple and rapid dating as possible, and to oblige them to provide their biometric data.

Member States are therefore called upon to do everything in their power to serve the best interests of the child. There is still a lack of child protection facilities in the Member States to provide psychological and psychiatric support for refugee minors. Cross-border cooperation will need to step up the search for missing children and to step up the fight against child trafficking. In hotspots and border crossings, access to child protection officers must be provided. However, integration in the Member States must also be further promoted. In order to ensure rapid integration, the assistance of the Member States is also required.

As a result, the European cosmetics industry has prospered. It has been involved in a number of research projects and has developed excellent alternative methods that are more reliable for consumers. Consumers have thus gotten better cosmetics for themselves. We have avoided a very large amount of pointless and cruel animal testing. Once alternative methods have been developed — the EU is currently involved in 33 different research projects — it turns out that animal testing is also extremely unreliable. Only about 60 per cent of people's reproductive health risks, about 40 per cent of skin irritations and about 42 per cent of carcinogenic effects are noticed. Instead, alternative methods based on stem cell platforms, among other things, more quickly deliver significantly more reliable and, in many cases, lower-cost results, both for cosmetics and also for other products. So we can say on the subject that testing on animals is archaic, ineffective and extremely cruel. Indeed, the EU has been a success story that has been watched so far for many countries. However, about 80 percent of products still contain ingredients tested on animals or are tested on animals. Although it also applies to products marketed in the EU, it is very difficult to obtain information about the origin of products and their control has proved very difficult. What we need now and what Parliament is asking both the Commission and the Council at present is an active action to bring about a global ban on animals in terms of cosmetics. We need an international agreement, a code of conduct within the framework of the UN, standards and a global campaign to ban testing cosmetics on animals by 2023. We appeal to both the Council and the Commission that, following this debate and resolution, they would deploy their resources not only directly to the UN, its Secretary-General, but also to all like-minded and currently still divisive UN Member States in order to achieve this ban. It is also important that both existing and future trade agreements include a testing animal ban on cosmetics. When these tests have shown that alternative tests produce more reliable results, both for the consumer, namely for humans, and avoid unnecessary animal suffering, and in many cases also save costs, it is very important that we also invest together in the Commission and the EU budget resources to validate, develop and prompt adoption of alternative tests — including in non-cosmetic areas where results are completely similar to cosmetics tests, both in terms of reliability and development. We need international cooperation, we need resources, but we need a little humanity before everyone. It is worth remembering that what we often call the most deeply human in us, such as emotions, caring, the ability to suffer, are the most deeply animalistic parts of us all. What we do to animals speaks very much about us, about our own culture, our ethics and what kind of people we are and want to be.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fi", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 287, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Monika PANAYOTOVA", "mepid": "116663", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the possibility of a global ban on animal testing for cosmetic products with you today. Your question touches upon several aspects of this important issue, which is of great interest for consumers worldwide. I would like to take the questions you raised one by one, insofar as they fall within the sphere of activity and competence of the Council.  In the introduction to their questions, the honourable Members point out that the European Union ban on animal testing for cosmetic products, which is stipulated in Article 18 of the Cosmetics Regulation, and fully applicable in the Internal Market since March 2013, has had positive consequences. As a co-legislator which is co-responsible for this outcome, the Council certainly shares your view.  Your further questions point more to the future. Regarding the current global impact and acceptance by third countries of the EU ban on animal testing for cosmetics, we have to differentiate between a statistical-economic part and a legal part. The Council does not specifically analyse the global impact of the EU ban on trade flows. This task is more for the Commission, and the Commissioner will most probably be able to say more.  According to my information, EU industry and EU consumers have so far not registered any more major problems with regard to profitability or availability of products. From the legal side, an acceptance of the EU ban by third countries is not specifically necessary in the sense that third countries can regulate their own markets as they see fit. Rather, we should speak of an acceptance by third country producers, which is an absolute condition in order to place cosmetics on the EU market. This has been confirmed by the Court of Justice in the European Federation for Cosmetic Ingredients case in 2016.  In this regard, again, I am not aware of any major disruption, but even if producers were finding it difficult to place products on the European market, the European legislator would continue to favour the public interest of animal health over the interest of individual third country producers. On the issue of ensuring that all cosmetics placed on the EU market have never been tested on animals in a third country, as the Treaty makes clear, this is in the first instance a task for Member States. As you, the honourable Members, are aware, market surveillance authorities enforce the Cosmetics Regulation in the same way as they enforce any other Union internal market legislation. Article 4 of the Cosmetics Regulation requires a responsible person within the Union to ensure compliance of the products with the Regulation, and Article 11 provides for a Product Information File for every product to be placed on the EU market, irrespective of its place of production. Article 18 specifies in great detail the EU ban on animal testing.  As for any other product, it is not for the Council as a legislative and policy-making institution, but for the market surveillance authorities of the Member States to check and verify that every product complies with the European rules. On the issue of an international agreement to put an end to the testing of cosmetics on animals worldwide, the Council would examine attentively any recommendations from the Commission to open negotiations regarding such an agreement. Any such agreement would obviously have to be compatible with the Cosmetics Regulation. It would be for the Commission to carry out such negotiations, on the basis of, and in line with, a mandate from the Council. Provided the negotiations lead to a successful outcome, the Council would then be in a position to conclude such an agreement on behalf of the Union. This leads me to the question of promoting a global ban at the UN. As I have just explained, in line with its competences under the Treaty, the Council would stand ready to exercise its responsibilities on the international level.  Finally, on the question of a possible conflict with trade agreements and WTO rules, the Council is convinced that the Cosmetics Regulation is in conformity with WTO rules and other trade agreements. It is not for the Council, as a Union co-legislator, to enforce WTO rules. Nevertheless, let me point out that under the WTO system, multilateral action is usually preferred to a unilateral one.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 288, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Elżbieta Bieńkowska", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, thank you very much for this question and for the opportunity to discuss it today. Animal welfare is an extremely important topic for European citizens. It is also important for me personally, so thank you very much.  This importance is reflected in the very high animal welfare standards that apply in the EU. It was also, may I remind you, reflected in the very unanimous and strong condemnation of the private tests, for example, mandated lately by some car makers on monkeys in the US. Over the last five years we have led the way with our animal testing ban on cosmetics. The ban not only signals our commitment to animal welfare in the European Union, but also a new approach to human safety. I want to say it very strongly: we do not need to protect humans by harming animals.  It is also visible that during those five years since the ban entered into force, our industry still remains number one in the world. The ban has had an impact also on third countries. It is difficult of course to assess the precise global impact of it, but it is clear that it has inspired many other countries in the world. We have been active in ensuring that it does so in our bilateral contacts and cooperation with third countries. We want as many countries as possible to follow. We have also been very active in developing alternatives to animal testing within the EU, and again we are promoting the acceptance and uptake outside the EU, notably through the OECD. But I have to say again, sadly, that not all of our main trading partners have followed us. We should think about what this means for the treatment of cosmetics imported into the EU. The question is first of all that of enforcement of the ban by the national competent authorities. In practice, the main way of checking compliance of individual cosmetics is the cosmetics products information file. This has to be kept for every cosmetic marketed within the EU. But of course it is clear from information that we received from Member States that this file is sometimes very incomplete.  Secondly, the Court of Justice recently confirmed that cosmetic products containing ingredients tested on animals outside the EU cannot be sold here in the European Union. The animal testing data obtained outside the EU cannot be relied on. The safety has to be proved using some alternatives, but there is of course no guarantee that cosmetics tested on animals outside the EU are not used by our European customers. This needs to change.  One solution could be a global ban. This is the reason why we will continue to support any initiative at international level to end animal testing in cosmetics. And our support will go in particular to any initiative by EU Member States proposing a UN resolution on this matter. The Commission will continue to promote the EU ban on animal testing in cosmetics through its international activities, both at bilateral and multilateral level.  We also considered proposing clauses on animal testing for future trade agreements whenever appropriate. Our ban is firmly in line with the WTO technical barrier to trade agreement. This specifies that technical regulations shall not be more trade restrictive than necessary to fulfil a legitimate objective. Animal life or health is mentioned as such a legitimate objective.  The agreement is also the guiding principle in the EU’s bilateral free trade agreements. So, it has to be said that five years after the EU animal testing ban became fully applicable, the time is ripe for global action. We are thinking carefully about how best to do this. A global ban is of course one option, but we will consider others, and I will keep you informed and involved as our thinking develops.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 289, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Seán KELLY", "mepid": "96668", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I welcome Commissioner Bieńkowska’s commitment and intent, as she outlined just now, because in 2004 the EU banned animal testing for cosmetic products and five years later it banned animal testing for cosmetic ingredients.

Sadly, up to 80% of countries around the world still use animal testing and continue to allow for the marketing of animal-tested cosmetics. I am hopeful that this cruel and inhumane practice will be eliminated entirely by 2023. These EU prohibitions in recent years have been hugely significant for the promotion of animal welfare. As well as this, Europe’s cosmetic products market is the biggest in the world and provides approximately two million jobs at present.

We have given industry and research long enough time — the previous speakers have said: the first move in 2004, and then a definitive general ban on marketing in 2013. This best practice shows that, together with industry, a lot can be achieved with research here. We have continued to secure our market, we can be sure that the products that reach consumers are products that are not harmful to health, and we have taken a major step towards animal welfare and animal welfare. I believe that this appeal to achieve a global ban on animal testing for cosmetics is an important one, because we may also be able to achieve pressure here for those products that are not yet covered by this regulation, namely those ingredients that can still be tested by animal testing today, because you can also find other applications in the field of pharmaceutics, in the field of detergents, etc. This means that perhaps we can really provide incentives here to ensure that these ingredients also fall under the ban in the future, because there are alternatives. I would ask you, as you have pointed out today, to work to ensure that these requirements are not softened, particularly through WTO rules.

I say “they should” because we know — and colleagues also reminded — how it is difficult to have a full application of this ban. There are many beams and loopholes that we see in the legislation, not least that of not often having a full count of the information of products from third countries or the ingredients that are tested and retested because they are also subject to other European regulations, such as REACH. This is, however, an important step forward which the European Union makes towards animal protection, but not only, in relation to different economic development, in relation to the protection of people's health. But now we must go further and support the conclusion of a global agreement to ban this practice, which is sadly used in 80% of the countries of the world. We have to listen to those millions of people who loudly ask us to work towards an international moratorium and these millions of people are also felt through, for example, petitions.

Now, 15 years later, there are still products in the store that have been tested on animals. In Europe, for example, the chemicals legislation on REACH still gives scope to carry out animal testing.

Indeed, as coordinator in the ENVI committee, I had proposed to my colleagues to conduct a global reflection, not just on cosmetics. Indeed, the real progress made in the development of alternative methods for these cruel tests, including in the medical field, is proof that animal testing is not an obligation, as some sometimes want us to believe. However, one problem remains: the majority of ingredients used in cosmetic products are the same as those used in the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, detergents and sometimes even foodstuffs. However, in these specific cases, animal testing benefits from a legal framework with the tests authorised under the REACH regulation. It is therefore urgent to extend the problem further to animal testing in general. One example is that almost a year ago, a cosmetic brand, which voted against animal testing, yielded to pressure from an Asian market by allowing animal testing in that country.

I was particularly struck by one of our own farm safety specialists in Ireland, and I’ll read again the heading of an article which he contributed to where he said ‘Europe is being fed on the lives of 1,000 farmers every single year’, and he was angry because he also added that in Europe we know how many calves are born, we know about their welfare but we cannot tell how many farmers are killed every year, and he described that as a disgrace and I agree with him. It is true that far too many people on farms in my country and across the European Union are killed while going about their daily lives. It’s also true that many suffer terrible accidents on farms – children, men and women. It is a silent and hidden problem and it’s something that we need to lift the lid on. So I hope that this debate this evening is a start in that process. Commissioner we need a clear picture of what’s happening on all farms across Europe. I spoke about my own Member State, and the situation there is not good, but we don’t know with any great accuracy the level of fatalities and accidents. We hear anecdotal stories, but we need the facts and we need to ask why this is happening. Is there relentless pressure on farmers today that perhaps is intensified because they are more isolated and farming alone more than in the past? Long hours, sleeplessness, physical activity when people are tired all add to the stresses and strains. I know that recently we’ve had terrible weather conditions in many countries and that affects the physical well-being of farmers and their mental well-being, and when people are tired and emotionally drained accidents do and will happen. But there is another question that I think we need to address here this evening. We all talk about the family farm. It’s a romantic notion and we defend it and we want to contribute to its survival and we hold it dear, but we need to ask ourselves is the combination of family and farm part of the problem? I’m not advocating that we move away from the family farm model, but I think we do need to ask the hard questions that by not separating the business and the family we may be creating more difficulties around accidents and fatalities – it is a question that we need to discuss. Farms are now more intensive, there are fewer people working on them, and therefore one of the things I’ve tried to do when we talk about getting the facts on this situation is to get details into one of the files we’re working on integrated farm statistics. I think there’s a lot of resistance among Council and Member States to actually work together to get accurate statistics, counting the same things, and I would have thought it’s an issue that there should be some unity on, so perhaps the Commission could help us in that regard. I want to talk also about well-being and health generally, because in my own Member State there are some very disturbing figures around the high incidence of occupational injury and disease amongst farmers. They are a very high-risk group for lifestyle diseases and yet the image of farmers is that they work outdoors, it’s fresh air and it’s healthy, while in fact the reality for many farmers is that their health is not good and indeed in the research that I’ve looked at from the Irish researchers shows that farmers in my country have significantly higher mortality rates from cardiovascular disease, cancers and other causes of death compared with other occupational groups. So again those statistics are anything but comforting. When I talk to you about the pressures farmers are under – and Commissioner you know we talked about the European budget today, so it’s not a night to discuss it in detail – farmers will be anxious about pressures on their budgets. They will welcome your attempt to tackle unfair trading practices. I dare say there are many farmers who are looking at this massive merger that’s happening in the United Kingdom between Asda and Sainsbury’s and saying to themselves, ‘well that’s something to look forward to!’ This is part of the relentless pressure farmers are under: that massive merger will put some people ‘in the money’, as the gentleman sang when he was being interviewed, but it would be very bad for suppliers who expect to see a 10% cut in the prices they get. There is a link in all of this. You can push people very far and too far, and in my view the pressures in the food supply chain heap back on the producers and on farmers, that’s why we have the horror story of accidents and fatalities, and something’s got to be done about it.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 1, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 1, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 312, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Phil Hogan", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, as you know I am taking this point on behalf of my colleague, Commissioner Thyssen. I am happy to do so because both Vice-President McGuinness and I are, unfortunately, only too familiar with the issue of farm safety and the devastating effect that loss of life and life-changing injuries can have on victims and their families. Before I deal with that issue, Ms McGuinness mentioned the announcement today of the budget. This was a proposal that has been in gestation for a considerable period of time and I think that the announcement today is certainly a very good attempt to mitigate the worst effects of what may have been proposed some months ago in relation to the budget. Organisations like Farm Europe were saying that there is a cut of 15% in the CAP budget, when it is actually 5%. It should be seen for what it is, fake news. We are all aware that farmers have to work in all weathers and all conditions. This year’s long winter and frequent storms have heightened the risk to farmers working in poor light and unsafe conditions. Commissioner Thyssen and I share your concerns that the number of accidents and fatalities on European farms is far too high. Indeed, in 2015, there were more than 500 fatal accidents in agriculture, forestry and fishing. This is nearly six fatal cases per 100 000 persons employed in these sectors, and this is precisely why the protection of occupational safety and health of workers, including farmers and others working in the agricultural sector, remains a high priority for this Commission. In this respect, the European Pillar of Social Rights emphasised the right of workers to a healthy, safe and well-adapted work environment. Over the years, the EU has developed a comprehensive acquis on Occupational Safety and Health (OSH), which applies to all economic sectors, including agriculture. For example, according to the EU directives, the employers have the obligation to determine and assess the risks of hazardous chemical agents used on farms, such as pesticides, cleaning agents, veterinary medicines, fuels and oils, and the risks related to whole-body vibrations when driving tractors. They also have the obligation to provide, if necessary, personal protective equipment, free of charge. The available data on accidents at work show that the application of the acquis on OSH has contributed to improving workers’ protection in the EU, including in the agricultural sector. For example, the number of fatal accidents in farming decreased by nearly a quarter between 2008 and 2015, in the EU28. This means 100 fatal cases less, albeit it’s still a very big number, and any death is a tragedy for their family and the statistics do not show that. Applying health and safety regulations is also beneficial for businesses. Studies show that the employer may have a double return on every euro spent on OSH. At the same time, we are conscious that implementing the EU health and safety rules would be something of a challenge for farmers and small enterprises in the agricultural sector. I also take note of the concern of Ms McGuinness that there might be an unacceptable level of farm accidents on farms with low incomes. Although there is no evidence to confirm this link at this stage, it is a point that is worth taking into account. We do know that there is a particular risk to part-time farmers who often have to check their stock when they come home from work and often in poor conditions. Our main priority is to help farmers and SMEs to meet their obligations under the EU acquis. I am aware that around one-third of the workforce in the farming sector is self-employed, including farmers, and that the EU OSH Directives are not applicable to them. This is why it is important that Member States take measures at national level to promote the safety and health of self-employed workers. I note with great interest your question as to whether we would propose to fund farm safety schemes in the context of the next CAP reform. The CAP is not necessarily the framework for setting rules on working conditions or occupational health and safety at work. I would be more than happy to see the CAP used to encourage greater farm safety and I am certainly open to any ideas on how the CAP could be a positive driver of change in this area. The second pillar of the CAP provides for on-farm investment which could be used for farm safety measures. Vice-President McGuinness will be aware, and other Members will also be interested to know, that the Irish Department of Agriculture included a farm safety scheme as part of its Targeted Agricultural Modernisation Scheme (TAMS, as we call it) under the Rural Development Programme. The objective was to improve the standard of safety on Irish farms by providing grant aid for a number of specified investments. Farmers could apply for grant aid of up to EUR 8000 per holding. As I said, and reflecting Commissioner Thyssen’s concern, the occupational safety and health of all EU workers, including farm safety across the EU, is a priority. In this sense, the 2017 Commission Communication on Safer and Healthier Work for All clearly indicates our key actions for improving and modernisation of our occupational safety and health legislation and policy: firstly, fighting occupational cancer, and this is relevant for the agricultural sector as well, in particular the updates to the Carcinogens and Mutagens Directive; secondly, supporting SMEs in complying with rules for occupational health and safety and, again, this applies to farms; and thirdly, ensuring better enforcement of the rules. These three actions aim at improving the safety and health of workers in the agricultural sector. Last, but not least, I would like to stress the importance of further developing the monitoring tools, as evidence-based policies require high quality, comparability and, as Ms McGuinness said, timely data. We need to get the Member States to give us more data in order to have a more coordinated approach at EU level on how we can tackle this issue. For that, we need to work closely with our Member States and our social partners to develop the tools and to improve the quality of the data.

Thus, according to Eurostat, more than 500 fatal accidents occurred in agriculture, forestry and fishing alone in 2015, which I find very serious. The performance of these activities in sometimes difficult to reach areas, in open spaces, in winds or in the heat of the sun limits the possibilities of intervention by specialist crews in case of need or in the event of accidents. Time factor, lack of qualified human resources and financial pressures cause farmers to intensify their activities, which very easily creates the premises for unacceptable accidents. Solitary work, lack of protective equipment, fatigue and stress are risk factors to which workers in these fields are exposed daily. To all this is added the lack of awareness, training and psychological counseling programs, as well as information on risks. Often, the life and health of those who provide for many banal liter of milk or kilogram of meat times of cheese are endangered by the extremely complex work on a farm. On the basis of these realities, the European Commission and the Member States must immediately start procedures to combat this phenomenon.

On this point, Commissioner, we must accompany the transition through dedicated means and abandon the use of these products of which farmers are the first victims as soon as possible. The second cause of death among farmers — and I would like, if I may, to take advantage of this debate to come back to this point — is suicide. This is the socio-professional category most at risk in this regard. Suicide excess mortality among farmers is 20 to 30 times higher than the population average. In France, a farmer's suicide is recorded every other day. In the last two years, nearly 300 farmers have died in my country. The lack of income and cash flow, often linked to malfunctioning markets, affects the psychological state of our farmers who are only asking to live from their jobs.

I think it is very timely and very good that we are debating this today, because for many, when an accident occurs on the farm, it leaves very long-term consequences and very sad families after it.  I have to say there is no easy solution to many of the problems that arise, but also, many are avoidable. Many of them actually happen during times when pressure is on, and the pressure can be on the farmer at times when he has to sow the seed, harvest the crops, do the ploughing, spread the slurry. That is when sometimes caution is thrown to the wind and that is when some mistakes happen. Where I come from in Northern Ireland we have a Stop and Think safety policy, and that is fine and good, but I believe we could do more. I think maybe the Commissioner might want to take this on board because when finance is short, corners are cut, and that is also a danger, so I think we should look maybe at Pillar 2 to see how we can actually give some help to this particular area, especially in slurry-related accidents which have been very prevalent in my region. I take Mr Andrieu’s point, and the suicide levels as well. These are all extremely worrying to people who work in farming. And the food supply chain – by continually pushing for margin reduction – has to ask how much more can they achieve.

The psychological stress is also increasing enormously in agriculture. And what do we do about it? We have indeed prepared a good prevention system with our social security institutions: we have prevention courses, we have partnership advice, more than 160 000 farm visits are held on site, and we have also created safety days for children in cooperation with farm women's work. All these are the things we desperately need. The most important thing is to enlighten and create good offers here. What can the EU level do? Perhaps we should actually query operational reliability in the multiple application. Unfortunately, animal welfare has a higher standard than human welfare. We could integrate that here. We have had EU guidelines on machinery safety since 2006. However, the agricultural machinery manufacturers are not strongly informed that this must also be brought in there.

The obverse of this though is a recklessness in undertaking activities that could result in death or serious injury. The thought process is ‘I know what I’m doing, I have done it before, and it’s not going to affect anybody else’, and I have been guilty of this attitude personally – despite knowing two people who died in farm accidents, and two more who lost limbs. I’ve had some near misses myself, getting away with minor injuries instead. I see here a similarity with the attitude to drinking and driving held by most of my peer group in my youth. Over the years, social pressure has changed this attitude quite significantly, and social pressure could play a part in reducing farm accidents. For a self-employed, one—man—band farmer, the onus of this social pressure falls on his immediate family. Using the right psychology, a great deal could be achieved here. A family discussion about inviting a health and safety officer to come and visit the farm for a chat would send a very powerful message. Changing attitudes is the key to reducing most farm accidents, but money can play a part as well. The second highest cause of farm fatalities, with vehicle incidents as the first, is contact with aggressive livestock. If all cattle farms possessed top—of—the—range mobile handling and restraining equipment, I think farmers would use it. If a Pillar 2 grant was available to finance it and Member States brought in punitive penalties for failing to use it, then farmers would use it.

The Members have made sincere interventions in relation to this report, which I think we will find very useful. I think I can conclude from the debate that we all share the same concerns for the occupational safety and health of all our EU workers, including our farmers and others working in the agricultural sector. And of course, as Mr Nicholson mentioned, income pressure, weather, all the risks associated with agriculture, contribute at various times towards putting additional pressure on our farmers and therefore it requires more care and attention in terms of how they farm and how they go about their business. As far as the Commission is concerned, we will continue to focus on the actions that we mentioned in the 2017 Occupational Safety and Health Communication, which includes the updated carcinogens directive. We will also continue to work closely with the Member States to support them in line with what Madam Grapini said – and I agree that the European Commission cannot do everything in relation to the rules and enforcement of trying to assist our farmers to actually farm more safely. That is not what has been said by most people with the exception of one speaker, Mr Colombier. The Member States and ourselves need to coordinate better, provide additional supports, and those supports are available under the pillar 2 at the moment – under the targeted measures that I mentioned under pillar 2 – but not every Member State programmes them. And perhaps in the legislative proposal that we are discussing at the moment, we could include this as a mandatory reason for the Member States to include in their strategic plan the need to look at the issue of farm safety in pillar 2. This may help to concentrate the minds of Member States in relation to the measures they need to propose to deal with this issue and the training that is required, as mentioned by Mr Agnew and others, in order to assist our farmers to be able to cope better and to understand better the need to not take the short cuts that they often do at times of pressure.

Data on the consumption of sheep and goats are not much more encouraging, because in 2001 the average consumption was 3.5 kilograms per person, while in the last year the average was only 2 kilograms, with the young population having reduced their consumption the most. The report that I am presenting to you today and for which you have the honour of being the rapporteur highlights this situation and proposes a series of measures with which to try to reverse this negative trend. Undoubtedly a key element of the report is the recognition of the very important environmental work carried out by the sheep and, above all, goats, especially in its extensive modality, in terms of preserving biodiversity in many European regions. This contribution of public goods should be duly rewarded by the establishment of an environmental payment. This has been my main concern, and I am particularly pleased that it appears on the first point of this document, which we will be voting tomorrow. The report highlights the need to look for ways to improve the marketing of products from the sheep and goats sectors, by promoting consumption, especially in younger populations, and also encouraging new presentation formulas at points of sale that are more adapted to current consumption habits. Attacks on herds by large predators have been the subject that has aroused the most debate within the Committee on Agriculture because of the growing losses suffered by farmers, who are in a situation of clear helplessness in the face of this phenomenon. The increase in the populations of wolves, lynx, bears and other predators, as a result of the protection measures we have already introduced in the European Union, seems to have no limits and is increasingly becoming a major concern for European farmers. This report calls for the introduction, as I would say, certain elements of the Habitats Directive in a timely manner, with the aim of controlling and managing the excessive proliferation of predators, which has been observed in many European grazing areas. However, we do not intend to produce a complete revision of the Directive. Parliament also asked in this report that, in the negotiation of trade agreements with third countries, these sectors — sheep and goats — be considered as sensitive sectors. This demand is particularly relevant in the current negotiations with Australia and New Zealand. It would be appropriate to expect a study of the impact that Brexit is going to have on the European market, since about 48% of the current 287 000 tonnes quota benefiting New Zealand and 75% of the 19200 tonne quota granted to Australia are destined directly to the United Kingdom. The Commission should clearly maintain caution in negotiating these new agreements. In this regard, the European Parliament adopted its opinion on this issue in October last year, considering sheepmeat as a particularly sensitive element in these negotiations. Finally, I would like to tell you that, in global terms, this report is very positive for the sector, so I hope it will not have any problems tomorrow to be approved by a large majority in this House. I would also like to convey a strong message of support to livestock farmers and to thank the Commissioner for his sensitivity to this sector during this term.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 334, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Daniel BUDA", "mepid": "125012", "text": "— Mr President, the development of the sheep and goat sector is an essential link in sustainable and efficient agriculture.

You shouldn’t be looking at Farm Europe on the website because they are giving you the wrong information. I look forward to France being very strong supporters of getting Member States, particularly Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden and Austria in unanimity in order to do more, so that we can reduce this particular impact on our farmers. I look forward to the leadership of France in this regard. Mr President, I want to thank the rapporteur, Ms Herranz García, for her report on the sheep and goat sector. This report rightly highlights the very specific features that are associated with this type of farming in the EU. Recognising the contribution of the sheep sector as well as its vulnerability, I established a sheepmeat forum in the autumn of 2015 to provide our stakeholders, together with my services, with the opportunity to discuss the challenges and opportunities that face the sector. Ms Herranz García’s report is another valuable contribution to the discussion about this important sector. The Commission shares the rapporteur’s view in regard to the importance of small ruminants, not only for producing a whole range of market goods like meat, milk, wool and skins, but also in relation to landscape conservation, the fight against countryside desertification and the preservation of our cultural heritage. Maintaining current production levels in sensitive sectors is one of the reasons why the CAP foresees the possibility for Member States to provide voluntary coupled support for the sheep sector. The report’s suggestion to increase this level of support has to be seen in the context of the proposals for the future CAP. Promotion is a key element for a product like sheepmeat that is comparatively more expensive than others. I have therefore decided that sustainable sheep and goat production is a priority for the 2018 Annual Work Programme of EU promotion for agricultural products and I have allocated EUR 2 million for national programmes and EUR 4 million for multi-Member State programmes, and these figures have been ring-fenced for promotion campaigns on the internal market, on the sustainable aspects of sheepmeat production. In an effort to improve market transparency, the Commission has established a dedicated sheep and goatmeat dashboard, which is published on its website. This gives regular market updates and provides stakeholders with information about the main market developments inside and outside the EU. Strengthening the farmers’ position in the food chain is also important. Since January 2018 the sector can benefit from new rules on producer cooperation that are contained in the Omnibus Regulation, but they also relate to public goods. The Omnibus has also played its part here in changing the definition in terms of permanent grassland and this will help some countries, in particular Spain, Portugal, Italy, Greece and the south of France. Unfair trading practices, of course, are also impactful on the meat sector, particularly the sheepmeat sector where operators are operating in a highly fragmented sector, such as this one. The Commission appreciates that the potential of the sheep sector could be heavily impacted by Brexit. In the sheep sector the UK plays a central role as a producer and also as an importer and in intra-European Union trade. The European Union and the UK, as Ms McGuinness has asked, have recently presented a proposal to the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to allow for the proportionality of the Tariff Rate Quotas (TRQs) to be shared out in line with what they are today. The first countries that actually objected to this were the United States, Australia and New Zealand, and these are supposed to be the best friends of the United Kingdom when it comes to a future trading relationship. If you have friends like that, it’s not easy to resolve these issues in relation to tariff rate quotas. Ms Herranz García’s report highlights the importance of the sheep and goat sector as a provider of public goods. Supporting it is in the interest of all of us.

It also discusses the dangers facing the sector: Brexit with future New Zealand and Australian tariff quotas, and more broadly trade agreements on the one hand, and the issue of health and predator proliferation, which is increasing pressure on herds and our livestock producers on the other.

The scandal reinforces us even more in our regard: to defend and encourage the independence and pluralism of information, both on paper and online, and not to multiply the means of controlling it or even repress her. This is why we were cautious in dealing with the subject of fake news — remembering that these are not born with the Internet: they are, in my opinion, the fruit of group behavior, the so-called groupthink — that they plague and have plagued mainstream communication as well as online. The notion of fake news, as is written in the report, should not be used to exclude or criminalize critical voices. Internet misinformation has a viral and offensive nature that should not be underestimated and it is true that few giants of the Internet, outside the Union — Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft — wield power immense, control and selection of news, surveillance and user profiling. But censorship, especially if it is entrusted to the giants themselves, cannot be the answer. At the moment, the most serious analyses agree that neither fake news nor psychographic profiling of users, nor Cambridge Analytica — now finally closed — determined the outcome of the election American or French or the Brexit referendum. Accusing the algorithm is too convenient a loophole to avoid analyzing an election result. Removing the most dangerous content from the Internet, especially in cases of child pornography and terrorism, is an often necessary solution, but it cannot be entrusted to private companies, nor can it neglect the three principles of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: necessity, proportionality, legitimacy. We asked that judging be independent bodies that at the same time ensure net neutrality and the protection of personal data. Still for the same reason, we express concern about libel laws, emphasizing the crippling effects they may have on the right to branch and receive information. At the same time, we recalled the key role of whistleblowers in safeguarding investigative journalism. In this framework we paid tribute to those who, as a journalist, paid their independence with their lives: to Daphne Caruana Galizia as to Ján Kuciak. The economic crisis, combining with the rise of online communication, has severely hit a key craft in democracies. The fourth power is now impoverished and the conditions of the investigator are so precarious that we can no longer really speak of an independent power, capable of avoiding self-censorship and dependence on others political, financial or advertising powers.

On her behalf I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms Spinelli, as well as the shadow rapporteurs for drafting a report on such a very important topic. Media freedom and pluralism are pillars of modern democracies and prerequisites for an open and free democratic debate. They are also fundamental rights enshrined in Article 11(2) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. We have seen that unfortunately the European Union is not immune from risks to media, freedom and pluralism. Recently two journalists were killed in the European Union for simply doing their job. These crimes have left the whole European Community deeply shocked and we must do our utmost to ensure that such tragic events do not happen. Last week Reporters Without Borders published its yearly Press Freedom Index, confirming the worrying trend that media freedom and pluralism is deteriorating in several EU Member States. While it is for Member States to guarantee media freedom and pluralism, the Commission is taking a number of measures to strengthen media freedom across the European Union within its competences. In legislative terms, it is likely that, once adopted, the revised audiovisual media services directive will include new provisions on the independence of regulators, on media literacy and on transparency of media ownership. All of these provisions are expected to have positive spillovers on the media environment within the European Union. I welcome the political agreement of the co-legislators achieved last week in this House. On the 23 April the Commission proposed new rules for the protection of whistle-blowers who are often valuable sources of information for journalists. Protecting them is therefore crucial for safeguarding the watchdog role of investigative journalism. Beyond the legislation, the Commission also acts as a facilitator. With the help of the European Parliament we fund independent projects which support journalists under threat, promote cross-border investigative journalism and provide financial support to the media freedom community. One of our main projects is the Media Pluralism Monitor. It is run by the University Institute of Florence and allows us to have an independent and in-depth analysis of the changing media landscapes in all the EU Member States. Others, such as the Index On Censorship or the International Press Institute, map and report violations of media freedom or provide legal support to journalists. We also need to counter the increase in polarisation and disinformation in online media and the resulting distortion of the democratic debate. Last week the Commission set forth its policy on this question, building on the results of the various consultations. The policy reflects the Commission’s commitment to improving European citizens’ access to unbiased, quality information online. This comprehensive approach to tackle disinformation seeks to be both inclusive and action-oriented in order to aid stakeholders to take immediate actions from July, to achieve a speedy reduction in the volume of online disinformation. I thank the European Parliament again for the high quality of this report and for the insightful views expressed by the Members. The Commission has only limited competence in the area of media freedom and pluralism, but it does however not turn a blind eye to the challenges of media freedom and pluralism and will continue to follow the situation in the Member States carefully. There is no doubt that Europe needs a strong, competitive, free and pluralistic media sector. Quality journalism and free media are the watchdogs of our societies. We must all collaborate to uphold and strengthen media freedom and pluralism, values that keep our democracies healthy and vibrant. In order to achieve this, there is still a lot of work to be done and it is very encouraging to see that all of us here share a common vision on these values we hold dear.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 361, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Ioan Mircea PAŞCU", "mepid": "33984", "text": "The debate has been closed.

It can be implemented both by raising awareness and critical thinking of the media workers themselves, as well as the public itself, by checking sources of information, etc. By accepting the position of the drafters that pluralism is inseparable from democracy and freedom, and the right to inform is one of the fundamental rights and freedoms, I believe that the strengthening of the independent media is necessary. In cooperation with media content creators, we must jointly create levers that allow all participants in the digital space to ensure the reliability of content and the impartiality of information. As guardians of the treaties, the European Commission plays an important role not only in ensuring the monitoring of media freedom in EU Member States, but also in shaping the highest criteria to ensure both media freedom and fundamental protection of human privacy and human dignity principles.", "language": "en", "original_language": "lt", "translation_provider": "aws", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 370, "date": "2018-05-02.json", "name": "Claudia ȚAPARDEL", "mepid": "124793", "text": "  in writing. – The freedom of expression and information, media freedom and pluralism are fundamental values to the architecture of freedoms and human rights, enshrined in the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and in the European Convention of Human Rights.

It is going beyond competences and approving opinions, challenges and recommendations in areas falling within the competence of the Member States. In some committees, it is slowly impossible for me and some of my colleagues to vote in favour of initiative reports because they contain ideological requirements and recommendations on marriage law and family policy, health policy and moral-ethical issues that are within the exclusive competence of Member States.

I wanted to talk about cohesion policy today. The proposal for a multiannual financial framework has been published today, and the cohesion policy does not come out entirely well. That's a finding of fact. In doing so, this policy should really be the heart of the European Union, their policies, because it eliminates disadvantage, reduces differences between regions, so I would like to burn for its strengthening and I would like to fire for its strengthening, primarily on the grounds that we have very dramatically depopulated rural areas and internal peripherals within the European Union. Europe functions as a sure funnel that sucks people, potential into its midst, leaving empty seats in its wake. Therefore, we should support mainly rural areas under agricultural and cohesion policies. It's a significant problem, 80% of Europe's population will live in Europe's biggest cities within ten years.
