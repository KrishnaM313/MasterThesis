Et voilà, à peine deux semaines plus tard, nous sommes ici devant vous avec notre proposition pour un pacte vert pour l’Europe, the European Green Deal. Ce sont les peuples d’Europe qui nous ont appelés à une action décisive contre le changement climatique. Les Européens ont fait entendre leur voix dans les rues et dans les urnes. C’est pour eux que nous sommes ici aujourd’hui, c’est pour eux que nous présentons un pacte vert pour l’Europe aussi ambitieux. C’est aujourd’hui que nous leur disons: nous vous avons entendus, nous vous avons entendus clair et fort et voici la réponse. Chers parlementaires, en juillet, immédiatement après ma nomination, j’ai placé l’action climatique au cœur de mon programme politique. Par votre vote, vous avez approuvé ce programme et je vous ai promis que vous auriez une place centrale dans les prochaines étapes. Aujourd’hui, Frans et moi, ainsi que tout le collège, nous présentons, à vous et aux citoyens européens, nos idées pour le pacte vert de l’Europe. Nous sommes aussi ici parce que nous avons besoin de vous. Cette proposition n’est pas le point final d’un travail, c’est le début d’un chemin commun et nous ne progresserons qu’avec votre soutien. Honourable Members, this is not just our vision for a climate-neutral continent; it is a roadmap for action, with 50 practical steps on Europe’s path towards 2050. It will take more than a generation to reach that goal. We know that this roadmap will have to evolve and adapt through the years. It will be a very long and partly bumpy road, without any question, but it is up to us to set the pace. It is up to us to leave no one behind, and we know that it is doable. We are determined to succeed, for the sake of this planet and life on it. And so many European people, businesses and cities, are already showing us the way. Last Friday, 44 of Europe’s largest investors, representing EUR 6 trillion of assets, called on the European Union to adopt, as quickly as possible, a climate law for climate neutrality in 2050. They want that law. They say it will give them the confidence to make long-term decisions for modern investment. It is about accountability and reliability, and therefore a crucial building block of our European Green Deal will be, in 2020, the proposal of the very first European climate law. It will set clear rules so that investors and innovators can plan their long-term investment. It will make the transition towards climate neutrality accountable and reliable. Next summer we will present a plan to increase our ambition in cutting emissions. This decision on our 2030 target will not be left to chance. The plan will come with a thorough impact assessment to better understand where we can be bold, but also where we must be prudent. We want to be as ambitious as we can and we want to be as realistic as we can. All of this will be ready in time for next year’s COP26 in Glasgow. Europe will lead by example, but we also need more ambitious multilateral rules for the whole world. Of course, every continent has to find its own path, without any question, but the goal must be the same for everyone, and positive change must be rewarded and not hindered. We want to protect our planet. We welcome the change in production procedures. If companies invest in clean technologies, if they respect our environment, it can’t be that they face unfair competition from heavy polluters, and that’s when we will apply a carbon border adjustment mechanism with full compliance with WTO rules. (Applause) Honourable Members, the European Green deal is not only about emissions: it is about boosting innovation; it is about quality food; it is about modern mobility. It will create new businesses and markets all across Europe. The European Green Deal is our new growth strategy, and this time it’s a growth strategy that is not consuming, but it is a new growth strategy that is more giving back than it takes away. It’s a growth strategy that is more caring. Companies from all across our continent are already turning the green transition into green opportunities and business opportunities. Some are converting plastic waste in modern furniture, for example. Farmers are using data from our satellites to adapt to climate change. Made-in-Europe batteries for electric cars are finally becoming reality. We must invest in Europe’s potential for innovation. 70 years ago, Europeans invested in coal and steel, and it turned out to be a historic reconciliation and an economic miracle. Today we are investing in renewables and algorithms, and the European Green Deal is about reconciling our economy with our planet, reconciling the way we produce and the way we consume with our planet, and respecting the environment we live in. That is the core of the European Green Deal. Honourable Members, exactly one year ago, the city of Katowice hosted the Global Climate Conference of COP24. This city, that for over a century was a capital of coal, became the global capital of climate action. Delegations from the whole world saw former coal industries that now host congress centres, restaurants and concert halls. This transition did not happen overnight, and it was certainly not effortless. Likewise, the European Green Deal won’t happen overnight and it will be demanding, but it is the right thing to do. As in Katowice, the transition will bring better and healthier jobs. It will bring cleaner and less-polluted cities. It will bring a higher quality of life for Europeans. But this transition will also need time, support and solidarity. Therefore, immediately in the next year, we will propose the Just Transition Mechanism. It will combine public money and private money. The European Investment Bank will leverage it, with the ambition to reach EUR 100 billion in investment over the next seven years. It will be the springboard for those sectors and those regions that have to catch up. Everyone in Europe can be part of this change. The transition is not just about big industry and coal. It is an opportunity for our farmers, with our farm-to-fork strategy. From Lapland to southern Italy, a whole generation of young farmers are rediscovering traditional crops and bringing new life to our countryside. The European Green Deal will be on their side. The European Green Deal will take care of Europe’s incredible natural heritage. It will protect biodiversity and revive the blue economy. But we, as institutions that serve the Europeans, must also walk the talk, and this is what the European Commission will do. We also have to learn what this change means in our daily life – how to practice sustainability. What does it mean for our buildings, for our waste management, for our travels, for our paper use, you name it? Today in College, we set ourselves the target to be, as a Commission, climate neutral by 2030, and I invite Parliament and the Council to do the same. It’s a challenge, but let’s do that together. Let us support active citizenship and call on grass roots initiatives. Let us work with teachers and educators, because our children are not passive spectators. They are very active players in this endeavour. Our climate pact will be with them and for them and for all those who are ready to play a part in this endeavour. Honourable Members, a whole continent has to be mobilised, from mayors in small cities and in big cities to all institutions on the European level. Every member of my Commission will be involved, every Member State, every committee in this Parliament. In fact, none of this will be possible without your support. We will need ambitious legislation. We will need a seven-year budget that rises to the challenge. Today, we bring the European Green Deal here to the floor of Parliament. Tomorrow I will present it to our leaders in the Council, and later this week Mr Timmermans will present it to COP25 in Madrid. Let’s start this endeavour together. Honourable Members, some say the cost of this transformation is too high. Well, let us never forget what the cost of non-action would be. (Applause) It is rising by the year. River flooding costs our citizens over EUR 5 billion annually. Every year, our economy is losing almost EUR 10 billion due to droughts, and farmers pay the highest price. And this is only the beginning. But this is not a given. We can resist these developments. It is high time, but it is not too late. With this roadmap for action, we make the cost of the transition fully sustainable. Many Europeans are already taking action. Only one year ago, no one would have imagined that millions would take to the street for climate. Our cities are choosing clean energy. Our scientists are developing the technologies of the future. Our families are renouncing plastic and choosing local food. Our European Green Deal is for them. It is ambitious. It is designed to be just. It is made in Europe for Europe to lead the way to climate neutrality in 2050. Europe has always given its best when it has worked together as a Union. We give our best when we are bold and aim high, and with the European Green Deal we are aiming high. Europeans are calling on us to drive the change. Now it’s up to us to answer their call.

And for the EPP, for us popular parties and Christian Democrats, our motivation is crystal clear: we believe that we don’t own this planet; we’re merely looking after it for the generations to come, and we therefore simply have a moral obligation to protect it. And for us, what we discussed today, therefore, is not just a deal; it’s a solemn promise that we make to our children and our grandchildren. The President of the European Commission earlier today talked about a ‘man-on-the-moon’ moment, and she is right, because aiming for something that is so hard to reach takes a lot of courage. But we simply need to act; we may be the last generation that can still act and have an impact and make a difference. We only simply have a couple of decades left. And at the same time, for the EPP it is also clear that you don’t put a man – or a woman, for that matter – on the moon by just banning things, by increasing taxes and by telling people what they must do or what they can no longer do. We do it by bringing the best and the brightest together – that first of all. We need ground-breaking research: the smartest solutions and the cleanest industry which will provide jobs for Europeans and opportunities. Let Europe be the continent that develops and produces alternative aircraft fuels while also improving the rail market for shorter distances. Let Europe be the continent where we produce CO2-low or even -free steel. We in the EPP might not be climate warriors, but we are – and we need to be – climate nerds. That is what Europe needs to get ahead. We do it, secondly, by leaving nobody behind, it has been said; by not putting the burden, for example, on those who can least afford it. And this is a real worry among Europeans. We do it by working with our farmers and foresters: farmland and forests take up more than three quarters of our surface in Europe, and some brand farmers and foresters as the villains, as the problem in this debate, whereas they’re part of the solution. And we should help them, starting by ensuring them a fair price for their products as well as an international level playing field. And thirdly, we do it by bringing by being coherent and consistent. For the EPP it is clear that an ambitious climate policy and a smart industrial policy need to go hand in hand. A Green Deal without a good deal for our industry will not deliver the change that we are looking for. We want and we need ambition with the business case. And finally, we need a global, level playing field, it has been said, ensuring that other parts of the world either play along or cannot have uncorrected access to the European market. Today is a day, I think, for firmly putting that dot on the horizon. We agree on the direction that we are heading in. We share an ambition. But the work on how we get there is only starting. Let’s not fool ourselves. It will be challenging, and what we need is a combination of real vision and practical strategy, and this is what the EPP can and will deliver.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2019-12-11.json", "name": "Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr. President. Madam President, today we have the opportunity to us us with a new era. For Europe and for our planet. Just eleven days after the start of the mandate, the European Commission, thanks to the extraordinary work of Frans Timmermans, presents us with more than just a proposal. What is presented to us today is a new model of growth, which aims to transform the European Union into a fairer and more prosperous society capable of responding to the challenges of climate change. Last November this Parliament declared the climate emergency. For the Social Democrats, this is not an empty slogan. This is a warning that requires urgent and exceptional action. The Green Pact points to the path that Europe and the rest of the world need to take for their transformation. It represents a total paradigm shift to definitively bury fossil fuels and achieve a climate-neutral Europe by 2050. If we are to achieve these objectives through a fair transition, we must rely on three pillars. The first is a green pillar, implementing the United Nations 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals. In this regard, we welcome the fact that the proposal makes our old aspiration to incorporate the Sustainable Development Goals into the European Semester a reality. And I am also referring to this green pillar because it incorporates climate law with clear objectives and the ultimate commitment to achieving climate neutrality. The second pillar is the red pillar, the social dimension of the Green Pact. Within the Green Pact we need a real social dimension. We only do this with a strong social pillar that allows us to transform our economies and ensure that no one is left behind. Disadvantaged classes cannot be most affected by climate change. And the third pillar, the financial pillar. This pillar will determine the success of the Green Pact. According to the Commission, meeting its objectives will require an additional annual investment of EUR 260 billion. To do this, we need the multiannual financial framework with at least 1.3% of gross national income and we need to talk about fair taxation, aligned with carbon reduction targets. The European Union cannot fight climate change alone. Our trade policy is an excellent opportunity to promote our labour, social and environmental standards.

If we go this way, Renew Europe will be a trustworthy but also a demanding partner. We led the declaration of a climate emergency and demanded the Green Deal be placed at the top of the agenda. If we want the Green Deal to generate opportunities, we must avoid adding bureaucracy to bureaucracy. The Green Deal must not end up with new red tape but with a new societal dynamic. We need to go fast, but we also need to engage in a wide debate all across Europe and mobilise around this project. First, to trigger change, we need to set the level of ambition in our future climate law and to set impact assessment as the standard. Second, let’s face it, the transition toward a carbon—neutral economy is, and will be, a challenge for many of our economic sectors and workers. It will call for massive investment, creativity and solidarity with the people and the sectors confronted with the most challenging transformations. Third, a twofold approach to Green digitalisation and technology is fundamental for us. Digital technologies are uniquely positioned to provide effective tools for climate-change mitigation and adaptation. And fourth, we should not oppose traditional policies and new priorities but modernise our traditional tools. Both the cohesion policy and the common agricultural policy can deliver on our new political ambitions. The Green Deal ambition must be integrated with policy reforms that are already on the table. Dear colleagues, this ascent ahead of us is the challenge of a generation. But with determination and teamwork, our journey can be an opportunity for our renewal and reinvention.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are delighted that the new Commission has made the ecological issue one of the major projects of the legislature and that your first political act is the presentation of a European green pact. Two weeks after you take office, it is normal that this plan is, at this stage, schematic. The question now is whether and how this catalogue of commitment and good intentions will be translated into concrete action. For us four criteria will determine our commitment to the Green New Deal. Firstly, it will have to ensure that the European Union takes its full part in the fight to limit global warming to one and a half degrees. So far, not only are the Union's commitments insufficient, but they are not being kept. Fixing the situation requires that, in the next 100 days, we commit to reducing our emissions by 65% by 2030. And climate change is just one symptom of humanity's failure to respect the planet's biophysical limits. We must also act without delay on biodiversity, on the subject of resource depletion or on the pollution of nature, a nature on which we simply depend for our lives. Secondly, to succeed, the ecological transition must be in solidarity, it must go hand in hand with a drastic reduction in economic and social inequalities. It goes without saying that producing and consuming sustainably is more expensive financially. To place the bulk of the transition price on those who suffer poverty, precariousness and downgrading is simply intolerable. The yellow vests rightly reminded us of it. Similarly, if this transition is rich in jobs, it will also destroy jobs. Those who occupy them will have to benefit from the solidarity of all and it is to this, and exclusively to that, that the just transition fund must serve. There can be no question that it will be used to compensate shareholders who have decided to choose fossil fuels. In fact, this fund is only a small part of the answer to the just transition. What we need is a profound transformation of taxation, so that those who have made the profits from the fossil age are also those who pay the largest share of the transition price. Third, the Green Pact requires the coherence of all public policies. For example, what is the point of devoting a part of the European Union's budgets to the fight against climate change if the other part aggravates the problem? Similarly, the Green Pact requires a profound overhaul of a common agricultural policy that remains productive and oriented towards the satisfaction of world markets.  And what, then, of the Union's free-trade strategy? Increasing trade flows on the planet again and again is absolute nonsense. So, in terms of coherence, Madam President, your project raises the issue, identifies the contradictions, but keeps them a little too much, for my taste, to decide them clearly. Finally, fourth point: the Green Pact has no chance of success if we fail to put finance back at the service of society. Since the 2007-08 crisis, the predatory DNA of the financial sector, at the heart of the evils that the Green New Deal intends to combat, has remained largely unchanged. Worse, today, the general climate is more of a deregulation, which is totally irresponsible. Colleagues, it has been sixty years, sixty years since scientists first began to link human activities to climate change; half a century since the Club of Rome warned us of the deadly danger of unlimited economic growth; thirty years since the Rio summit, where Jacques Chirac told us: our house is burning and we are looking elsewhere; more than 20 years since the first UN climate conference, and our greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise as resources run out and biodiversity collapses. It is time to fight low because to generalise to the whole planet, Madam President, this famous European way of life that you want to promote would require four planets.

I mean, I don't say much, but at least have them an hour earlier and be able to read two sheets, but I don't. Clearly, democracy in this House is like this, it is a little inconvenient to give the opposition the opportunity to read the documents under discussion. I've heard of \"50 Steps through 2050,\" a dream book, cover ads. Environmental neutrality by 2050: but have you considered the social and economic impacts of this? I understand that the Commission needs to have a somewhat fashionable image, because it is not that you are really loved, but it does not seem to me that shooting slogans, or chasing the Greta of the moment, is the right way. He talked about promoting innovation and quality food. I wonder whether 'quality food' means what we have seen with nutriscore, or Tunisian oil, or African oranges. I say this because Europe and the countries of Europe are being asked for standards, and then we magically see that you also make trade agreements with countries that do not have these standards. The same applies to plastic: keep talking about plastic free and then make trade agreements with countries where pollution is the order of the day. I have heard of made in Europe batteries, but do you have in mind that today 70 % of all batteries in the world are made in China, Japan and Korea?  I then listened to the evolution that has taken place from coal to steel and now, in short, the ambition of electricity. I just asked myself: is it not the case that some countries want to convert the production system at the expense of all European citizens? Perhaps this is a doubt that has only come to us, but, in short, it seems quite obvious You have talked about a hundred billion investments over the next seven years and then you are the same ones looking at commas and demanding compliance with budgetary constraints on countries when they have to fix their hydrogeological failure. I say this, of course, because I come from Italy, but this must apply to all countries. Lastly, I have the impression that for the second time we have heard the Juncker plan, the one that told the multiplier effect, namely that we would put in a euro and gain 1 500 % more, but that was not the case.

First, we meet here in exceptional circumstances. We are discussing the sweeping changes to our climate and energy goals brought forward by the European Commission no sooner than 10 days since taking up office and before our recent, existing climate agreements have been implemented. This is ambitious, but it is not prudent. Point number two. In the ECR we had hoped the new Commission would be more cautious than the last one – that it would work with the Member States and within the Treaties. If you read the Treaty’s Article 15, it stated very clearly: it is the European Council who define the political direction of EU policies. And the European Council meets tomorrow to discuss: guess what? The EU’s long-term climate policy. So I ask myself: why are we here today? Is the Commission trying to seize the initiative, to take away power from the Member States? When we look back, we can see that in 2014 the European Council unanimously agreed the 2030 targets delivered with compromise after painstaking negotiations. And today’s headline goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050 should have followed the same path, and Member State governments should not be sidelined on something this fundamental. Point number three, Madam President. In recent months we have heard so much about the green wave sweeping Europe. But have you noticed that, when this wave reaches the Baltic and travels down the Danube, it is not even a ripple? Why? Because in Central and Eastern Europe we can see through it. We see a confused strategy that prompts more questions than it answers. Are the Commission’s new climate goals credible and achievable? And what will this do to our industries? You pictured some sort of a paradise – who wouldn’t like to live in a paradise? But will this convince millions of Europeans? How have the new Commission, in 10 days since taking office, been able to fully understand how dramatically our economies could change as a result of this Green Deal? Have you an idea of the social costs as well as personal tragedies it will generate? Point number four, which I wanted to omit, but I will just indicate it briefly. It’s about gas. We see a completely confused strategy here. Gas is going to be an essential part of decarbonising in the coming years, and new legislation agreed recently prohibits future investment in gas. This is certainly confusing. So to conclude, Madam President. How we move forward has to be credible and achievable, otherwise you can have all the talk and targets in the world, but they will count for nothing if you can’t actually meet them.

Mr President, Madam President, today's debate is not a debate like any other, we are talking about a fundamental issue that transcends partisan divides: the survival of human civilization as we know it. We welcome the European Commission's approach to presenting its action plan before us, but let us say it now, any climate initiative will be futile if it does not tackle the root of the problem: an economic system that leads to both the destruction of our ecosystem and the explosion of inequalities. So some of your proposals, such as reforestation, state aid or energy efficiency, are moving in the right direction, but your plan is limited to objectives that remain unclear, non-binding and unfunded. One sign is no mistake: in your plan, there are many action plans, strategies that are set out, but few real legislative changes, when we know very well that we will not save the planet with incantations. Your plan is also riddled with contradictions that are fundamental and render some of its objectives inoperative. On energy, how can we be credible without a precise timetable for the exit of coal and gas and by further expanding an inefficient carbon market? On trade, what are environmental clauses for, if we pursue climate free trade agreements? On agriculture, how can we increase the area dedicated to organic without re-opening the CAP negotiations? On transport, how can rail freight be developed by continuing the dismantling of state-owned enterprises? Finally, on financing, where are the concrete commitments for a kerosene tax, a carbon tax and a plastic tax? As it stands, this plan will not achieve your target of a 50% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, already below the efforts to comply with the Paris Agreement. Worse still, and most importantly for our group, this plan ignores the human and social dimension of the ecological transition, so even - and you yourself have acknowledged - that the most insecure are the first victims of the disaster and it is not the derisory just transition fund that will change the game. This is a major political fault: we will not solve the climate crisis against the peoples or by making them pay the highest price, as Emmanuel Macron tried to do in France. The ecological transition must be made by, for and with the peoples of Europe.  So, in the face of urgency, Europe needs a real green pact for Europe, social and ecological, on a scale not seen since the post-war period. This is the meaning of the counter-project of our group of the European Unitarian Left, which we are putting back to you today and which we are putting on the table: concrete proposals based on ten axes. Firstly, the Green Pact for Europe must set a binding priority target in a climate law: reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 70% by 2030, and must launch a major investment plan to plan the transition to 100% renewable energy by 2050 and impose binding energy-saving targets on businesses. It must also initiate a vast thermal and energy retrofit plan to lift the 125 million Europeans out of energy insecurity; it must revolutionize our agricultural policy by encouraging a peasant model; it must move away from the logic of free trade and dare to show solidarity protectionism; it must put the Central Bank at the service of the ecological transition; it must free up budgetary margins by freeing itself from the austere straitjacket and combating tax evasion. These are the outlines of the ecological and social plan that we are putting on the table today, this is what the peoples and the planet expect, finally a pact for happy days, a pact for the future. You have three months to go before the final publication of the European Union's strategy.

Firstly, it is important that the Commission now provides for impact assessments to increase the 40% CO2 reduction target. Secondly, the prerequisite for a transformation of the energy sector into renewables is the unrestricted acceptance of natural gas as a bridge technology. Not only do we need this as a base load, but we also need intact gas networks for the transformation of wind and solar energy into hydrogen-based solutions. Thirdly, we will have to have huge amounts of green import electricity. Negotiations with states predestined for the sun and wind must begin immediately. The European energy transition must become the most important part of Europe's neighbourhood and foreign policy.  Fourthly, the energy transition must be market-economy and technology-neutral. In terms of market economy, the proven ETS of industry should also be transferred to transport and buildings. Technology neutral means allowing innovation.

Gone are the days when Member States want to postpone and defer taking action.

All sectors need to contribute, and that includes shipping and aviation too. Fossil fuel subsidies should be phased out and stopped. We need policies that direct investments to cleaner technologies across the board and in all sectors. We require innovative ways to generate new money for these investments.

However, as a forma mentis, I believe that to improve one's needs to focus on the critical issues. Firstly, I wonder where we will find the money to finance what in all respects seems to be a re-run of the Juncker plan, given the sanctity of budgetary constraints. Furthermore, I would like to try to act as spokesman not for large investors, those who are able to mobilise trillions, but to speak on behalf of citizens and businesses that are deeply concerned about what the New Green Deal will be. These are the fears of those who fear that measures such as these should be reasoned in the long term and with the necessary planning, thus preventing them from being reduced to very expensive spots to satisfy public opinion or, worse still, to result in burdens that European companies, unlike those of third countries, will have to bear. For example, I am referring to Chinese pressure in the steel market. I wonder whether the New Green Deal will take responsibility for sanctioning China's non-compliance, or will it choose to ignore the stifling of our industry, as has been the case up to now. This is as if competitiveness is not one of the problems facing European companies most when faced with the aggressiveness of international competition. If there is a lack of competitiveness, market shares and jobs are lost as a result, and then it happens that companies delocaliise and paradoxically go to pollute in other countries. Thus, such a budgetary approach risks taking money from the next multiannual budget from key sectors, such as agriculture or cohesion policy. I doubt that the missing beneficiaries could go and say that their companies will close but will be able to enjoy lower carbon dioxide emissions.

The European Green Deal entered the race with three promises: the first was the reduction of emissions, the second the creation of jobs and the third the improvement of the quality of life. Reducing emissions is a noble approach. But the EU alone will not stop climate change – just 10% of global emissions are actually made in the EU. The commissioning of 300 new coal-fired power plants in China alone will make all the EU's hard and expensive savings obsolete. Whether the measures of the Green Deal will ultimately benefit the global climate is in the stars. What is certain at the moment, however, is above all one thing, namely the further strain and gearing of our citizens for energy and for transport. The massive cuts in the German and European car industry are also certain, with Nine and a half thousand jobs to be lost at Audi in my home town, for example, by 2025. So the EU is already heading for recession. With your Green Deal, you, Madam President of the Commission, are throwing a stick between the legs of an already stumbling woman.

This is the first time that, in our Assembly, all our economic and political choices will have to be subordinated to the science of complex living systems that is ecology. This leads me to remind you that the issue of climate change is not the only, or even the most important. The poisoning of soils, waters and air, the race at least maintained by free trade treaties, are also major problems, but we would like to point out that the extinction of the diversity of human societies, our common treasure, is probably an ecological problem even more important than the extinction of the diversity of animal and plant species. This leads us to remind us that a state in full possession of its territory is the only one capable of dealing with ecological emergencies. This also leads us to remind us that a nation that guarantees its borders, the identity and the unity of its people is also the only one capable of dealing with the ecological emergency and that, on the other hand, the family, the place of transmission of the responsibility of a territory, which we strive to transmit more beautiful, richer and more alive to future generations, is the only one capable of helping us to respond to ecological emergencies. All this leads us in the future to pay attention to several points, and first of all, to the point that regulatory capture biases do not disadvantage these SMEs which are the origin of the majority of activity in our territories, to the benefit of multinationals or globalist actors. This also leads us to be careful that behind the Green Pact for Europe is not the trap of uniformity of modes of doing, practices and modes of production, which would destroy our customs, our traditions and the singularity of the mores of our territories, which make the diversity of our societies and which, somewhere, somewhere , are a response to energy challenges. Finally, as a Frenchman, I can only stress our attention to the treatment of nuclear power. Civil and military nuclear power are totally linked, for us it is an energy of the future, but it is also, for us, the condition of France's strategic independence and perhaps the pillar of a Europe of defence.

This is a great start of what is going to be quite a bumpy road, where we will need both institutions to concentrate on all the elements that we need to make the Green Deal work. First of all, let me say here today that I want to congratulate Greta Thunberg for having been nominated Person of the Year by Time magazine. I think this is a great sign that this generation – our kids – are leading the way, and as a parent, there’s nothing more beautiful than when you see that your kids are leading the way. But that’s not the only reason why I believe we need to act now. The reason I believe we need to act now is because the facts are staring us in the face, and I think if you are a responsible Member of Parliament, if you’re in the responsible position in the Commission, if you’re a citizen, if you’re a parent, you do not have the luxury to ignore the facts. Look at what’s happening in Greenland. Look at what’s happening globally with our climate. Look at the desertification. Look at the erratic weather. Look at the people suffering because of this erratic weather across Europe. Look at what’s happening to our biodiversity as we speak. We do not have the luxury to ignore this any more. And look at another thing that’s happening. We are in the middle of the fourth industrial revolution. That is going to change our economy, our industry, whether we like it or not, whether we act or not. So the question we have to face today as Europeans is this: are we going to try and be masters of this momentous change, of this paradigm shift, or are we just going to let it happen, and then others will be the masters of it and we can just be the subjects of what others will decide? This is the fundamental question we have to answer, and the Green Deal is not a blueprint. It’s a roadmap. It’s an extended open hand to you and to all the stakeholders, whether it’s businesses, whether it’s NGOs, whether it’s trade unions, whether it’s citizens, whether it’s cities, whether it’s regions, to be part of a discussion of how we are going to reorganise our society in a just way so that it reflects the values we want to stand for. And we need to do this because Mother Earth is fed up with this behaviour. And you know, she was able to exist for millennia without human beings; she will be able to exist for other millennia without human beings. We’d better make sure we create an existence in balance with her so that we can continue to exist as human beings for millennia. And this is the responsibility we have before our kids. But let me make a point, because it was said often: this is costly. Yes, but don’t forget what the cost is of not acting. We see it every day. It was also said we have to be sure we take the right decisions. Yes, that is why every proposal the Commission is going to put on the table will be assessed for impact. Impact assessment will be an essential element of our analysis, but we will do this in a very, very speedy and comprehensive way. For instance. to determine exactly what the reduction by 2030 should be, from 50 to -55% – we want to have an impact assessment on that. But we want to be ready with that impact assessment early in the summer next year, so that the European Union is extremely well prepared, with a climate law for COP26 in Glasgow, so that we can lead the way. I bring back a message from Madrid – the COP, where I’m going to go back and present the Green Deal tomorrow. The message is this: we need European leadership. The message is also this: some of us are insecure about what we should do. But if Europe leads, we might go in the same direction. I had meetings with ministers from many countries saying: climate neutrality by 2050 is a good idea, we might do things the same way. With the Chinese we are in a debate. Are we going to have collective global leadership on this? Yes or no? We need to work on that, because if we do it together, the impact will be much bigger. But at the end of the day it is very important that this Parliament take this in hand and make sure that Parliament has a leading role, together with the Commission, to convince our Member States and Council to do the right thing. And if we begin by enshrining in law that by 2050 Europe will be climate neutral, then we can take steps back until today and just chart the map that we need to get there, and then we will discuss the measures we will need to take, whether it’s on ETS, whether it’s on emissions, whether it’s on taxation, whether it’s on all sorts of other measures to make our industry circular, to make sure that there are jobs in this new economy. But finally, I want to add one thing which is very, very important. You know, the biggest risk here I see is that those who are most vulnerable in climate change see themselves also as most vulnerable in the answer to climate change, so that they start resisting the Green Deal because they feel that they are vulnerable. And at the end of the day, if they resist the Green Deal and they stop it, they will be the first victims of the consequences of not doing the right thing. So that’s why – and this is a fundamental point – if this is not a social Green Deal, the Green Deal will not happen. If this is not a Green Deal where the most vulnerable regions in Europe – coalmining regions and others – do not see solidarity from other parts of Europe, it will not happen. So we need a level of solidarity with vulnerable individuals and vulnerable regions to make sure the Green Deal can be delivered for all our citizens. And let me end, because Mr Lange quoted ‘Man on the Moon’, so I obviously though of the famous moon speech by JFK, and let me just amend it slightly and end with that. We choose to go (to the moon in his case), we choose to go for climate neutrality in 2050 and do the other things, not because they are easy but because they are hard, because that goal will serve to organise and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win.

Factory farms produce staggering quantities of waste, pollute our land, air and water, and massively contribute to climate change. It is widely known that factory farming is an unsustainable method of raising animals – and one that is not compatible with the safe and wholesome food supply that the European Green Deal promised. Limiting the over-consumption of meat and dairy products is also essential to ward off climate crisis. Therefore, the absence of policies to stop industrial farming or to promote a shift towards plant-based diets is alarming. When designing a fair, healthy and environmentally friendly food system, the EU must tackle the over-consumption of meat and dairy products and factory farms.
