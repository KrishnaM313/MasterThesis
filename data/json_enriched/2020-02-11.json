In order to do so, we obviously need to give a mandate to the Union negotiator. Such a mandate should be put on sound foundations. I would like in this respect to set out a few considerations that should guide us when preparing this mandate. First of all, given the comprehensive mandate called for by the European Council, the scope of the negotiations is very broad. We cannot therefore afford to delay their start. An early start calls for an early adoption of the mandate. We intend to do that at the General Affairs Council on 25 February. This time constraint is made all the more stringent by Prime Minister Johnson’s decision not to extend the transition period beyond the end of 2020. Given the broad scope of the mandate, this will require that several strands of negotiations have to proceed in parallel. This is a negotiating mandate, not the final outcome of the negotiations. Therefore, it cannot spell out in full detail our expected landing zones, our final offers and the trade-offs we may have to contemplate. Adequate negotiating space should be preserved. Besides – and this goes back to my point about unity and time constraints – a very prescriptive mandate would require more time to resolve possibility, diverging interests and priorities. What we should focus on is the Union’s interest in achieving an outcome that is fair and equitable for all Member States and their citizens. Last, we have to factor in the UK red lines. The UK Government’s intention is to discontinue free movement, with an obvious impact on mobility and citizens’ rights, and also to diverge from the Union’s regulatory framework with no less obvious consequences in terms of access to the single market and trade in general. On the substance of the mandate, regarding the various sectors that should be covered, I think that we largely share the view in the Parliament’s position, as reflected in your draft resolution. This means a fair degree of ambition as compared to the Union’s relationship with other countries. It should be clear, however, that this cannot amount to giving the UK the same benefit as a Member State, especially in the light of its red lines. But let me focus briefly on more horizontal aspects of the partnership: governance and level playing field. There should be no doubt here. The EU might be prepared to offer an ambitious free trade agreement with significant market access, but this cannot be to the detriment of the competitive position of EU companies, social and health standards, or state aid rules. In other words, the partnership should include wide ranging provisions on a level playing field, based on high standards. This is all the more relevant given the UK’s stated intention to diverge from the European Union. In my view, this is closely linked to the issue of effective dispute settlement enforcement and remedies. There is no point in developing wide ranging level playing field provisions if they cannot be enforced. I will make two important remarks before closing. First, although we are well aware that the line of the UK’s Government is to put an end to the free movement of persons, we should see to it that the future relationship that we will start to negotiate shortly will be ambitious enough in terms of mobility. Second, and this is a link to my previous remark, these negotiations will keep both our institutions and the Commission busy for quite some time, but this should not make us forget about the Withdrawal Agreement. We should continue to monitor its thorough implementation. There is therefore once again a shared interest all along the coming negotiations in pursuing the good cooperation that we expected during the Brexit phase.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 2, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Ursula von der Leyen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the Commission. – Mr President, it’s just two weeks ago that we bid farewell to our British friends by singing ‘Auld Lang Syne’, and I think it was a most emotional, a very powerful moment in this Parliament: a moment to celebrate the good old times, and I thank you very much for the grace and the kindness of this gesture. This was extraordinary. Since then, we’ve set our sights on the future of our relations with the United Kingdom, and we will enter these negotiations with the highest ambition. Because good old friends like the UK and us shouldn’t settle for less than this. Prime Minister Johnson said in Greenwich earlier this month that the United Kingdom will, I quote, ‘be a global champion of free trade’. Frankly, this is music to our ears, because at a moment when the rules-based trade system is so challenged, we need our partners to join us in making the system fairer and stronger. And this is what we Europeans have always fought for over the years: a trade system that is open on one side and that is fair on the other side. Because what do free trade agreements do? Free trade agreements must replace uncertainty with a sound set of rules. They create new markets for small and medium enterprises. Free trade agreements must benefit the people. And this is just the rationale that is behind our trade agreements, for instance with Canada and Japan. They are not just increasing our bilateral exchanges of goods, services, people and ideas. They do that too, but not only. They also raise standards on a broad range of issues, from labour rights to environmental. And this is what makes us proud of them: ask our Japanese friends or ask our Canadian friends. They are glad that we have joined forces to put fairness into our globalised economic system. They are glad that they could join forces with the European Union, because frankly, in today’s world, size does matter – and we have a Single Market of 440 million people. What I just described – this is the ambition we have for our free trade agreement with the United Kingdom. And when we agreed the Political Declaration with the United Kingdom, we ambitioned zero tariffs and a zero-quota trade relation for all goods: something we have never ever before offered to anybody else. A new model of trade, a unique ambition in terms of access to the Single Market. But of course, this would require corresponding guarantees on fair competition and the protection of social, environmental and consumer standards. In short: this is plain and simply the level playing field. We are ready to discuss all different models of trade agreement. But all these models, whatever you choose, have one thing in common: they all come not only with rights, but also with obligations for both sides. For example, if we take the Canada model – and this is a model Prime Minister Johnson referred to – of course, our deal with Canada eliminates tariffs on a wide set of goods, but not on all. And of course, our deal with Canada eliminates most quotas, but certainly not all. For instance, there are still quotas on beef and sweetcorn. And of course, we still have our standards that have to be respected. And honestly, I was a little bit surprised to hear the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom speak about the Australian model. Australia, without any doubt, is a strong and like-minded partner. But the European Union does not have a trade agreement with Australia. We are currently trading on WTO terms. And if this is the British choice, well, we are fine with that, without any question. But in fact, we are just in the moment where we are agreeing with Australia that we must end this situation, and we work on a trade deal with them. Of course, the UK can decide to settle for less, but I personally believe that we should be way more ambitious. And the Prime Minister’s speech in Greenwich is an encouraging starting point. He recalled everything the United Kingdom has achieved in terms of social protection, climate action, competition rules, and I commend the UK for all of that. Indeed, it is not the time to lower social protection or to be lukewarm on climate action. It is not the time to decrease in terms of competition rules. I have heard ambition in Boris Johnson’s speech: ambition on the minimum wage, ambition on parental payments, and he has an ally in me where that is concerned. I have heard ambition on cutting carbon emissions. Ambition on guaranteeing that our firms are competing in full fairness. This is what we also want. Let us formally agree on these objectives. We can trigger an upward dynamic competition that would benefit both the United Kingdom and the European Union. To our British friends I say: it’s in our mutual interest. And most importantly, it would be consistent with the values we share – values of openness, values of fairness, values of social justice and free enterprise. These are not only values for the good old times. These are values to stay. Thank you very much for your attention. I just wanted to inform you that the Task Force is ready to start the negotiations. We’re all set.

As the Chair, I would like to thank all members of our group, as well as the involved Committees and the political groups, for their contributions in an extremely short period of time. In my opinion, the result is a very good and balanced resolution only nine days after Michel Barnier presented the Commission’s draft mandate. Our resolution contains Parliament’s views on the content and on the architecture of a future EU-UK relationship. Let me highlight three main principles of particular importance. Firstly, the integrity and the correct functioning of our internal market, the customs union and the Four Freedoms must be maintained. Secondly, a third country cannot have the same rights and benefits as a Member State of the EU. And thirdly, a level playing field is an overall priority and precondition for any future agreement. We should not, and we will not, enter a race to the bottom. As Ursula von der Leyen has pointed out, together with our British friends, we should aim for a partnership that goes well beyond trade and is unprecedented in scope: everything from climate action to data protection, fisheries to energy, transport to space, financial services to security. We are indeed ready to design a new partnership with zero tariffs, zero quotas and zero dumping. However a free trade agreement with the UK will not be equivalent to frictionless trade. Ladies and gentlemen, besides the negotiations on the future relations, the implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement is of particular importance. This concerns especially citizens’ rights, financial duties on the protocol on Ireland-Northern Ireland. Our chief negotiator Michel Barnier, whose work is highly appreciated across party lines in the institutions, has already assured us in the UK coordination group’s first meeting to keep Parliament fully informed at all stages of the procedure.

With the resolution that this Parliament is about to adopt, together we send a strong message: the ambition of the future relationship will depend on the British Government's willingness to accept conformity with Community rules on social, labour, tax and environmental matters.  On 1 February the UK formally became a third country and lost all its political rights. But in everything else nothing will change until this transitional period ends. We have eleven months to negotiate a complex agreement that defines our future relationships. In building this new partnership we must assume that nothing will be as prosperous as the rights and benefits of membership of the European Union.  The Social Democratic Group is committed to reaching a comprehensive agreement with the United Kingdom. However, the more barriers the British Government raises, the harder it will be to reach an ambitious agreement. On the contrary, if the United Kingdom is willing to remain on a balanced playing field as a fair competitor, we will be able to offer an association that guarantees the prosperity of citizens on both sides of the English Channel. And, to ensure this prosperity, we are ready to offer an ambitious free trade agreement, without tariffs or quotas, for all goods entering the common market and another for services. Moreover, if we want this benefit to be real, we also need a strong partnership on judicial cooperation, security and defence, support for the multilateral order, as well as addressing issues such as fisheries, transport, energy and financial services.  But our offer cannot be made at any price. Let me be clear. The United Kingdom must ensure fair competition, authorise European fleets' access to their waters and maintain its commitment to the European Court of Human Rights in compliance with its judgments. In addition, we will require that Spain have the final say in the discussions between the European Union and the United Kingdom affecting Gibraltar, as ratified in the Commission's guidelines.  Our success in the negotiations will depend on whether we are able to prevail what has so far been our best weapon: unity. Only with the Commission as the sole interlocutor with the United Kingdom, and with the full involvement of this Parliament for final approval, will the European Union be able to preserve the level of unity achieved so far. Together we have managed to protect the integrity of the single market, the Customs Union and the four freedoms, including the free movement of citizens.  Let us not forget that our project is articulated on the basis of a commitment to values that are exactly contrary to those manifested by some British leaders, imbued with nationalism and a false idea of superiority.

Mr President, the United Kingdom has chosen to leave the European Union and we have chosen to strengthen it. Some might see it as a contradiction that would make negotiating the future of our relationship more difficult. I do not think that is the case. That is not the case, because we respect the choice of the British. This choice to leave not only the European Union, but also the single market and the customs union, is a fairly radical choice, but we will respect it. It has consequences that are far from negligible and profoundly change the relationship we can build together.  This is not the case, because a strong Europe is in the interests of the United Kingdom. We are neighbours, allies and we are London's largest partner in terms of trade, but also in terms of human exchange. Geography is stubborn, facts are stubborn, and we have to face them. This is not the case, because we have huge challenges together: climate change, terrorism, cyberattacks, viruses are making fun of borders. We have to invent new ways to fight them together because separately we would all lose.  We are ready for a close, strong and lasting partnership with the United Kingdom, but we also hold strong convictions that we are deeply attached to and that Brexit cannot challenge. We have high standards to protect consumers, protect workers, protect the privacy and personal data of our citizens and protect our planet. We are not prepared to haggle over what we fought so hard for, why we continue to fight.  The draft mandate we support for negotiations with the United Kingdom is an illustration of these strong convictions that drive us; it proposes a partnership unprecedented in its scope and scale, at the height of what brings us together. It therefore asks for counterparties that are out of step with those in other agreements with other European Union partners - because the United Kingdom is not for Europe Canada, Japan, South Korea or Singapore; it is much closer, much more important, much more interdependent.

At the same time, I would like to see strong cooperation with the British, for example in the field of trade, where it is essential at home, in my own country, in Denmark, in order to continue to hold on to one of our closest and very best trading partners. In fact, Denmark at the time entered what was the forerunner of the European Union precisely because we wanted to continue to do business with Britain. When the British signed up, they made it clear that it was not an exit from the world or Europe, but that it was just an exit from the EU system. I think that in many ways is sympathetic.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, two facts: the first is that the United Kingdom and the European Union are bound by geography. That is not going to change, so we have an interest in maintaining as close and friendly relations as possible. Secondly: not everyone in the UK, far from it, is an English nationalist. The European Union has many, many friends in the United Kingdom; let's not alienate them. In trade, on the face of it, the ambitions of the European Union and the United Kingdom are antagonistic, since the United Kingdom wants maximum access to the European market, but refuses the regulatory alignment required by the European Union. So I invite all of us to be creative in this area. Let me explain: as a general rule, free trade agreements are used by the business community, I mean the holders of capital, to force a levelling down of working and pay conditions, social, environmental or fiscal standards. We could take the opportunity of a free trade treaty with the United Kingdom to do the exact opposite. Today, the legislation of the United Kingdom and the European Union is perfectly aligned in the areas of competence of the European Union, but therefore not in everything. In some areas - I am thinking of privacy, I am obviously thinking of social standards - the European Union has more ambitious standards than the United Kingdom. But there are other areas where the UK has more ambitious standards than the European Union - for certain aspects of environmental policy, or in banking regulation. We could set a rule in the new agreement by which both partners would commit to applying the two standards which is the most ambitious - and by the most ambitious, I mean the most protective of health, privacy, working conditions and remuneration, the environment. In this way, we would have a form of up-to-the-way emulation between the UK and the European Union. You will tell me that it never happened.

Time is limited and pressure is mounting to agree on an FTA this year. Formally, the negotiation is aimed at agreeing to a legal set of rules, but there is more to it. There is a mindset that varies on both sides of the Channel.  Every bureaucracy tends to cling to its own rules, awarding them holy status. In that respect the EU bureaucracy is not much different from the mandarins that once ruled the Chinese empire. It regards itself as the centre of the world, and of all wisdom. The British mindset is different. Having been an empire itself, Britain derives cultural self-confidence from the idea that it is still is an empire. The old empire does not want to be run by a possibly new one, so it left. What are the lessons, Mr President? The EU should not be bitter. Brexit is done and we have to put our citizens first. The EU has to be pragmatic and purpose-driven rather than rules—obsessed; focussed on tangible mutual interests, not on bad feelings. The current British government is the most stable in Western Europe – a big majority for five years. Who else can say that? But it should not overestimate the margins of divide and rule that worked for centuries – but not anymore.  Results will only be attainable through political will: the will to succeed.

So far, there is no central aspect of this debate here today: it is not the economy, ladies and gentlemen, in the end, but the citizens, it is the so-called ordinary people who will decide which will be the more attractive development model. That is what Brexit teaches us. The mandate we are discussing here must therefore put the interests of the people of the European Union and the British people at the heart of the negotiations. My group welcomes the clear statements on the prevention of tax dumping, on the protection of workers' rights and labour standards, on consumer protection and on environmental protection. No one needs further increased competition for tax dumping, no one wants worse working conditions, except for those who benefit from it, and that is not the workers, ladies and gentlemen. In short, we want the highest standards, the protection of peace in Northern Ireland and democratic control of the negotiation process. However, we are very critical to negative about many other aspects of the mandate, such as the issues of military cooperation, the positive reference to NATO, intelligence cooperation. We will engage constructively in the planning process in the interests of our constituents, knowing that a hard Brexit is still possible and that is not in anyone's interest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 10, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Christophe HANSEN", "mepid": "193419", "text": "   Mr President, by the end of the transition phase, the cost of Brexit will have exceeded the UK's cumulative contributions to the budget since it joined 47 years ago.

We offer a relationship free of tariffs and free of limiting quotas. What is being asked for in return is equal competition, to avoid any race to the bottom in terms of regulation, taxation, environmental and social matters. What we call in our jargon the level playing field must be worthy of the Premier League, today and after the transition phase. to that end, we also need a referee who is up to the challenge.

It has to do with Northern Ireland, the alignment of Northern Ireland and border controls in the Irish Sea.

You have free trade agreements with the whole world - as you do later with Vietnam - but you do not support, in the end, that the United Kingdom is no longer part of the customs union. It is now a third country, and we have to be aware of that.  The risk would be to turn it tomorrow into a gateway for products from all over the world that do not meet our standards and of poor quality.

Now we have a harmonised system and we have to decide how far we can go. In this respect, this is a little more comfortable than in other trade negotiations. That is why the three pillars, normal trade negotiations, must be taken into account. The issue of duty-free is the common objective. This can also be negotiated if it is ensured that the products coming from the United Kingdom that come to the European Union are actually British products and not products that come to the European Union via the United Kingdom from other countries. Secondly, there are the standards of products and services. We have a clear set of rules on consumer protection and health protection. The SPS standards will not be attacked in any way. So I think it will be easy to come to an agreement. And the third pillar is the most complicated. Of course, we must also discuss rules relating to trade, so that there are no distortions of competition. In other words, the question of equal workers' rights, the question of the same environmental standards, the question of the same aid scheme – very importantly – and the question of a harmonised tax rate.

The Commission has just a few months to prepare all those unilateral equivalence decisions – around forty, I understand – and the financial industry should be fully aware of how little time they have to adjust to the future situation. Efforts have been made recently, also in this House, to enhance the equivalence framework as the main regulatory tool for financial services in the future relationship with the UK. As equivalence is a unilateral discretionary policy tool, in order to make it deliver, we will need constructive cooperation with UK regulators and supervisors to protect the financial stability and integrity of our financial markets, protect investors and consumers, as well as ensuring LPF. But all of us here in this House must also be aware that for an ambitious, beneficial and successful future relationship with the UK in the area of financial services, it is our duty also to complete as soon as possible the Banking Union and build a genuine capital market union. The EU will preserve regulatory and supervisory autonomy, but so will the UK, and we just heard from the former governor of the Bank of England that the UK will not be a rule-taker.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Madam Minister, at your last session in Brussels , and Ursula von der Leyen referred to this moving session - you said goodbye to all your British colleagues leaving Parliament because of Brexit. At the beginning of this session, you will allow me to greet the new colleagues who join you and also to tell them, too, the availability that we have, that of the Commission, for their mandate. I would like to start by thanking you for your confidence, which touches me, and encourages an exceptional team that I have the honour to lead and which is that of the European Commission, which is also your negotiating team. I would also like to thank you for the content of your resolution, which marks principles, values and positions. Your negotiator needs and will need this determination, this resolution, throughout the coming months to help him in this difficult negotiation. Earlier, Mairead McGuinness said: \"the clock is ticking.\" I just want to remind you, on this subject of time, that the time of transition, which is set out in the Withdrawal Treaty, is indeed a limited time, which can be extended by one year or two years by a common agreement. If it is not extended, as we understand it, it means that the UK will leave the single market and customs union on 31 December this year. It is a choice, and this choice of time is determined by the British Prime Minister, not by us. And everyone must understand that this time constraints, before the United Kingdom leaves the single market and the customs union, this constrained time chosen by the British Prime Minister has consequences. Of course, everyone has to take responsibility for them. This constraint of time is not us who put it in the negotiation.  But that constraint also means one thing, because we are not in a trade negotiation — when we negotiate with Canada or with Japan, we try to get closer, to converge. Some people think that convergence is not enough, but we are getting there. If we do not reach an agreement with those countries, we take more time. We give more time to negotiation: one year, two years... For Canada, it took seven years. And until an agreement is reached, it is the status quo for both sides. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to remind you that, in this particular case, it will not be the status quo. If we do not reach an agreement on 31 December on trade, it will not be the status quo because that day, as the British Prime Minister has chosen, and no later than that day, 31 December, therefore, the United Kingdom will come out of the single market and the customs union and go back, if I may say so, within the WTO.  This means that beyond the controls we will do anyway, because of Brexit, on all the products that will come from the UK (as we do these checks on all products that come from third countries and enter the single market, to protect consumers and businesses), beyond these controls, which in any case are necessary , in this particular case, if there is a failure, if there is no agreement, there will be quotas and tariffs on all British products. That is the consequence, if we do not reach an agreement in this time constraint chosen by the British Prime Minister. Ladies and gentlemen, all your groups have called for a strong relationship, at the height of our common history. And we do not forget, I do not forget, this common history and solidarity of the United Kingdom, especially in the darkest hours of the last century. A logical relationship, of course, Philippe Lamberts said, when looking at geography. A necessary relationship, when we measure economic interests, but also climate issues or security issues. A lucid and demanding relationship, when we listen - which I am doing very carefully - to some Of the British discourse at the moment about the use that would be made - I am speaking on conditional, I do not want to make a trial of intent - of the new capacity for regulatory divergence that the United Kingdom wanted to achieve with Brexit.  This strong, ambitious, lucid, demanding relationship is the state of mind of the European Commission, as our President Ursula von der Leyen said earlier, and that is what is contained in the proposed mandate which is on your table and which is being discussed in the Council to be approved, I hope, on 25 February. A negotiation, ladies and gentlemen, with a partner - I repeat the words of Barry Andrews while time - a partner who must understand - and I say calmly but firmly - that the opening of our markets, access to data - I answer, Mrs in't Veld, to your question - the equivalencies for financial services, referred to by Danuta Hunner, I repeat: the opening of our markets, access to data, equivalencies - I mean equivalencies for financial services - will be proportional to the commitments made together to respect a real level playing field. Regulatory coherence in certain areas, the protection of citizens and, I would add, let us not have a short memory: the financial stability of our continent and the euro area. I would like to tele telegraphly respond to a few specific points. First, Geert Bourgeois spoke earlier about the issue of cooperation, particularly in the North Sea, on energy. I will be taking stock today with Vice-President Timmermans on this issue. Of course, Mr Bourgeois, we would like to see cooperation with the United Kingdom in this region of the North Sea on energy issues. This cooperation is also included in our draft mandate. But Brexit has mechanical and logical consequences. The British are no longer in the European Union, so the framework for cooperation must be reviewed, logically. The United Kingdom no longer participates in European forums because it wanted to, it is its choice, and therefore we must find, Mr Bourgeois, another way to cooperate with them and we will look for it. Paulo Rangel earlier, Mr. Lopez Aguilar at the time, Mr. Rzo-cca also, spoke about internal and external security. It is also in our mandate to open several negotiating tables on the subjects of internal security, cooperation in the field of extradition, Europol, Eurojust, anti-money laundering, Pum, PNR... These are all subjects that require an agreement with the British in the common interest, for the protection of the security of citizens. But also, and Mr. Alexandrov mentioned it at the time, external security. I mean on this subject of defence and foreign policy that Brexit should not normally have an impact on the bilateral cooperation that many of your countries have with the United Kingdom - I am talking about cooperation between this or that country of the Union and the United Kingdom - and therefore should not have any impact on what we are doing together in NATO. What this is about, for this negotiation, is the cooperation between the European Union, in particular the new initiatives we are taking for defence, and the United Kingdom, if it so will. So we made a proposal and confirmed this proposal to open a negotiating table on these issues. The political statement makes clear reference to external security and defence. We need texts on these subjects to insert administrative or political cooperation into the law and legal texts - I think of the Defence Agency, I think of the fight against cyber attacks, I think about cooperation between the intelligence services, I am also thinking about the possibility for the British to participate, if they want to , to external operations of the Union, military or civil-military, and I am obviously thinking of political cooperation with a very important country which remains a member of the United Nations Security Council. All of this has to be translated into texts and we are ready to discuss it, but there must be two of us to do so. So we are open and we remain open to this negotiation to improve the joint management of the security issues and stability of the continent.  We are also ready to discuss everything else. Earlier, Terry Reintke was referring to Erasmus. Of course, we must continue to cooperate in academic field, research cooperation, and the participation of the British, if they wish, in European programmes. And we will have a negotiating table, from March, on all the European programmes - I mean all the programmes, including Erasmus - but it will be with a different legal framework and a different financial framework today. Danuta H-bner spoke earlier about the issue of financial services and the relationship we need to have with the United Kingdom. Beyond what is written in the draft mandate and what we usually do in agreements with third countries, there will be no actual negotiations on financial services. On the other hand, we have to find a relationship with the United Kingdom, given the importance of London Square and the City, which I am familiar with. So we're going to use the equivalency toolkit, Danuta H-bner referred to. As we will in terms of data, we will use the adequacy decisions toolkit. We do not negotiate on these issues with the United Kingdom, we check consistency and, when we see it as possible, we give equivalencies on a particular sector of the financial industry. That is what we have done with Canada, what we are doing with the United States, what we are doing with Japan, and it is working. So I don't see why it wouldn't work with the UK. But I would like to take this session to make it clear to some British officials that there should be no illusions on this issue: there will be no general and comprehensive, or permanent, equivalence on financial services. There will also be no co-management of financial equivalency with the United Kingdom. We will retain control of these tools and maintain decision-making autonomy. At the same time, I would like to point out that in this period we have additional reasons to continue to act, and that is the purpose of our Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis' work for the union of capital markets and the continuation and consolidation of the banking union. I mean, fishing. Mr Bellamy, but also Mr M millon Mon, Mr Peeters, Mrs Schaldemose, Mrs Aguilera, among others, raised this issue, which I am familiar enough to have had the honour of being Minister of Fishermen of my own country for a few years. I just want to say that reciprocal access to territorial waters and markets - I mean reciprocal access to waters and markets - will be an inseparable point in the trade agreement, because it is trade. This will therefore be an inseparable point of the trade agreement and the level playing field in this negotiation.  Ladies and gentlemen, we have always respected, even if we have regretted it, the choice of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union. The Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, whom we respect, said that by leaving the European Union, the United Kingdom was not leaving Europe. We are pleased with this resolution. The question that is being asked and to which we do not have an answer at the moment is the following - it is quite simple, but quite serious: the United Kingdom is leaving the European Union, leaving the single market and the customs union, but does it also want to leave or move away from our European economic, social and regulatory model? A model he knows well, since we have built it with him for 47 years. That is the question we are waiting for an answer to. How far does the UK want to move away from our social, economic and regulatory model? And I would just like to say that it is he, ladies and gentlemen, I say this with great clarity and calm, it is the United Kingdom that will set the level of ambition for our future relationship in these areas, it is it that will choose the level of regulatory coherence, who will determine, therefore, the ambition, or who will choose the level of regulatory competition. And I recommend that the answer to this question that we ask be well thought out in the constrained time we have before us. I end with three telegraphic reflections. Ladies and gentlemen, I have always told the truth before you and I will continue. Brexit can't be business as usual. There are changes in all areas. Some changes may be more or less large or temporary, other changes are final. Brexit means that the UK financial service loses its financial passport. There is no mutual recognition.  The result of Brexit is that, in any event, ladies and gentlemen, we will impose controls on 1 January on all products that will enter the single market, as we do for all other third countries in the world. We owe this protection to consumers, to national and European budgets, and we also owe it to businesses. So it won't be business as usual. But we will try to limit the consequences by finding a good agreement. The second thought is that we must work to enforce and respect the withdrawal agreement ourselves. It is not a banality. The 600-page withdrawal agreement is now ratified by you and the House of Commons and must be implemented. I will report publicly to you and to the Council on a regular basis on the state of readiness throughout this year, in particular on the implementation of the protocol in Ireland, which guarantees a still fragile peace. Finally, this negotiation will be difficult, very difficult, ladies and gentlemen. I therefore recommend that we remain prepared for all assumptions, including one where we will not reach a basic agreement until 31 December. We remain ready to conduct this negotiation with respect, as I have always done, and a lot of calm, without any aggression. I will never lose sight of, beyond the difficulties of daily negotiation, the need to find, on your behalf, an ambitious agreement with a great friendly, neighbouring and allied country, and I will always continue, with total determination, to defend the interests of the European Union, its citizens, its businesses, to defend the integrity of the internal and unique market, which will not be , has never been and will never be negotiable. Finally, of course, Madam President, Parliament can be assured that the European Commission, as your negotiator, will always be ready to work with you, to listen to you, to report to you. I will therefore mark the same availability, as I said throughout these three years before Brexit and as I said the other day - it was a group led by Guy Verhofstadt, in the presence of David McAllister and the coordination group and in the presence of all the group chairs - I will continue to be fully available to work with the European Parliament , in confidence with you.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 55, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Nikolina Brnjac", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, I also join Mr Barnier in greeting the new Members of the European Parliament and I’m looking forward to our discussions here.

This new phase should not make us forget about the Withdrawal Agreement, which has just been concluded, and the need to remain vigilant as regards its implementation, first and foremost with respect to the preservation of citizens’ rights, be it during the transition period or under whatever future relationship with the United Kingdom.

These are the first state—of—the art trade and investment agreements on which this newly-elected Parliament is asked to give its consent. It’s a unique opportunity for this Parliament to underline the ambition of the EU to become a geopolitical actor and player: not as an empire that imposes rules, but as a global power that defends multilateralism, resists protectionism and reaches out to partners such as Vietnam. It is up to the European Union to promote rules-based trade and show by example that trade delivers, brings peoples together and raises standards worldwide on safety, labour, environment and human rights. It’s also a question of credibility. We need to show Vietnam and future trading partners that the EU is a credible partner that sticks to its commitment and that we are still able to negotiate, sign and conclude trade agreements. Eight years after starting the negotiations with Vietnam, this Parliament has been given the opportunity to debate the most comprehensive trade deal between the EU and a middle—income country in its history. As such, this deal with Vietnam sets a new benchmark for Europe’s engagement with emerging economies. If we look at this trade agreement, it is of the utmost importance to stress, first of all, the economic value that will give a boost to the prosperity of both the EU and Vietnam. It represents a great opportunity for European exporters and investors. It will eliminate 99% of tariffs within seven years, and this will result in additional exports in both directions. This will clearly result in many tens of thousands of new and, on average, better-paid jobs through increased use of international standards. This deal will also cut non—trade barriers and reduce costs for our companies. We will gain better access to each other’s public markets, including for SMEs. Vietnam has a vibrant economy of more than 90 million consumers, a growing middle class and a young, dynamic workforce. The country is open to the world and embraces modern standards. Vietnam was the first in the world, even before Canada, to accept the principle of a modern investment court system (ICS), a modern ICS proposal that has mostly been drafted by this very Parliament with independent judges, a code of conduct, protection of the right to regulate and facilitated access to the court for SMEs. This agreement thus brings new opportunities for companies, both big corporations and SMEs. Vietnam is also the gateway to the entire Asian region. This agreement brings the long—term goal of an EU—Asian trade agreement from region to region a step closer, and this should be our objective. These agreements are also instruments to promote and protect European standards and values. Vietnam respects clear commitments to the ratification of two additional core International Labour Organization (ILO) Conventions: its revised Labour Code, its improved labour and human rights situation and the implementation of the Paris climate agreement. For all these reasons and the creation of prosperity by free and fair trade and the fact that the EU is taking responsibility to set the standards worldwide and taking the lead on rules—based trade in times of rising trade tensions, protectionism and unilateralism, I therefore ask for the consent of this House so that the peoples of the European Union and the people of Vietnam can further strengthen their ties in the future and so that we can allow free and fair trade to bring people closer together.

The agreements will further reinforce our already-strong trade and investment ties, and they will also provide an additional opportunity to strengthen the cooperation established under other EU instruments, for example on illegal logging or IUU (Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated) fishing. The agreements will strengthen our presence in Asia, following the ‘new generation agreements’ in force, such as those with Korea, Japan and Singapore. They will constitute an additional stepping-stone towards our engagement with the ASEAN region. The benefits of the agreements are many: preferential access to a vibrant economy of almost 100 million people; removal of non-tariff barriers for our exporters, which they currently face, for example, on cars, on wines, and spirits; harmonised sanitary and phytosanitary rules allowing for more predictable procedures; and removing access barriers for EU products. EU companies will have access for the first time to the Vietnamese public procurement market, and there will be protection of the European geographical indications such as Parmigiano-Reggiano, Champagne and Rioja wines. We will also have improved access to the Vietnamese market in services, such as finance, distribution, logistics or environmental services. The Investment Protection Agreement, similar to agreements with Singapore and Canada, includes the modern and reformed investment protection framework with an investment court system for the resolution of investment disputes. However, our agreements will be on trade and investment, and I’m aware that the European Parliament has put a strong emphasis on the trade and sustainable development chapter of the Vietnam Agreement. And I fully agree with this approach. It is encouraging to see the level of engagement by Vietnam in order to prepare for the implementation of their commitments, with important progress made even before the agreements are in force at all. The pressure that has been exerted by the European Union is bearing fruit, and I welcome this development. On labour issues, Vietnam adopted a new labour code last November, which recognises the principle of freedom of association at enterprise level. The revised code also includes new provisions on collective bargaining in line with the ILO Fundamental Convention, which was recently ratified by Vietnam. Vietnam has now ratified 6 out of the 8 ILO conventions, and it has a clear plan to ratify the outstanding conventions by 2021 and 2023. Work is also ongoing in Vietnam to eradicate child labour, with encouraging preliminary results unveiled recently by the ILO, which is a significant reduction of more than 40% since the last survey of 2012. So these developments are remarkable. But nevertheless, the Commission will scrutinise implementation to ensure that Vietnam effectively pursues this ambitious labour reform agenda. Vietnam has also started preparing the ground for the institutional structure that is foreseen under the Free Trade Agreement, including the involvement of independent civil society organisations, such as domestic advisory groups.  The human rights situation is certainly an area of concern in our relationship with Vietnam, but I remain convinced that constructive channels of communication, including the Annual Human Rights Dialogue, is the way to voice our concerns and address these shortcomings. So Madam President, I firmly believe that these agreements will create the best platform for further engagement and constructive dialogue with Vietnam in all fields. On the other hand, our failure to ratify the deal would leave the European Union with fewer options to pursue a reform agenda in Vietnam and would undermine the credibility of the European Union as a reliable partner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 68, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Isabel WISELER-LIMA", "mepid": "197421", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the AFET committee.

Many of the commitments made by the Vietnamese authorities are made without specific deadlines. To be content with overly general declarations of intent is unforgivable naivety. On the environmental level, the contrast with the sacrifices that the EU imposes on its Member States is clear: in Vietnam coal is the main resource for electricity generation, coal is expected to contribute more than 40 % to the energy mix and about 100 coal-fired power plants are expected to be completed by 2030. There is also a lack of projects and a serious financial commitment to the purification of industrial water and those of the Mekong River, a threat to the seas and to the wholesomeness of vietnamese rice, which would like to be granted access to zero duty in Europe amounting to 80 000 tonnes per year, with the risk of triangulation from neighbouring countries such as Cambodia.

Madam President, after voting against a postponement of the agreement yesterday, our Assembly is about to make the first major gap since the inauguration of the European Commission: between its values, its principles, its statements on respect for human rights - including your report, Madam, the Wiseler-Lima report on human rights in the world, which we were voting on as recently as last year , but also the Green Pact, by ratifying the free trade and investment agreement with Vietnam.  Vietnam has committed to reforming its labour code, and will ratify ILO conventions, but to make effective freedom of association and expression and the emergence of independent trade unions, a reform of the penal code must take place; it is indispensable. And that is what we have asked for in letters to the Vietnamese authorities; we have called for a postponement of the ratification process to work together with Vietnam through dialogue. But, Mr Lange, Vietnam has put a real end to these questions, these demands.  So we now know that the reforms requested will not take place, especially at the criminal level, and yet we, as a parliamentary assembly, would be prepared to accept that, in the name of what? Economic interests. But which ones, Mr Hogan, which ones, Mr Bourgeois? Since the report, the European Commission's economic assessment shows that the deficit in our trade balance will be further aggravated by this agreement. We have apparently not met the same economic sectors of wood, textiles and rice, which, like us, are calling for a postponement of this agreement. Worse, the Vietnamese authorities justify the arrest of independent journalists, not to mention Mr. Pham Chi Dung, in the name of limits on press freedom. A nice snub for our assembly which, through the voice of its president, had challenged Vietnam on this matter. A big gap also with the green pact. Indeed, we will reward a country that practices illegal fishing and deforestation by unconditionally strengthening a free trade agreement and our investments there.  This is not to mention the potential conflict of interest that has shaken this file from the beginning, since we have continued our work as if nothing had happened. Colleagues, in recent weeks you have received calls like me from hundreds of NGOs, citizens and trade unions who apparently do not have your ear today. The request for postponement is also relayed on the grounds of the deterioration in recent weeks, in recent months, in recent years, of the human rights situation in Vietnam.

We have a unique chance to fill this vacuum. No other agreement with any other Southeast Asian country is on the way at the moment, not in sight.

You think - it's a bit of a magic thought - that a free trade agreement necessarily solves all the problems. No, that is not true. Firstly, I do not share the Commission's optimism that it is a win-win agreement. No! Today, the EU's trade deficit with Vietnam is $30 billion. In the Commission's impact study, we are told that within 10 years it will be $40 billion. And who's going to pay? Undoubtedly, a number of European employees in the most vulnerable sectors, for example textiles. So, to make Vietnam a kind of great workshop of the world, the risk is still relocations.  We are told that Vietnamese employees will benefit because they will adopt ILO standards, but finally, we have examples! Look at South Korea: we were made promises that were never kept.

And he was listened to! Vietnam is the new Asian tiger: with GDP increasing by 7 % a year, it is a country that is becoming faster and is therefore increasing its demand for high value-added goods, precisely the goods that we produce here in Europe. The agreement will bring almost all customs duties on these and other products to zero. Some of these duties, such as those on wines and cheeses, for example, now reach up to 50 %, not to mention those of cars up to 80 %. This agreement will then protect 169 PDO, DOC and PGI, 38 of which, 22 %, are Italian. So, if I think of my own country, for example, trade is only increasing. Our exports increased by 12 % last year, pushing import-exports to 3.7 billion and making Vietnam our main trading partner for the ASEAN countries. That's a number that's going to get even better thanks to the deal. The demand for Italian products is very high: over 300 million euros for our fashion export, over 65 for food and almost half a billion for machinery. Ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt that the agreement from a strictly commercial point of view is beneficial, and therefore deserves our vote in favour, but there is a problem. The human rights situation in Vietnam does not seem to be making any progress and some improvement reforms in this respect are still being approved. Personally, I am sure, like other Members, that the agreement will bring prosperity, help to change the situation in the future, and that is why, if there is a vote tomorrow, we will approve it. But I would ask you colleagues to postpone the vote.

Overall, the Trade Agreement with Vietnam benefits several sectors of the European Union and, in the agri-food field, meat or wine or cheese may be several of them. However, it is regrettable, once again, that the European Commission will give up protecting one of its sensitive sectors, such as rice. Vietnam has the lowest rice prices in all of Southeast Asia and competes directly with varieties produced in Spain and Italy. Spanish arroceros are outraged at this new concession and its impact on the prices of an already crisis sector. Being in deficit in rice production does not mean that opening borders does not cause irreparable damage to European production. I cannot understand why, after applying the safeguard clause in early 2019 with Myanmar and Cambodia, the European Union continues to make the same mistakes and does not appreciate the impact these imports will have on the European market and on a sensitive product such as rice.  The European rice sector plays a key role both in the economy and in the conservation of geographical areas with high environmental value.

It should only be said that this contract, i.e. contracts since we have a unified discussion, is written in such a way that it is adapted to the interest of corporations.  I'll give you three things. First thing, the contract grants special rights to the investor, therefore it isds, i.e. the state dispute settlement mechanism, it is that when there is a dispute there is no jurisdiction of the domestic court, but some distant international arbitral tribunal there.  There are many tragic examples here in Europe on the people of Europe where such a mechanism proved harmful, I will state only from the Abruzzo region where it was refused, therefore, the extension of the concession on the exploitation of hydrocarbons and then the oil corporations sued the region. Or let's say with us in Dubrovnik where the investor in the case of golf on Srdj lost in croatian courts. That wasn't enough for him, so he started an arbitration dispute for $500 million.  This mechanism simply undermines its own institutions, as they are, and the sovereignty of countries and so will Vietnam.

Can I thank Mr Lange, the Chair of the Committee on International Trade (INTA), Mr Bourgeois, the rapporteur, and all the shadows who have been involved in the scrutiny of this particular deal? To note that the four committee Chairs that are indirectly involved in this scrutiny have given their support for the deal. Can I thank former Commissioner, Cecilia Malmström, and the DG TRADE officials for their tremendous work over many years in relation to this deal? As many speakers have said, these are the first trade and investment agreements to be voted on by this Parliament. And I hope that they will receive your approval so that our companies, particularly our SMEs that have been mentioned by many of you, can start tapping into the potential and generate growth and employment. In such uncertain times for global trade, a positive vote of course will send a strong signal in relation to the EU’s commitment to an open and fair trade based on rules and values. I can assure you that we will monitor implementation very closely, because I agree with many of you that there are issues that have to be resolved and will constantly require us to ensure the Vietnam lives up to its commitments. I’m fully aware of these particular sentiments. But, in relation to some of the specifics that we mentioned, horse trade is usually associated with market access, and this has been a very good deal in terms of EU-Vietnamese reciprocity in so many products. Mr Juncker has mentioned issues in relation to food and can I confirm that the Free Trade Agreement liberalises all EU export offensive interests, like beef, pork, poultry, wines, spirits and beer, but it also has safeguards for some of our sensitive issues, like rice, sugar, sweetcorn and canned tuna. These safeguards are a new dimension in relation to our free trade agreements in recent years, which includes for the first time a free trade agreement that we are ratifying where safeguards are given in respect of tariff rate quotas (TRQs). We have also got recognition by Vietnam in this deal for the European Union to be treated as a single entity for sanitary and phytosanitary terms, which will reduce a lot of the non-tariff barriers that we have. Equally, our 169 geographical indications right around the European Union have been protected. On the trade and sustainable development (TSD) chapter, improving the implementation and enforcement of all our agreements is very important, and this is a key priority for the Commission. Vietnam is a good example of where they are making considerable efforts even before the deal has been implemented in relation to TSD matters, with important progress being made. So the pressure that you’ve applied is certainly bearing fruit. But we have also established an institutional structure through the domestic advisory groups, which will include all stakeholders, including NGOs, civil society, businesses and all the services that will have an input in relation to the implementation of this agreement. The implementation is very important. That’s why we’re establishing as well in the Commission a chief trade enforcement officer during the course of the next few months. The new labour code, which was adopted in November 2019, recognises the principle of freedom of association possibly to set up independent trade unions at enterprise level, as I mentioned earlier, which is outside the scope of the dominant Vietnam general confederation of labour. So Vietnam has started the implementation. It has a master plan that’s going to be implemented by January 2021 and one of the aspects is to check its consistency with all other legal documents, including the penal code and the criminal code. The ILO Conventions has said that six out of eight are implemented. We’re at the same stage as we were in terms of the implementation of this agreement with Japan. So I think this is good progress by Vietnam. Vietnam has started preparations to set up these independent civil society organisations, and last week they gave me an action plan and a timescale in relation to their implementation. I mentioned child labour. There has been a 40% reduction since 2012 and of course they are committed to a new action plan to eradicate poverty over the 2021—2025 period. Some Members have mentioned human rights, and rightly so. It does remain an area of concern in our relationship with Vietnam, but we must take into account where the country has come from and see clear evidence of progress in the last 25 years, notably in the socioeconomic domain. Human rights improvements are central to our engagement, and there’s a binding and enforceable link between the FTA, investment protection agreement (IPA) and the partnership and cooperation agreement (PCA) that allows for total or partial suspension of the agreement in case of systemic or severe breaches on human rights. We also have an annual human rights dialogue and there’s a meeting next week in Hanoi so these are all, I think, positives. There are divergences between us and I’m not saying anything otherwise, but we are convinced that the agreements provide an initial platform to engage with Vietnamese society and governments on these issues. This is the view of several Vietnamese NGOs who say that the implementation of this agreement would open more space for civil society. Now clearly Ms Daly and Mr Wallace have not heard those particular voices in relation to that part of the deal. The EU is of course also closely concerned about political prisoners and persons of concern. We have a list of persons of concern that we have been regularly raising in our exchanges at the highest level. And we are striving to make sure that the EU delegation are not only consistently ensuring that these people are released, but also attending trials, meeting family members and providing the best possible facilities for the families of these political prisoners. The FTA and the IPA will create another important and conducive environment to ensure that these issues are not put under the table, but are consistently high on the agenda. The lack of ratification of the agreement would leave the European Union with no instrument at all to support a reform agenda for Vietnam, and we will push Vietnam closer to other partners that do not necessarily share the same values if we don’t have this agreement. The institutional set up again, as I mentioned in the context of various fora to speak about these issues, is very important. Environment was mentioned: of course Vietnam is one of the countries that are most affected by climate change. So surely they are interested in implementing the Paris Agreement, which they have signed up to. And, under the trade and sustainable development chapter, this is explicitly mentioned. So their national determined contributions are going to ensure, like other partners around the world where we do deals, that are going to have to implement this in a legally binding way, as they have signed up to in relation to the Paris Agreement. So this is another win and another example of where we are providing the framework where we can implement, through this free trade agreement, the necessary leverage to ensure that these commitments are met. Vietnam has also concluded with the EU a forest law enforcement, governance and trade voluntary partnership agreement (FLEGT VPA), which has been enforced since 1 June 2019. And this particular partnership agreement aims to ensure that all timber products imported into the European Union from Vietnam are legal. This is very significant as Vietnam is a major processing hub, importing timber from over 80 countries, including from a number of high-risk countries in the region such as Cambodia. Under the VPA, Vietnam has to introduce mandatory due diligence obligations for its importers. Vietnam is currently working on the implementation of this particular scheme through the various licences that will have to ensure traceability. So our one major success in this field has been the open and constructive participation of all the relevant stakeholders in Vietnam during the negotiation phase. These are the issues that have come to the fore and we have got a response. We have to continue ultimately of course to reach our final destination and our objectives. Finally, on this issue in relation to concern about the investment court system, following the European Parliament’s demands, the investment protection agreement with Vietnam includes the most modern and reformed investment protection framework in any agreement with an investment court system for the resolution of investment disputes, replacing the traditional investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS) arbitration mechanism, and this has been confirmed as the proper way to go by the European Court of Justice decision that was recently made. So all of the elements of the ISDS under CETA are included in the IPA with Vietnam, which is an additional stepping stone towards the establishment of a multilateral investment court. Finally, in conclusion, could I say that, by voting in favour of this free trade agreement, you are voting in favour of a deal that will give us the political and institutional influence and the proper structures to make improvements on issues like human rights, like labour rights, like climate change and like environment policies. By voting ‘no’ you are consigning our influence to resolutions and letters that may or may not be taken into account and will most probably be ignored. This agreement puts the EU and Vietnam together in a political structure and enforcement mechanisms that will deliver common objectives, in particular in the policy areas that have been mentioned in this House. I know that many of these issues have been of concern for many years. Now we have a structured way in which we can deal with these issues. So it is time to be positive, to acknowledge that the EU stands together with the people of Vietnam, and vote positively for this deal.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 123, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Geert BOURGEOIS", "mepid": "197467", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, at the end of the debate, first I want to thank my colleagues in the Committee on International Trade (INTA), the shadow rapporteurs, and especially our Chair, Mr Lange.

Vietnam is a country in transformation. I believe these agreements will further contribute to the improvement of its prosperity, labour, human rights and living standards.

In addition, it also has a much wider meaning, because at a time when trade based on multilateral rules has been called into question, the European Union is strengthening relations with Asia (similar agreements with Singapore and Japan have already been concluded in the past). This signals to the rest of the world, and in particular protectionist directions, that the EU is open to constructive international cooperation. The EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement is the most comprehensive and ambitious agreement of the kind ever concluded between the EU and the developing country. Vietnam has a population of almost 100 million people and is one of the fastest-growing countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN. The agreement will abolish almost all tariffs between Vietnam and the EU over a 10-year period, while protecting European products of symbolic significance and allowing European companies access to the Vietnamese public procurement market.

In fact, such a report is the main instrument for expressing our views towards ECB policies for maintaining price stability and strengthening the eurozone economies, thereby leading to a higher degree of real economic convergence.  The timing is important. This report is the first of the new legislative term and following the election of the new ECB President. And, of course, like the President has said, we are very glad to have you here today with us, Ms Lagarde. The report focuses on the review of the current ECB policies, future monetary policy, actions against climate change, and a stronger global role for the euro.  Regarding the monetary policy actions of the ECB in 2018 and their impact on the euro area economy, we welcome the ECB’s role in safeguarding euro stability. The non-standard monetary policy measures put in place by the ECB contributed to economic recovery, to an improvement in financing conditions and to compressing yields across a wide range of asset classes. We also stress that the very low or negative interest rates offer opportunities to consumers, companies (including SMEs), workers and borrowers who can benefit from stronger economic momentum, lower unemployment and lower borrowing costs. At the same time, we ask the ECB to keep monitoring potential risks to its balance sheets, asset price inflation, disadvantages to savers and the potential impact on pension and insurance schemes. However, we are concerned that after a short economic recovery, euro area growth momentum has slowed to 1.1% of GDP in the euro area, and therefore we note the need to maintain both the liquidity conditions and a degree of monetary accommodation. Recognising the sustainable growth cannot be achieved by monetary policy alone. We underline that supportive fiscal policy is also necessary.  We also agree with ECB President Christine Lagarde’s statement that a review of the ECB’s monetary policy framework is timely and warranted, and we stress that this should be done by organising a public consultation and involving Parliament. An important point also raised in this report is the finding of the European System of Central Banks Expert Group on low wage growth, stating the disconnect between wage growth and labour market recovery ceteris paribus. Accordingly, the unemployment rate in August 2019 stood at 6.2% in the EU and 7.4% in the euro area, the lowest since July 2008. But this drop in unemployment has not been reflected in wage growth.  Two words strengthening the role of the euro area. It requires the right structural conditions, including the deepening of the European Monetary Union, the completion of the Banking Union with the European Deposit Insurance Scheme and the completion of the Capital Market Union. Special emphasis is given to the fight against climate change and the implementation of the Paris Agreement. We stress that the ECB is bound by the Paris Agreement on climate change and this should be reflected by implementing the environmental, social and governance principle into its policies.  We underline other aspects interrelated with ECB policies regarding Brexit, the Capital Markets Union, crypto-assets, the need to increase monitoring and to have a comprehensive regulatory framework, the importance of micro, small and medium-sized businesses in the EU and their access to credit, more efforts to ensure the financing of the real economy and much more. On accountability, we welcome the increasing accountability under the Presidency of Mario Draghi and we express our will for even greater accountability, dialogue and openness with the current President.  A final point. It is essential to formulate our monetary policy but also to communicate it to our citizens, as they need to understand the importance and the impact of those policies on their lives. I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive and fruitful collaboration during the negotiations, and I do believe that the European Parliament and the ECB have a common objective. This was my primary objective when I drafted this report – to improve the lives of our citizens by achieving real economic convergence and to strengthen the role of the EU as it is our common home.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 133, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Christine Lagarde", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Central Bank. – Mr President, Executive Vice-President Dombrovskis, rapporteur Mavrides, honourable Members of the European Parliament, I am delighted to participate for the first time in a plenary session and to discuss your draft resolution on the ECB’s Annual Report for 2018. Independence and accountability are two sides of the same coin for the ECB, and one will not exist without the other. This is why the ECB’s relationship with the European Parliament is so important. The ECB’s Annual Report is a central element of this relationship, and Parliament’s resolution and the subsequent feedback we publish are evidence of the good dialogue between our two institutions. Having only joined the ECB almost to the day 100 days ago, I read the draft resolution with particular interest. What struck me in particular was our shared assessment of many of the challenges facing the ECB and the euro area. I felt exactly the same as I was listening to you, Mr Mavrides. Indeed, the universal nature of these challenges underscores the need for our continued dialogue. Today, I would like to focus on two of the overarching concerns that stand out from the draft resolution. Number one, the role of monetary policy in the current economic environment and, number two, the structural challenges facing the euro area economy. Euro area growth momentum has been slowing down since the start of 2018, largely on account of global uncertainties and weaker international trade. Moderating growth has also weakened pressure on prices, and inflation remains some distance below our medium-term aim. Against this background, the ECB’s Governing Council has acted in a determined fashion to achieve price stability, which is the mandate that we have under the ECB Treaty. The ECB’s monetary policy since 2014 relies on four elements: a negative policy rate, asset purchases, forward guidance, and targeted lending operations. These measures have helped to preserve favourable lending conditions, support the resilience of the domestic economy and – most importantly in the recent period – shield the euro area economy from global headwinds. Our policy stimulus has supported economic growth, resulting in more jobs and higher wages for euro area citizens. As you just mentioned, Mr Mavrides, euro area unemployment, at 7.4%, is at its lowest level since May 2008. Wages, as you have mentioned as well, increased at an average rate of 2.5% in the first three quarters of 2019, significantly above their long-term average. 2.5%.  But monetary policy cannot, and should not, be the only game in town. The longer our accommodative measures remain in place, the greater the risk that side effects will become more pronounced. We are fully aware that the low interest rate environment has a bearing on savings income, asset valuation, risk-taking and house prices. We are closely monitoring possible negative side effects to ensure that they do not outweigh the positive impact of our measures on credit conditions, job creation and wage income. Such reflections played a role, for example, when the Governing Council decided to introduce a new regime for remunerating the excess reserves held by banks with the Eurosystem, the famous clearing system that we introduced. Other policy areas – notably fiscal measures and structural polices – also have to play their part. These policies can boost productivity growth and lift growth potential, thereby underpinning the effectiveness of our measures. Indeed, when interest rates are low, fiscal policy can be highly effective: it can support euro area growth momentum, which in turn intensifies price pressures and eventually leads to higher interest rates. The European Green Deal and national initiatives to finance the ecological transition could add to these dynamics by contributing to stronger and more sustainable growth. The European Parliament’s draft resolution on the ECB’s Annual Report highlights three structural developments affecting the ECB’s operating environment: digitalisation, climate change and the institutional architecture of Economic and Monetary Union. I would like to use the remaining time that I have to discuss very briefly these three challenges. Digitalisation and climate change were not made in Europe. They are global phenomena. They will not wait for us to gear up and get ready; they will affect us whether we are ready or not. So we need to prepare as best we can. In this spirit, the ECB is assessing the potential and implications of technological developments for payment services and financial stability, and it is also making an active contribution to such innovations. To this end, we set up a Eurosystem task force in January to investigate the opportunities and challenges associated with different potential designs for a central bank digital currency and to test how they would work in practice. In particular, we want to assess whether a central bank digital currency could serve a clear purpose for the public and support the ECB’s objectives. Together with five other central banks and the Bank for International Settlements, we will share experiences in this area and assess the potential cross-border use of such digital currencies. We also have to gear up on climate change – and not only because we care as citizens of this world. Like digitalisation, climate change affects the context in which central banks operate. So we increasingly need to take these effects into account in central banks’ policies and operations. The ECB has already moved in this direction. First, we are working to extend our knowledge about the economic impact of climate change and ensure that its effects are better reflected in our economic analyses, in our models and in our forecasting methods. Second, through its financial stability tasks, the ECB is monitoring systemic risks stemming from climate change and the transition to a carbon-neutral economy. This work will ultimately enable us to test how well the euro area banking sector is able to withstand climate-related risks.  Finally, the ECB has taken steps to align its own investment decisions with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. This is so in our staff pension fund, for instance, where we decided to switch to a low-carbon index, and we are investigating what else we can do in our market operations. The strategy review launched by the ECB’s Governing Council last month will also take stock of how rapid digitalisation and the threat to environmental sustainability – together with globalisation and evolving financial structures – have further transformed the environment in which monetary policy operates. The strategy review will consider all aspects of the ECB’s policy framework. We need to reflect on how we can best deliver on the ECB price stability mandate for the benefit of all European citizens. As part of this process, we will consult with the public and listen to their views, expectations and concerns with an open mind. We will indeed also work very closely with those in your Parliament who are directly interested and concerned about those particular matters and we have begun that journey. While I have thus far focused on the ECB, it is important to recognise that digitalisation and climate change are universal developments that affect all of us in Europe and worldwide. But Europe is uniquely positioned to master these challenges. Building on common safeguards and competitive incentives, the Single Market offers enormous potential for economic modernisation. Europe can harness this potential in its quest to design effective and affordable responses to the challenges at hand. But an important pillar of Europe’s response to an increasingly globalised world – Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) – should not be forgotten in the process. And the role of the European Parliament, as co-legislator, in getting our response right cannot be understated. Over recent years, the euro area’s architecture has evolved substantially. But as you know, some essential elements are still missing or are incomplete, hampering its ability to deliver its full potential for euro area citizens. This is why the ECB has been advocating and will continue to make the case for a more complete EMU: Economic and Monetary Union. Very quickly, I will remind you of what I mean by that. It is a full banking union underpinned by a common deposit insurance scheme; it’s a true capital markets union that channels investment to innovative and productive uses; and it is a central stabilisation function as a common line of defence in case and when we have shocks. A more resilient Economic and Monetary Union with these elements would not just help to protect our living standards from adverse domestic and global developments. It would also support Europe’s influence in the world, including by making the euro more attractive worldwide. Let me close by highlighting the joint nature of the challenges. What I have discussed will require all parties to do their bit to enable Europe to perform at its best for all of its citizens. This includes the ECB, which within its mandate is ready to play its part. As I said at the beginning, the universal nature of these challenges also underscores the need for continued dialogue between the ECB and the European Parliament. In this spirit, I am very much looking forward to the exchange that we will have during the rest of this afternoon.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 134, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Executive Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, it’s a pleasure to be here today to discuss with you and with Christine Lagarde, President of the European Central Bank (ECB), the very timely report on the ECB annual report. By a coincidence of the calendar, the European Central Bank launched a review of its monetary policy strategy on 23 January, the day of adoption of the report at committee level. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Costas Mavrides, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) for their work. The Commission largely shares the general lines of the report. We concur with the view that the ECB’s statutory independence in the conduct of monetary policy is crucial to the objective of safeguarding price stability. Today’s debate reinforces this independence in that it bridges political independence and democratic accountability. Like the report, the Commission considers that monetary policy alone, which is an ECB competence, is not sufficient to achieve sustainable growth and price stability. The euro area economy should also be supported by a mix of growth—friendly structural reforms and by appropriately-differentiated fiscal policy. This is all the more important as the European economy, while continuing to expand, has entered a period of more subdued growth. This is linked to the less-supportive external environment, ongoing structural shifts and high uncertainty, for instance regarding trade policies. Let me make specific reference to a couple of points in the report that are relevant to the Commission’s political agenda. First, the Commission has made the transition to a climate—neutral economy a priority with the European Green Deal. The European Green Deal will make consistent use of several policy levers: regulation and standardisation, investment and innovation, national reforms, dialogue with social partners and international cooperation. In the context of the European Green Deal, we agree with the ECB’s conclusion that climate—change—related financial stability risks hold the potential to become systemic for the euro area, in particular if markets are not pricing these risks correctly. We will soon launch a consultation on the next steps on the sustainable finance agenda. Our aim is to develop a renewed sustainable finance strategy by early autumn which, among other things, will aim to improve the way climate and environmental risks are managed and integrated into the financial system. We will also establish the EU Green Bond standard and explore how it can increase public and private finance for sustainable investments. The review of our own economic governance framework will, just like the ECB strategic review, look into the effectiveness of our rules in delivering on its key objectives. Debt sustainability remains important, as financial stability is a pre-condition for growth and job creation. But we will also encourage broad debate on the framework in order to make it more efficient. Second, we welcome the call for swift completion of the Capital Markets Union and the Banking Union, including setting up a European deposit insurance scheme. A strong monetary union is key to fostering the international role of the euro. In this respect, we welcome Parliament’s encouragement to work with the ECB and all relevant stakeholders on those projects. The Commission has started technical work on crisis management and insolvency law. This is an important avenue to be further considered to complete our crisis management framework and help make progress towards a steady—state Banking Union. Third, I would like to underline the importance of our work on payments and crypto-assets. I would like to thank the ECB for their crucial work on payment infrastructure. This is essential to make instant payments in Europe a reality. I also welcome that the ECB and other central banks are looking at the potential of central bank digital currency and are engaging with European payment actors to bring about faster, more efficient and cheaper payments. I have no doubt that today’s debate will be very fruitful, and I trust that you will confirm the constructive engagement that has developed between the European Parliament and the ECB over the past years.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 135, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Markus FERBER", "mepid": "1917", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, Madam President, Mr Vice-President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said.

As you see in the report, Madame Lagarde, we are worried about the incompleteness of our banking union. I’m glad to hear Mr Dombrovskis say that the Commission’s work programme is going to push in this direction.  We share very much the views that you expressed about what the priorities are, Madame Lagarde. We think that the ‘doom loop’ is alive and well. We think that it is still the case that, if we have a big bank fail, there will only really be states behind that bank and that our construction will not be sufficient. Because we have done a banking union that was supposed to consist of three pillars. The first pillar, which is supervision, is in place. The second pillar, which is resolution, is kind of in place, but not really in office – ‘in office but not in power’ I guess is a better way to put it. It is not really acting to resolve most situations and most banks which are failing. The third pillar, as Madame Lagarde has pointed out, the deposit insurance, is not yet there.  We believe that we need a banking union that cuts this knot between the banks and the states. We think that we need this principle of bail—in, rather than bail-out, to be enforced. And that means that the Commission has a lot of work to do. We will support that work and will really encourage you. We realise that it is politically difficult. I think the Parliament is ready to come behind a solution and I ask Madame Lagarde for your support. And Mr Dombrovskis for your work on this, thank you very much.

Draghi has, for sure, printed more money than anyone, at some point, somewhere since 1925. The ECB printed 40% of economic output, the Fed and bank of England only 25% and 15%, and no one else broke EU law more joyfully than Draghi. In 2009, the EU economy was significantly larger than the US economy. The financial crisis also hit the US harder. Then came Draghi, and in 2018 the EU continued to have more people, but the smaller economy. Youth unemployment in southern Europe is up to 35% – a success for fewer and fewer young people! In Germany, savings and pensions are melting away like the glaciers in the summer. Draghi leaves behind scorched earth. Who benefits?

Madame Lagarde, when we asked you about the Central Bank digital currencies at the ECON hearing, you responded that we need to ‘rush slowly’ and welcome you elaborating on that here. Mr Dombrovskis also concurred. That means that the importance of this project is well understood, and I think that it will be supported by Parliament here.

It remains very fragmented in the European Union with four models or so being used, and the mandates of the European institutions either overlapping or not very clear.

I want to welcome those comments. We just had an election in Ireland where the cost of housing was one of the main issues that dominated voters’ intentions. Serious advances have been made to address the problems but in Dublin, for example, rental prices have doubled since 2010 and property prices have gone up 85% since 2013. I think one should be putting more focus on the fact that house prices and rent rises are increasing rapidly across Europe and I think that we need to have more diverse financial instruments to deal with this. It goes back to a very important remark that you made yourself before you were appointed President of the ECB. You said the ECB needs to understand and explain to people not only the markets.  I think if we are to rebuild trust with citizens, I think your consultation project in the Member States is very important. I see that as really democracy building, very important, but I think the housing issue is crucial because if we want to keep in touch with our citizens, we need to understand properly and account for the serious issues that they face in society.

We are underestimating how difficult the situation has become. Discussion of the subject is constrained because many would not like it to sound as an attack on the ECB’s monetary easing policies. True. So long as fiscal policy is not being deployed to bolster economic growth, such policies remain essential, and I agree with that. But, they’re also causing collateral damage to banks. Other very significant factors are adding to the damage, like an overload of regulations raising operational costs. Yet, while the Capital Markets Union is being promoted in Europe, the reliance on banks for business financing has grown. Banks are curtailing their services to cut costs and to remain profitable, with negative economic and social consequences.

Given the eurozone's persistent vulnerability and the completion of EDIS, a key piece to ensure savers with increased risk reduction measures, they remain a necessity for the Union. Moving forward with EDIS, we could reduce financial fragmentation by ensuring a wider role for private capital in cushioning economic and financial shocks. But I would like to reiterate this: to insist only on risk reduction as a precondition for the launch of EDIS is wrong. We cannot try to reduce risk by weighing up, for example, government bonds.

I would like to first of all thank you very much for this dialogue that we had. It’s very much part of what we at the European Central Bank, and more broadly within the euro system, want to actually have with public opinions, with civil society representatives, but more importantly, with those who represent the citizens of Europe: that is you, Members of Parliament, who have been elected by them. This is very much part of the accountability that we have towards you and, through you, to the citizens of Europe. We have conducted a few changes in the last few months, but certainly one of those that I very much look forward to implementing as we go into the strategy review that has been approved last month, is the constant dialogue that we need to have, and what we have called the outreach with you and, through you, with the citizens of Europe. So thank you for that. I thought I would just touch on some items of our strategy review to address some of the points that you have made. First of all, some of you have touched on the monetary policy and the current components of the instruments that we use in order to implement our policy and have been doing so since 2014. To those who argue that this monetary policy, and particularly its unconventional tools, have been counterproductive, I would very strongly encourage them to look at the impact that those unconventional tools have had on the economy – in which way it has actually increased growth and helped our economies around Europe and the euro area in particular to fare better than it would have had it not been for those instruments that were used as part of the unconventional policy. It’s obviously very difficult to quantify carefully and precisely by how much growth has been lifted in the euro area, but our models actually indicate that that growth has been probably higher by a margin of about 2.5% to 3% ever since those policies were put in place. In the same vein, it has contributed to inflation which, as you know, ever since the euro was put in place and ever since the strategy was revisited in 2003, is measured with reference to inflation, and clearly those unconventional tools that have been used since 2014 have helped inflation go up a bit. Well, certainly we would have liked it a lot more than that, and maybe this would have been the case if other tools had been used in conjunction with our monetary policy. But be it as it was, certainly inflation has increased by a factor of about half a percentage point probably, which is certainly not bad, given the level where we are. To those who were mentioning, by the way, that inflation was hovering around 1%, I would simply remind you that in January inflation was at about 1.3%, which is certainly not the goal that we have, but certainly a bit more than the 1% that was mentioned. Those unconventional tools that were used and the instruments that were deployed helped our economies and continue to help our economies. When you look at the volume and the number of new financing that are put in place for the real economy, whether it’s the corporate or whether it’s the households, we are seeing clearly financing that is very low in terms of cost, and I take the point that you made, sir, about the Irish banks and how much they charge and what interest rates they include, and we’ll look into that for sure. But the cost of financing has been low and lower for the real economy. And number two, the volume of financing of the economy has increased and has continued to increase. You will have seen some comments recently about the fact that this continuum is slowing down. Yes, it is a little bit – for the corporate, not for the households – but it is continuing to grow nonetheless. So I would contend that, in the main, it has had a very positive effect on our economies, and as part of our strategy review, we’ll look at how much and how effective it has been. But we will also look, as some of you have mentioned, to the potential side effects and to the accumulated side effects that it could have on citizens and on the economies as well. So that will be very much part and parcel of our review. The second point that I would like to emphasise briefly, and I’ve focused on the monetary policy tools and how we will look at them and measure them and measure the benefits as well as the negative effect, is climate change. Nobody can ask the European Central Bank to substitute what governments should do and what policies should be in general. As former managing director of the IMF, I think I’d be remiss not to remind all of us that one of the key tools in relation to climate change is clearly the proper pricing of carbon, and this is not something that a European Central Bank or any central bank in the world can actually decide. So as we go through our strategy review, we will determine where and how the issue of climate change and the fight against climate change can actually have an impact on our policies, whether it’s in relation to our price stability primary objective and how it impacts this primary objective, or whether it’s in relation to the management of risk that we are accountable to our European citizens and to you when we look at the composition of our portfolios and the one that we manage, and whether or not risks are actually properly priced and whether the climate change risks associated with some of the collateral that we have in our portfolios, for instance, are measured or not. So in that respect, climate change will be one of the items that we will take into account, together with the more traditional aspects that we will be measuring, and it’s in the context of that strategy review, Mr Vice-President, that we will continue this dialogue, not only with you, but also with the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON). The president of ECON was here and many members of the Committee are present in this room. We will continue to engage: we will have that dialogue, and we want that very much to be a two-way street. Now, I offer our apologies to those who had very specific questions on particular countries, but I propose to take that up bilaterally with those who are interested in specific countries or banks going forward.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 169, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  I can only wish you all the best for your work personally and in the interests of the European Union and in the global interest.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 170, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Costas MAVRIDES", "mepid": "124691", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, I too will be brief.

These were put in place in 2017 as part of the European Union’s efforts to foster a credible and meaningful process that can lead to a peaceful, negotiated solution for the reinstatement of democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela. These measures include a travel ban and asset freeze regarding 25 individuals, among them the Vice-President of Venezuela, Delcy Eloína Rodríguez Gómez, included on this list having been designated by the European Union on 25 June 2018. A travel ban requires the European Union Member States to take the necessary measures to prevent the entry into, or transit through, their territories by the listed persons. As you know, there is a division of competences in the area of sanctions within the European Union. First of all, Member States are responsible in all cases for the implementation and verification of sanctions adopted by the European Union in their own jurisdictions. Member States, I repeat, are responsible in all cases for the implementation and verification of sanctions adopted by the European Union. Therefore, when the issue of a possible violation of sanctions arises, for example an assets freeze or, as here, a travel ban, it is for the Member States concerned to investigate and determine whether this has in fact been the case. With regard to the wider oversight of the implementation of sanctions, the Commission has an overall monitoring role concerning the uniform application of such measures in an area with these competences. For example, this is the case for asset freeze and sectoral measures, but it is not the case for travel bans or arms embargoes. We can discuss the political appropriateness for Member States to give this competence to the European Union, although this would require a treaty change. But the situation, for the time being, is clear. The Commission cannot initiate any infringement procedure regarding a possible travel ban violation. Travel bans are, in practice, only contained in Council decisions and they do not therefore fall under Union law. Consequently, the Commission does not play a role in monitoring the implementation and cannot initiate an infringement procedure. As High Representative, talking here from the side of the Council, I am also responsible for ensuring the consistent application of the common foreign and security policy, including sanctions adopted by Member States in Council. In this context, the European External Action Service, in consultation with the European Union, where competent, would be directly in touch with the European Union Member States regarding alleged violations in order to ensure that these sanctions are being applied in a homogenous way in all Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 174, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Dolors MONTSERRAT", "mepid": "197711", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, Venezuela and Venezuelan politics have come to Spain with Iglesias and Monedero. It is not my words, but those of Pedro Sánchez, current president of the Government of Spain. He said them in 2016, and now we know that for him it was not a criticism, but a compliment. Today, Iglesias is the vice president of his government and Chavista politics soils the image of his government.  The Government of Sánchez has opened Europe's doors to chavismo, because a socialist minister, José Luis Abalos, met with dictator Maduro's vice-president, Delcy Rodríguez, on Spanish territory, on European soil, violating the sanctions regime imposed by the European Union on a totalitarian regime, which tramples on human rights.  Sanchez's government hasn't just breached. Sanchez's government is lying. Any new version about the encounter makes the old one a lie. It has lost all credibility and it must be the European institutions that investigate the truth.  Venezuelan is a sister town for Spanish. For the millions of Venezuelans trampled by the despot Maduro, for the millions of Venezuelans who have fled their country, we need to know the truth and that the sanctions regime be complied with.  The Spaniards and the rest of the Europeans, this Parliament, have always raised our voices in defence of Venezuela's freedom.

This issue is of fundamental strategic importance to the European Union. For too long, we have been witnessing a conflict that has caused endless suffering for generations of Israelis and Palestinians alike. The increasingly dire situation on the ground, including violence, terrorism, incitement, settlement expansion – illegal, by the way – and the consequences of the ongoing occupation, has destroyed hope on both sides and reduced the viability of a two-state solution. At an international level for a number of years there has been little or no substantive engagement in efforts to resolve the conflict. Indeed, as one observer pointed out to me recently, there is neither peace nor a process. In recent years, we on the European Union side are perhaps the only actor who has stayed the course. We have been vocal in our support for a negotiated two-state solution based on the internationally agreed parameters and in accordance with international law. This means a two-state solution based on the parameters set in the Council Conclusions – our Council – of July 2014, that meets Israeli and Palestinian security needs and Palestinian aspirations for statehood and sovereignty, ends the occupation that began in 1967, and resolves all permanent status issues in order to end the conflict. Our vision, our European vision, is a principled one and a pragmatic one. It reflects our broader attachment as Europeans to the rules-based international order. We are also active on the ground. No other international actor has been as engaged as we have been in practical efforts to build a future Palestinian state. In 2019 alone, the European Union and its Member States had an open portfolio of some 600 million in assistance to the Palestinians. I said during my hearing: it means – 600 million is almost EUR 1.5 million a day. Where are we today? It remains my firm view that there is still a way forward if both parties are willing to resume credible and meaningful negotiations. International support for any such efforts would clearly be crucial to their success. In this regard, the tabling of concrete proposals, such as the United States one, could be helpful, both as a catalyst for deeper reflection on the way forward and as a potential opportunity to quick-start a political process which has been at a standstill for too long. However, as I have said, the proposal tabled two weeks ago clearly challenges the internationally-agreed parameters, and it is difficult to see how this initiative can bring both parties back to the table. 25 out of 27 Member States in the Foreign Affairs Council supported this consideration. Two were against, so it was not a unanimous decision of the Council and I could not present it like this, but as a statement of the High Representative, which I am repeating here again. Last week I was in Washington; they were very busy days, talking with all foreign affairs external policy higher authorities of the US Government. I put this point to my interlocutors. We need to ask ourselves whether this plan provides a basis for progress or not. We need to know whether the proposals themselves are really open for negotiation. Is it the starting point, or the end point? For the European Union’s part, our position is clear. We are ready to work with the international community to revive a political process in line with international law, which ensures equal rights and which is acceptable to both parties.

Mr Borrell, you stated that the United States Middle East peace plan departs from internationally agreed parameters. You also used rather pointed language originally when you said that part of this plan, if implemented, could not pass unchallenged. Naturally this evoked a reaction from our Israeli friends, who warned that this type of – what they called – ‘threatening’ language could lead to the EU’s role in the peace process being minimised. Meanwhile, the Palestinian leadership has angrily dismissed President Trump’s plan as a conspiracy.  I think it’s frankly unreasonable to expect that either side would greet this proposal with any real enthusiasm, but I would like to choose to view the glass as half full and not half empty. So this plan could perhaps serve as a basis for resuming talks in earnest with the understanding that there are, in fact, painful concessions to be made on both sides. This is your moment to shine, Mr Borrell. Europe could perhaps assume a much more prominent role, an active role, as an honest broker of just and lasting peace.

Let me be clear, negotiations between Israel and Palestine were broken off in 2014 and must be resumed as soon as possible. But that is not what this plan will lead to. This plan disregards the international rules-based order. It not only normalises illegal settlements but also clears the way for the utterly illegitimate annexation of the Jordan Valley and 30% of the West Bank. We must make clear that such actions will have serious consequences for our relationship with Israel if that happens. Inevitably, it will also lead to more suffering for the Palestinian people, whether that is because their land is annexed, their water resources are taken or because they lack control over their own borders. This is a cynical plan of two far-right leaders seeking a cheap popularity boost ahead of elections. This is a slap in the face of Israelis and Palestinians who genuinely want to find a solution.

A missed opportunity, you might say, were it not for the fact that Trump's proposal has now completely sniveed off the fragile relationship between Israel and Palestine.

It is not fair and even-handed, it does not follow the basic principles of international law and its drafters only managed to engage one of the two parties to the conflict.  Whatever domestic political ends in the US or in Israel the plan’s launch may have served, its chances of revitalising the peace process are, unfortunately, virtually non-existent. Moreover, if Israel, following Palestinian rejection of the plan, were to restart settlement activity or go on to annex parts of the occupied territories, it may be entirely counterproductive to sustainable peace and eventually prove detrimental to the two- state solution altogether. The EU must stick to its principal position of holding firm to international law. We must continue to uphold the position that only a negotiated two-state solution can, in a sustainable manner, address the legitimate Israeli security concerns and deliver a Palestinian statehood.  But, in addition to having a clear and principled understanding of where we need to be at the end of the process, the EU also needs a credible plan of its own on how to get there from where we are today.

We know this is a very divisive issue. It is in the Council and it is in the Parliament. But I would like to remind you that I’m not expressing my personal opinion. My job is to be the High Representative of the Council and I have to represent what I think is the opinion of the Council. Mr Zver, I haven’t said that this statement was the position of the European Union. I precisely said – and you should have listened to me – that since it was not unanimous – and it is in the records – I could not present an agreement of the Council. It was a statement of the High Representative, representing whom? Representing the 25 Member States who agreed with the statement. I said very clearly – you didn’t notice – so I will repeat it. It was not a statement of the European Union. It was a statement of the High Representative and was not unanimous.  Mr Zver, why did I go to Iran? Because I have a mandate – a unanimous mandate – from the Member States of the Council asking me to go and talk with everyone in the broader region of the far Middle East to try to see if there is any possibility for us, the European Union, to contribute to increasing stability and peace in the region. I have a mandate to go and talk to everybody. Everybody means everybody, and I have been talking with the Foreign Affairs Minister of Saudi Arabia, I went to Jordan, I have been talking with the Emirates, I went to Tehran and I will go to Iraq in order to have a look at what we Europeans can do in order to contribute, if we can, to the peace and stability of this region.  I am sorry, Mr Zver. I was confused. It was not you who spoke about what was or was not in the statement of the European Union. I think it was our colleague, Mr Ruissen. Sorry, I made a mistake. So my answer was directed to Mr Ruissen. My answer to you was relating to what I did in Iran. For sure we talked with the Iranians about everything that worries them and that worries us, but the main purpose was to ask what we can do in order to save the nuclear deal and what we can do in order to stabilise the region. We didn’t spend much time talking about the Israeli—Palestinian issue because the Iranians are very much aware that they have nothing to say on that problem.  Another Member – I think it was Ms Kempa – asked with whom I have been talking in the USA. Well, with the most prominent people, with Secretary of State Pompeo, with the National Security Advisor, Mr O’Brien, with Mr Kushner, the author of the plan, and with Ms Nancy Pelosi. And for sure the first three were very much in favour of their plan, while Ms Nancy Pelosi, who as you know is a Democrat, was very critical of it. As I say, I am not expressing my opinion. In fact my opinion is of no interest here. I am expressing the majority of the Council, and the majority of the Council has supported the statement in which we sent a message saying that, first, everybody has to refrain from any unilateral actions contrary to international law which could exacerbate tensions further. We are asking that no one annexes the Jordan Valley. Yet this may happen. If it happens, you can be sure that it is not going to be peaceful. Maybe for some it doesn’t matter, but for us it matters a lot because we cannot provoke a wave of violence – another wave of violence – in Palestine. We are asking Palestinians to keep calm and not go to violent demonstrations. We asked for the proposal to be considered as a starting point and I said clearly that maybe it could break the stalemate and create the dynamics in which we can go and talk again about what we can do in order to look for a solution to this very old, damaging and painful problem.  I am not denying the possibility of this being a starting point. What I am denying is not this possibility, but the fact that it is being considered as an end point because, if I tell you ‘come and negotiate, but I’ll tell you one thing. If we don’t agree, I will implement my proposal anyway.’ – this is not a big incentive to negotiate. ‘Come and negotiate but be aware that, if you don’t agree with me, I will implement the proposal anyway.’ Do you call that a negotiation? That’s what we refuse. And that is what we have been saying.  And believe me, we invited Secretary of State Pompeo to come to the Foreign Affairs Council to explain directly to all Member States their proposal. I know that there are some who are closer to this position and others who are very far away from it. I know that there is not going to be a unanimous position on this. It’s too divisive. But we have to discuss and we have to look, if not for unanimity, for the majority – whatever it is – and, believe me, I don’t think the majority of the Member States of the European Union are considering this proposal as a good starting point. But we’ll do our best and talk with everyone in order to try to break this stalemate and push for negotiations.  Some very optimistic people asked me why we don’t try to do something like we did many years ago in Madrid – the Oslo process and the Madrid process. I think we have the commitment to do something. We cannot just refuse. We cannot say that’s not good enough. We have to look for something that works and this is going to be part of the discussions that we are going to have next Monday in the Foreign Affairs Council.

It is the most severe humanitarian catastrophe and security crisis; it is unfolding right now in the north-west of the country, and in other parts of Syria we continue to see instability and dramatic human suffering.  Last Thursday, we heard the United Nations Special Envoy Geir Pedersen and the Head of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) Mark Lowcock briefing the United Nations Security Council on the situation in Idlib. They described how regime forces led by Russia and Iran are launching heavy military offensives with no regard for the civilian population or civilian infrastructure. ‘We appear to have lost sight of the principle of proportionality’, the United Nations Special Envoy said. The intensification of military operations in Idlib has resulted in the indiscriminate killing of hundreds of civilians. Attacks continue on civilian targets in densely populated areas, on medical facilities and settlements for internationally displaced people. These are blatant and serious violations of international humanitarian law. There has to be accountability for those responsible. Since military operations began in Idlib in February 2019, one year ago, more than one million people have been displaced towards Turkey – we are talking about one million displaced people in one year – and every day more Syrians are fleeing the fighting and another wave of refugees is quite possibly in the making.  We also see clashes between the Syrian regime and Turkish forces, plus the risk of Turkish and Russian militaries confronting each other. These tensions could in turn trigger a wider regional conflict. The ceasefire agreed between Ankara and Moscow must be implemented. This is the situation.  Now, let me say this. After almost a decade of violence, the suffering of the Syrian people at the hands of the regime and its backers must cease. Too many people have died and those that are alive face a bleak future. The EU has major stakes in Syria, and in the surrounding region. We cannot afford more regional instability and another migrant crisis. We must avoid a resurgence of Daesh and other terrorist organisations on Europe’s doorstep.  The EU has a duty to preserve the rules-based international order, including the legitimacy of the United Nations Security Council. Yes, I know, we say that again and again, and we have to continue saying that. Recent military gains by the Syrian regime are not translating into stability. On the contrary, the Syrian regime will not bring peace and stability to Syria if it continues to pursue on military logic and the repression of its people. The economic situation is deteriorating rapidly, exacerbated by the banking crashes in Lebanon. The regime must change its behaviour.  We have stated from the very beginning that only a comprehensive and inclusive political solution, in line with United Nations Security Council Resolution 2254, will allow sustainable peace and stability in Syria and the region. The EU will continue to support the efforts of United Nations Special Envoy Pedersen in relaunching the Constitutional Committee in Geneva. We also need to focus on other parts of this resolution, such as a nationwide ceasefire, the release of detainees, and making progress on the file of missing persons. Let’s recall that the European Union is, and remains, the largest humanitarian donor to Syria and its people, both inside, and to Syrian refugees and host communities in neighbourhood countries. We are supporting the resilience of ordinary civilians and civil society to maintain the social fabric of Syrian society. We are convinced that our support is a fundamental investment – it is not an expenditure, it is an investment – in the future of Syria and the region, which is part of our future, and as a partner of the global coalition to defeat Daesh the EU is conducting stabilisation projects in the north-east of Syria. We are always prepared to do more on all these lines of action, within the limits of our common red lines. These are: no normalisation with the regime, no risking of our funding being diverted to the regime or to the terrorists, and no reconstruction before a political process is firmly under way. We will continue to apply European Union sanctions targeting individuals and entities associated with the regime and responsible for its repressive and inhuman policies – and not the Syrian people. As I said before, the conflict in Syria is a geopolitical struggle. The European Union has a responsibility to lead for the sake of the Syrian people and to protect our own interests. While difficult, we must redouble our efforts to identify common interests with our other international stakeholders – Russia, the US, Turkey and others – and maybe I will have occasion to update on our discussions with Washington about this issue.

The war in Syria, as you have already said, is in its 9th year. Idlib province is the last battleground in the Syrian conflict, which Assad is likely to deal with the opposition and consolidate its power. Civilians are fleeing from the government's Assad forces to the Turkish border, which is impermeable and, according to humanitarian organizations, is crowding around a million people, some of them moving repeatedly. I agree that the EU must provide humanitarian aid to these people, and I also call for continued projects in the conflict-affected provinces.  We know that around 70% of fleeing civilians are women and children. That is why I want to call for the EU to continue to support the education of children even in the very difficult conditions of refugee camps. We know that it is important that these children do not lose perspective, but it is not a solution that we need to be interested in in the long term. At the moment, idlib's fate depends on negotiations between Damascus, Moscow, Ankara and the United States, and I want to ask: what role does the EU play and will play here?

Everyone is already saying it here: a proxy war between Russia and Turkey, with millions of people fleeing. The question of what Europe can and must do is, of course, easier to ask than answered. I'm very aware of that. But Europe, we must be honest about that, has left things to rot. Because we have given Putin and Trump free rein, and that is why we are now in this very unsafe situation. What has been a matter for us, we must dare to say clearly, is the divisions in the Council. With, among other things, but not only the Italian government, which sought rapprochement with Assad. I do not blame the Italians, but I do not blame Europe for not achieving unity in this regard.  Europe can only contribute to a sustainable solution if we have one strategy, one strategy that we promote together. Time is running out, because both Turkey and Israel have reasons to loosen their grip on Assad. Europe must therefore come up with a new plan very quickly and increase its commitment, with the first goal for me - perhaps the first and only goal - a ceasefire.

Let us be strategically action-oriented and not waste any more time. A new strategy must recognise the strength and potential in the African economy, pursue the long-term strategic and mutual interests of the EU and our African partners, and support the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  For the EU-Africa strategy to be successful, I believe that three things are necessary. Firstly, a clear vision of the end game, and a concrete plan to use a comprehensive approach with all available tools. Secondly, an awareness of what can be gained if we succeed in strengthening our partnership and what is at stake if we don’t. Thirdly, defining how we can better use aid-effectiveness tools at our disposal and that the Commission take a lead in coordinating all EU institutions and Member States.  There are plenty of mutually beneficial opportunities – economic growth, employment and trade. There are also immediate challenges – climate change, poverty, conflict and irregular migration. The high population growth that we see in Africa also means that poverty levels will continue to increase. In 2030, global poverty is expected to be almost exclusively centred in Africa. Conflicts tend to brew in countries facing poverty and with high levels of unemployment. On behalf of the Committee on Development, I have tabled a series of questions to the Commission and hopefully today we can get some clear answers. Firstly, how does the strategy effectively contribute to the implementation of the SDGs and the fundamental objectives of poverty eradication? What measures and what mechanisms will be put in place?  Secondly, how will the new strategy contribute to the strategic interests and common priorities of both partners with a view to good governance, human rights, the fight against inequalities, climate change, etc.? Thirdly, how will the Commission ensure the involvement of numerous stakeholders, like national parliaments, governments, local authorities, the private sector, civil society, in the design of the strategy?  And fourthly, let me also express some concern regarding the potential for overlaps. What I’m talking about is the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), in which Africa is of course a priority, as well as the negotiations on the future of the ACP-EU Partnership Agreement. To be concrete, how will the Commission ensure consistency and avoid the risk of developing overlapping strategic frameworks?  Finally, development policy coherence is something that is in our Treaty obligations and it’s high time that we tried to deliver on that commitment. Therefore, I would like to know: how will you make sure to incorporate development policy coherence in the strategy design. To conclude, from the colleagues in the Committee on Development: we do look forward to working together with the Commission. We have a huge task in front of us but also great opportunities. Let’s get the work started together.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 264, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Jutta Urpilainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to start by thanking you for inviting me to discuss such a milestone in Europe—Africa relations as the new EU strategy for Africa. As I committed during my hearing to do my utmost to strengthen and deepen the cooperation between the Commission and the European Parliament, I am glad to exchange with you here today.  How more appropriate for my first address to this Chamber than discussing our relationship with the African continent? I value your experience, knowledge and views and believe them to be important for a topic such as this one. On our first trip outside Europe, President von der Leyen and I went to Hear Africa. We experienced a continent of youth, brimming with confidence, full of potential and attractive for the global players. We met a partner that deserves a more positive engagement from us. We have already paved the way for change with the Africa—Europe Alliance for Sustainable Investment and Jobs, supported by the External Investment Plan for sustainable investments, and have achieved, in such a short amount of time, tangible progress. Now we can capitalise on those achievements and go further. It is time for a new chapter that brings a step change in our relationship. For that to happen, we need a new, comprehensive strategy, a strategy that supports Africa’s potential political economic governance efforts and moves to bolster peace and resilience, a strategy with Africa that ensures partners’ ownership and commitment, and a strategy that better positions the EU in the new global context, reflecting the aims of this geopolitical Commission and the ambitions of the European Green Deal.  The Abidjan priorities we set back in 2017 remain valid today. Our approach is not to change direction, but to step up a gear for better results. The strategy’s comprehensive character will be ensured by its inbuilt links with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris Agreement on climate change, the EU Global Strategy, the European Consensus on Development and Agenda 2063 of the African Union.  We will continue to work on economic continental integration, human development, mobility and migration. Thematically, apart from addressing the climate and environmental challenges, we will focus on digitalisation and gender equality, which are major enablers for development. There cannot be development without solid governance, respect for human rights, the rule of law and democracy. Therefore, we will pursue our efforts in these areas, along with the fight for peace and security, and against extremism.  Finally, yet importantly, we would like to work closer with our African partners on the multilateral rule-based system that is being called into question more and more. A key priority through my mandate, I will ensure that the implementation of this strategy supports the power that youth represents. Young people, including young women, must also own this strategy. Work on the new ambitious framework is already ongoing, both at political and technical level. In the meantime, we continue listening and trying to ensure broad ownership of the strategy, both by yourselves and our Member States, as well as by our African partners and civil society, including young people.  We will hold an EU—AU ‘college to college’ meeting on 27 February in Ethiopia and a ministerial meeting in May. Both events will provide key opportunities for dialogue with our African partners. I intend to travel to Africa in February and March to consult as broadly as possible. The proposal for the new strategy will be on our college agenda for adoption in early March. That will mark the beginning of more concrete work with our key stakeholders.  I look forward to our debate and hearing your views on what you see as priority areas for a renewed Africa—EU partnership.

Why do we need a new EU-Africa strategy? Because the EU Commission has explicitly defined itself as geopolitical for the first time and is committed as a whole to the implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, because of the pressing problems of climate protection and migration, because the Cotonou Agreement has to be re-concluded and we have the Green Deal, because of the rapid development of digitisation and a new free trade area in Africa. These are all new realities that an EU-Africa strategy must address. In my view, it is important that we apply the whole toolbox of the EU and the Member States in a coherent manner and learn lessons from the past. This means, first and foremost, a focus on fair trade relations and the generation of tax incomes in African countries, educational opportunities, democracy and rule of law support, efficient administration and security structures, greater support for women and girls and the involvement of regional and local levels rather than mere traditional budget support. The aim must be for every African to have a secure perspective on life in his or her home country. We need responsibility, both on the part of the EU and on the part of Africa, for a genuine partnership that is mutually beneficial. Last year, our group chairman, Manfred Weber, made it very clear, among other things, with his proposal for an Africa Commissioner, the high priority of the EU-Africa issue for the PPE-DE.

Moreover, the European Union is by far Africa's largest partner in trade and development. Suffice to say that we, as the European Union, already have extremely close ties.  However, relying on maintaining the status quo could be extremely counterproductive. What we need is a comprehensive strategy covering both the political, security, development, economic and commercial fields. A real strategy of this magnitude must set clear goals over time, as well as a roadmap to achieve them. In fact, it is the transposition, in a way, of the Delors method that, in the 1990s, enabled the European Union to make considerable progress in our relations with the African continent. Today, development in Africa is clearly conditioned by Africans themselves, but also increasingly by China, India and Russia, which are fordesting increasing economic, political and military ties. It is against this backdrop that the European Union's cooperation with Africa must be asserted.  Why do we not have in common a security approach that allows the African Union to sit on the UN Security Council? Why not agree, now, on a common approach to climate change?

In this context, the vague promises of partnership on an equal footing come a little late, especially since, from unfair fisheries agreements to the desire for increased political interference in Africa, there is no evidence of this so-called new diplomatic and trade departure.

They identified four priorities for joint action, including investment in human capital, resilience, peace, good governance and investment in structures for sustainable development and migration.

The strategy will work towards fighting global challenges that both our continents simply cannot, and must not, ignore. 2020 will be a pivotal year for the Africa-Europe partnership. We agreed with the ACP chief negotiator, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Togo, Professor Robert Dussey, that we will aim at closing the post-Cotonou negotiations by the end of March, and we will hold in the run up to the African Union-European Union summit a number of side events, with the main stakeholders all providing opportunities to design our partnership together. We will also strive to ensure that we will dispose of the right means to implement our policies by facilitating the agreement of the MMF in good time.

Even with the population of Africa, its geographical situation and the ongoing political transformation of its countries, Europe must be its primary strategic partner and ally. At present, the biggest challenge linking the two continents is migration. In order to address the root causes of migration, we must, above all, help to create security in African countries and contribute to the eradication of poverty, job creation and, in short, sustainable development. Education must be the primary means of doing this. Access to quality education is the key to simultaneously and horizontally in effect on different sectors. Through education, we enable people from developing countries to help their own communities locally in their home countries. In addition to primary and secondary education, we must also remember tertiary education, which is the engine of innovation. Scholarship programmes are the best way to help in this area, Hungary does so. The new comprehensive EU-Africa Strategy should provide a solution to address the root causes of emigration and contribute to sustainable development, both economically and socially, in Africa. For this purpose, the Commission will have in its hands the main resource group, the Neighbourhood, Development and International Cooperation Instrument (NDICI), which will allocate nearly EUR 30 billion to the development of the sub-Saharan region.

For several years now, a worrying increase in the number of manifestations of hate speech, hate crimes, racism, xenophobia and intolerance in Europe has been observed, affecting minorities and other vulnerable groups, including Jewish people. In particular, we note with strong concern that anti-Semitic hatred remains widespread. Let me be clear on this: there is no justification for this phenomenon and we are obliged to take such issues extremely seriously.  There are a number of legal instruments that offer protection against racism and related forms of intolerance. All EU Member States have accepted the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. The EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights also prohibits discrimination on the grounds of race, colour, ethnic origin and religion or belief.  The EU has furthermore adopted specific legislation on combating intolerance and hatred. I refer in particular to the 2008 Framework Decision on combating racism and xenophobia. In June 2016, the Council invited Member States to ensure the effective transposition and implementation of the Framework Decision and other relevant hate-crime laws at national level. In addition, it asked Member States to develop effective methods to report and ensure proper recording of hate crimes.  On 6 December 2018, the EU Member State Governments also sent a clear message by adopting a Council Declaration on the fight against anti—Semitism and the development of a common security approach to better protect Jewish communities and institutions in Europe. The Council notes that anti-Semitic hatred remains widespread and invites EU Member States to take measures to tackle anti-Semitism and improve the security of Jewish communities.  Social media is one of the main vehicles enabling hate speech to go viral. One possible remedy against this epidemic is a harmonised and determined European response. In this area, the Council conclusions on the application of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, adopted in October 2017, welcomed the measures coordinated by the Commission’s High Level Group on combating racism, xenophobia and other forms of intolerance. We also welcome and support the ongoing EU level dialogue with major IT companies, and address hate speech online, including through the implementation of the Code of Conduct launched in 2016 by the Commission for this purpose. Last but not least, we should remember and commend the remarkable work done by the Fundamental Rights Agency in this field.  The countermeasures I have mentioned so far would, however, be insufficient without recognising the important role of education and youth work, and, more precisely, the need to develop democratic resilience, media literacy, tolerance, critical thinking and conflict resolution skills in the learning process.  It is important to bear in mind that the measures in place to fight hate crime can only fulfil their potential if victims report hate motivated harassment and violence to the police, and if police officers record such incidents as hate crimes. According to the Fundamental Rights Agency, only a fraction of victims report hate motivated harassment and violence and, when they do, police officers do not always recognise them as hate crimes. Fortunately, Member States are increasingly introducing measures to address this issue. This includes providing relevant guidance for police officers, requiring the collection of detailed data on crime and working with civil society organisations experienced in dealing with hate crime.  In short, the responsibility rests with all of us – politicians, teachers, civil servants, students, parents and, where appropriate, judges and prosecutors – not to close our eyes or ears and pretend not to see injustice, discrimination or hatred. From the horrors of Auschwitz, the world learned its lesson and built an order of peace, founded upon human rights and international law. We are all committed to defending this.

Holocaust survivor Liliana Segre shared with us her moving story about the evils of humanity she confronted as a young girl. She reminded us that hatred, racism and anti-Semitism is still today haunting European societies and endangering our diverse societies and the minorities in our midst.  It is the duty of the EU to prevent history from repeating itself and to uphold the values upon which the Union is based. The Holocaust has shown us where anti-Semitism and racism can lead and its memory is at the very core of the European project of a Europe that protects its Jewish communities and all other minorities.  We have seen that fear and hatred against ‘the other’ has become normalised in recent years. It flourishes in mainstream media, in political debate and in the online world. It is a major challenge to our whole society and not only to the affected communities. The anti-Semitic attack against the synagogue in Halle is only the most recent example but, on a daily basis, minorities become victims of hatred online and offline.  It has been a key priority for the EU to ensure first and foremost the correct transposition and implementation of the relevant EU legislation, including the Racial Equality Directive, the Employment Equality Directive and the Framework Decision on racism and xenophobia. The Commission has been working closely together with Member State authorities and civil society in the EU High-Level Group on combating racism and xenophobia to ensure the effective application of the rules against hate speech and hate crime by the whole enforcement chain. The developed tools will assist Member States in strengthening a practical response to implement. Dedicated formats of the high-level group will ensure in the future that the tools are implemented by Member States to make tangible progress in recording and responding to hate crime and hate speech. In particular, as regards hate speech, the Commission has pushed for stronger action; it initiated the code of conduct on combating illegal hate speech online whereby major IT companies have committed to review flagged hate speech within 24 hours and remove content when necessary. Fast progress has been achieved. In 2016, only 28% of the content was removed. Now it is above 70%, and 89% of the notices are assessed within the committed period.  We regularly monitor the progress. Next month we will present the results of the fifth monitoring exercise carried out together with civil society organisations. We managed to bring together all actors from civil society, IT companies and state authorities to strengthen our response to hate speech online. Our two coordinators on combating anti-Semitism and anti-Muslim hatred have been proactively reaching out to Jewish and Muslim communities, and strengthening the collaboration with international organisations, Member States’ authorities and non-governmental organisations. We also intensively work on implementing the EU-Roma strategy containing measures against anti-Gypsyism.  The adoption of the Council Declaration on combating anti-Semitism was a milestone. All Member States unanimously agreed on actions and were invited to develop national strategies. The Commission created a dedicated working group to ensure concrete follow-up to the Council declaration and support Member States and Jewish communities to work together on developing these strategies. We are glad that the incoming German Presidency has announced already their intention to place the fight against anti-Semitism high on the agenda.  Distorting our common history has been one of the trademarks of fanning the flames of hatred and division, be it by third countries or within our own societies. Where today there are attempts to deny or distort the memory of the Holocaust, where people are vilified because they are Jews, this is where Europe is called into question. Attempts to distort our history are threatening our foundations. Disinformation and fake news attack our past but also, and first of all, our present. Our democracies must be harnessed to respond to this challenge and they must themselves adapt. Online platforms have been misused to disseminate and amplify manipulative messages to distort the democratic debate and interfere in the political process.  For four out of five Europeans, disinformation is a problem for democracy. We must ensure that democracy remains well protected in Europe. To better harness our democracy, the Commission will put forward a European democracy action plan. It will help counter disinformation and support free and independent media and will also aim to ensure greater transparency of paid political advertising and provide clearer rules on the financing of EU political parties. Transparency and accountability is essential, as well as not allowing external interventions in our democratic systems by those who wish to divide and destabilise our Union. This is a common priority for the Commission, European institutions and the Member States. As we see minorities under pressure again today, we must raise our voices and redouble our efforts to ensure that Europeans can go about their lives free from the threat of anti-Semitism, racism and xenophobic hatred.  The Commission is looking forward to working with the European Parliament and in particular the Anti-Racism and Diversity Intergroup and the Working Group on Anti-Semitism.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 294, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, I have listened to many speeches, but one that will stay with me for a long time to come was given by Marian Turski last month, 75 years after he, weighing all of 32 kilos, walked out of Auschwitz. He called for an end to indifference. ‘Auschwitz did not fall from the sky,’ he said. It happened slowly, because too many people turned a blind eye to justice, too many people found comfort in scapegoats, and too many people accepted prejudiced laws.  That is why we fight anti-Semitism, racism and any hatred everywhere today, because in Europe we know only too well the depths of horror that man has sunk to and can sink to. If we teach people not only about what happened, but about how it happened, slowly through gradually increasing measures, then maybe we can truly learn the lessons of history, even when the voices of the survivors can be heard no more. Now, today, we still witness attacks on Jews and synagogues in Europe, we still see the scapegoating going on, and we are still seeing states move slowly away from the values this Union was founded upon. We see our fundamental rights under threat in too many places.  So we cannot be silent when Europeans live with a packed suitcase by their door, just in case. We cannot be silent in the face of injustice anywhere. Let no one fighting for justice ever look to Europe and be met as they have been met – with shrugs of shoulders or excuses that favour political expediency.

Anti-Semitism once culminated in the worst, most inhumane and cruel genocide humanity has ever known. He produced the abysmally worst of people.

This was also demonstrated by the debate today. Europe's right-wing populists are not only subliminal in their anti-Semitism; Openly, they are deliberately inciting hatred in order to turn existing anti-Semitism in people's minds into moods and voices.

I say to the House: I would like to react on several comments. Indeed, you quoted here the survey of Fundamental Rights Agency and Eurobarometer, which really show alarming and shocking figures. When you ask the Jewish citizen in the EU what is his or her main concern, the answer is security. When you ask the European people who are not of Jewish origin, they will say ‘we have concerns about our health, our jobs, our family’. And this is really very alarming that the Jewish people have such an elementary fear and that they plan to leave Europe. Jewish people leaving Europe has never been a good sign, and this is not a Europe we want. And I think it was Ms Ries, who left already, she asked whether we are doing enough. I regret to say ‘no, we are not doing enough yet’, and we have all of us the obligation to do much more. The Commission worked hard to deliver or achieve some tangible results in the fight against anti-Semitism. We decided to promote the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism, which now is used also by the majority of the Member States. We are openly speaking and addressing the sources of anti-Semitism and it was also mentioned here: it is far-right, far-left, it is Islamist radicalism and also old conspiracy theories. That’s why we urged the Member States, the ministers of home affairs, to adopt the decision to create the strategies on a Member States level. The anti-Semitism strategies, which will bring very concrete plans especially into areas, in the security area and in education. The strategies are now in the in the process of creation and under the German Presidency, we will look at these strategies and will decide on how to continue further. We want to see concrete measures accompanied with money. On security, I think it is absolutely intolerable that the Jewish communities have to finance their own security and the protection of Jewish premises, such as schools and synagogues. We have to do much more on education. It should also be reflected in the national strategies and accompanied by money, and here comes also European money because we have in the values programme a dedicated amount for education in this field. I was also in Auschwitz two weeks ago, commemorating the 75 years after liberation of the camp and I was listening to authentic testimonies of the survivors. We will not be able to hear these testimonies from authentic people very soon. We have to find a way how to explain to the younger generation what the Holocaust was, and to change the narrative, because we keep discussing about the results of the Holocaust, the horrifying statistical figures. But we have to start speaking seriously about the sources of the Holocaust. How it started, because this is exactly what Marian Turski spoke about in Auschwitz-Birkenau, at that commemoration event. He didn’t speak about the past, he spoke about the present. How it can happen again. That it will be innocent at the beginning, slow and it will be driven by our passivity and our being indifferent. He warned very strongly against being indifferent. The last comment on your contributions on online hate speech. We have an agreement with the big players in the tech industry to remove hate speech, but it cannot be enough. There must be a ‘crime and punishment’ principle also online. That’s why I urged very strongly the law enforcement authorities in all the Member States to go after these cases and to show that it is not possible just to rely on the fact that, or the impression that, online has no law. We have to do much more. Law enforcement authorities have started to be more active. But what they keep telling me is that in Europe, in the 21st century, crime has no boarders, the digital area has no more borders and that law enforcement authorities are trapped by the national borders. And they cannot reach for the evidence of crime in another Member State. That’s why I wanted to ask you to look at again at the regulation on evidence which the Commission developed because if this is adopted, it will help a lot to go after crime wherever it happens in the EU.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 344, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Nikolina Brnjac", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, let me assure you once again that the Presidency and the Council as a whole rejects any form of anti-Semitism, racism and hatred.

As recalled by the EU’s strategic agenda, the rule of law is a key guarantee that our common values are well protected and complied with. Democracy, the rule of law and fundamental rights cannot be seen in isolation from one another. These elements are interlinked, interdependent and mutually reinforcing. One cannot exist without the others. It is a joint responsibility of the EU institutions and the Member States alike to ensure that respect for the rule of law is strengthened and that the rule of law remains the cornerstone of our common project. The independence of the judiciary is of crucial importance for the rule of law. It is also essential to ensure the application of EU law and the sound functioning of our common EU legal order. As regards the Article 7 procedure concerning Poland triggered by the Commission on 27 February 2018, as I had the opportunity to tell you when we discussed this topic at your January part-session, three hearings took place in June, September and December 2018 at the General Affairs Council. Subsequently the Council was kept regularly informed of the developments on the ground in Poland. Updates on the state of play were discussed at the General Affairs Council repeatedly in the course of 2019, in February, April, July, September and December.  The Council remains seized of this matter and our Presidency is ready to continue proceeding at the General Affairs Council.

Since then, the Commission has been in contact with the Polish authorities. Commissioner Reynders met a representative of the Polish Ministry of Justice on 24 January, and I visited Warsaw on 28 January.  At that occasion, I made the speakers of the Sejm and the Senate, the Minister of Justice, the First President of the Supreme Court of Poland, the President of the Constitutional Tribunal, and the Ombudsman. I carefully listened to the arguments of the Polish Government and explained to them the Commission’s stance. The Commission is committed and available to have an open and fair dialogue to resolve the issues at hand.  At the same time, the Commission will always fulfil its responsibility as the guardian of the Treaties. To that end, it will make use of infringement procedures whenever there are issues of compatibility with Union law. Likewise, the Article 7 process continues as long as the situation points to serious systemic threats to the rule of law.  At our last debate in this House, we informed you in particular about the draft new law governing the functioning of the judiciary. I explained that the draft legislation touches upon matters such as the independence of the judiciary, further raising the Commission’s concerns in this area. For this reason, I sent a letter to the Polish authorities on 19 December 2019. The letter recalled that the Commission wants to work with the Polish authorities to strengthen the rule of law by preventing problems and by working towards resolving them when they arise. I also invited all state organs not to take forward the proceedings on the new draft legislation before carrying out all the necessary consultations. On 16 January, the Venice Commission issued an urgent opinion on this new law raising serious concerns and recommending not to adopt it. On 24 January the new law on the judiciary was adopted by the Sejm, and on 4 February the President of the republic signed the law. This law raises a number of concerns as regards the rule of law. As noted by the Venice Commission, there is concern that this new law may further undermine judicial independence in Poland. It also raises concerns of compatibility with EU law and the Commission is now assessing these issues in detail. I can assure you that the Commission is committed to ensure the full respect of EU law and will take all necessary measures in that regard.  In addition to the adoption of the new law, a number of other developments took place. On 15 January, the Supreme Court issued two judgments implementing the preliminary ruling of the European Court of Justice regarding the independence of the disciplinary chamber. The Supreme Court confirmed the position taken in its ruling of 5 December 2019 and stated that the disciplinary chamber is not an independent court within the meaning of EU and national law.  Furthermore, in a resolution of 23 January the Supreme Court decided that the judges appointed at the request of the new national council for the judiciary, are not permitted to adjudicate cases. The resolution also invalidated all the rulings handed down by members of the disciplinary chamber. Another important development is the fact that the Constitutional Tribunal has been seized on the constitutionality of the approach on judicial independence that had been developed by the Supreme Court following the Court of Justice preliminary ruling on 19 November 2019. On 28 January 2020, the Constitutional Tribunal took an interim decision aimed at suspending the applicability of the Supreme Court’s resolution. As regards the disciplinary regime, you will remember that on 14 January the Commission decided to make a request for interim measures, asking the Court of Justice to order Poland to suspend the functioning of the disciplinary chamber. Meanwhile, I can only observe that the disciplinary chamber continues to operate. To conclude, I regret to say that these recent developments show that the situation is very serious. This is also reflected in the recent decision of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe to open a monitoring procedure over the functioning of Poland’s democratic institutions and the rule of law. At the same time, I want to reiterate that the Commission remains ready to continue a dialogue with the Polish authorities to solve the issues at hand. During my visit to Poland, the authorities expressed openness for having such dialogue both at political and technical level.  I trust that we can embark on an open discussion with Poland.

We are here because Polish citizens are Europeans too, and they are no less deserving of the same protection and the same rights as anyone in Sweden, Italy or Germany. Where every avenue for justice available to them on a national level has been blocked, neutered or taken over, then we will not shy away from playing our role. We are having this discussion now as a measure of last resort, as an appeal to the Polish Government to choose dialogue over confrontation, to choose justice over prejudice, and to choose European values over the failed populism of the past. I take no satisfaction in pointing out the irony of the fact that the last time the judicial system in Poland was under such pressure from the government was before 1989.  What this Polish Government has done is move to the past. They have used the same tired tactics of regression and oppression that fly in the face of everything Europeans have fought against and everything that Europe stands for today. But, if that is what the Government symbolises, then the brave judges stand for exactly the opposite and we look to those judges with respect and honour. Their bravery to their oath is a true symbol of the Polish courage that the world admires.  There are consequences to being an EU Member State. There are rules of this club that states agreed to follow. So now the Commission must use all the possible tools to immediately apply interim measures to prevent further repression, to protect the European way and to protect the Polish people. The disciplinary chamber, the ‘Muzzle Law’, the continued anti-European path of the Government means that Poland is drifting away and we are here extending a hand. Do not turn your backs on Europe.

I remember saying that the situation in Poland is unprecedented and that in fact never in the history of the EU has any Member State government exerted so much control over the judiciary. Now here we are, four weeks later, and the situation is even worse. Poland is now the first Member State where applying EU law can actually get judges fired. Worst of all, the Constitutional Court, which is supposed to be the ultimate guardian of checks and balances, is actually doing the Government’s bidding in its war on independent judges. Time is indeed running out because, if the Supreme Court is fully captured, which seems to be where we are headed, then it could spell the end of the separation of powers in one of our Member States. This is why the EU must indeed act.  As has been said, this is not to punish Poland or the Polish Government. This is for one simple reason: we must act to protect the civil and democratic rights of EU citizens, in this case Polish citizens. I often hear – and we’ll hear it here as well – that there’s a Western bias in our approach to Poland and that people in western Europe can’t understand the legal tradition and what it means to inherit the communist judiciary and try to reform it. So let me say, as a Slovak politician and as someone whose parents and family were actually persecuted by the communist judiciary, that judicial independence and rule of law is not a matter of legal tradition, but is a core constitutional principle of the European Union.

There is not only one way to build a democratic system; not all legal traditions in Europe are the same. But for all democratic systems there is a pre-condition, and that is that winning a majority does not mean that you can undermine rule of law and fundamental rights. I mentioned both of them, because actually both of these are currently under attack in Poland. The independence of the judiciary and thus the separation of powers, which is the cornerstone of rule of law instead of the law of the ruler, but also fundamental rights, especially of those from whom they are most easy to be taken away. I believe that in our reply in the future on the discussion under the Article 7 procedure and the mechanism on the rule of law and also in the future debate, we should take both of these dimensions into consideration. Poland is a country in the heart of Europe. Without Poland, this Union could never be complete. Polish citizens are indeed European citizens. So instead of blaming Brussels or the European Court of Justice or whoever they want for what is going on, the Polish Government should actually engage in an open and constructive dialogue to solve these very urgent and important problems. And I urge you, colleagues, to also bring this message to Poland. Colleagues, no matter where you stand in this debate, what we have seen in smear campaigns, in hate campaigns, also against Members of this Parliament in Poland in the past month and years, is absolutely unacceptable.

I therefore regret that the European Parliament is clearly presenting a political tone and is so openly calling for the instrumental use of the rule of law. Polish system of justice needs to be reformed. For the last four years Polish the government has been in accordance with the Constitution, within the competences defined by the EU treaties and in accordance with the expectations of poles, because they are our sovereign, such reforms are carried out. We have started reforming the justice system and we will complete this reform.  The fact is that there is a legal and political dispute in Poland, but the decision of the former belongs to Polish courts and tribunals, and the latter to Polish politicians. The judiciary is an area not covered by European Union law and the involvement of Parliament or the European Commission in these matters violates the fundamental principles of the Treaty of the Union. It is also worth noting that the reforms introduced are modelled on solutions already in place and never challenged by EU bodies in other Member States. For example, the provisions prohibiting judges from speaking of a political nature, which operate in France, or the appointment by politicians of judges in the Czech Republic or Germany, are not called into question.   The reform of the judiciary is expected by the majority of Polish society, and Polish the government is acting in its interest and not in the interests of the chosen social, professional or political group. We want to complete the reforms of the Polish judiciary and, in accordance with the Treaties, like every country in the Community, we have the right to do so. Today's debate unfortunately has a political dimension. I find no justification for doing so here.  We debated the rule of law in Poland here three weeks ago. At that time, no substantiated facts were identified to prove that the rule of law was being violated in Poland. Today we return to the topic. One might get the impression that the European Parliament wants to create such a fictional reality.  Commissioner Jourová was in Poland at the time. It has received assurances from the most important people in the country about the willingness to cooperate and willingness to dialogue, but for dialogue and cooperation to be possible, both sides must want them, and I have the impression that for now this readiness is only on the side of the Polish government.  For 4 years we have been explaining what has been in place for a long time in other countries of the European Union. We explain the reforms that are being implemented along the lines of those in other Member States. Poland is denied sovereign decisions under the treaties. Why is this happening? I leave the answer to this question to you, colleagues, because parliament seems to need to reflect not on what is happening in Poland, but on what is happening here. Consider why Poland is criticised for solutions you know from your own countries. Ask yourself why you are debating the competences that the EU treaties have given to national parliaments and not to us here. Finally, ask yourself if you want to continue to be used for political games that are not yours. Finally, is it not your duty to protect the European Parliament from being treated as a tool in an electoral fight in a Member State? An election campaign is underway in Poland. It is likely that the aim of the initiators of today's debate was to entangled Parliament in its course, thus wanting to influence the electoral outcome in Poland. The EU institutions should not meddle in the electoral process in any Member State. That is why I am turning to you, FELLOW MEPs, do not succumb to the political pressure of frustrated people who, in being incoup with a democratic choice, want to influence this outcome in this way. I can only apologise to you for those Polish politicians who do not understand that national political disputes that are being transferred to the EU arena are harming the Community. I am sorry about this and I just feel embarrassed about it.  Poland is a member of the European Union, but above all it is a sovereign country and as such has the right and duty Polish to care for the interests of the Community and the well-being of its citizens, and this is done by the government in accordance with the Polish Constitution, in accordance with the EU treaties. We are co-creating and co-responsible for the European Union like all the Member States and we want to be treated on the same terms.  I have said many times, also in the past as Polish Prime Minister, here in the European Parliament, and today I say this as an POLISH MEP, that Poland is a rule-of-law country and that the government is acting Polish in accordance with the Polish Constitution and the EU Treaties.

The experts strongly warned the Polish government against passing this law. What did we see last week? The Polish President signs precisely that law against all warnings. This has consequences for Polish society, and it also has very personal consequences. Just last week, the Disciplinary Chamber suspended Judge Pawe' Juszczyszyn from duty and reduced his salary by 40%. His misdemeanour - his alleged: He questioned the occupation of a panel appointed by the new pro-government National Judicial Council. The Judicial Council which Poland's Supreme Court has declared unlawful in accordance with a judgment of the ECJ. And by whom was he suspended? From the Disciplinary Chamber, which should also have been out of function for a long time. It, too, has been declared illegal by the Supreme Court of Poland, and the EU Commission has requested its immediate suspension to the ECJ. So you can see, in many small pieces of mosaic, that many, many small laws mean that the primacy of European law should no longer apply in Poland, and that the independence of the judiciary should no longer apply. We now need action from the Commission before the European Court of Justice and we must no longer allow cherry picking to take place.

First, as regards the new law (because there’s a new law since our last debate some weeks ago), I would like to assure you that the Commission is always open to a fair dialogue with Member States to solve problems but will not hesitate to use all the tools at its disposal to ensure the respect of EU law. The new law raises concerns of compatibility with EU law, including the principle of the primacy of EU law, the requirements of judicial independence under EU law, and the right to refer questions to the European Court of Justice. The Commission is analysing the law in detail, and in reply to comments from some Members, let me reiterate that the European Court of Justice ruled that until the organisation of justice in the Member States falls within their competence, the fact remains that when exercising that competence, the Member States are required to comply with their obligations under EU law. EU law requires respect for the rule of law, in particular judicial independence. This is crucial, because Polish courts are European courts and they have to ensure that Polish citizens can fully enjoy their rights under EU law. This is why I’m seriously concerned by the new law, and I can assure you, as Commissioner for Justice, that the Commission will take its responsibility as the Guardian of the Treaty and take all necessary measures to ensure the respect of EU law. I also note that the Disciplinary Chamber continues to operate, despite the rulings of the Supreme Court. In those rulings, following the Court of Justice judgment of 19 November, the Supreme Court concluded that the Disciplinary Chamber is not a court within the meaning of EU and national law. I would like to stress that preliminary rulings of the Court of Justice are biding and need to be fully respected. National courts must apply national law in line with the interpretation of the Court of Justice. Notably, on 4 February 2020, the Disciplinary Chamber decided to suspend in office the first judge seeking to apply the ruling of the Court of Justice of 19 November 2019. He has also been subject to a 40% reduction of his salary. The Supreme Court also ruled that the National Council for the Judiciary is not an independent and impartial body. However, the Council continues to operate. As an example, on 31 January it selected six candidates to the Disciplinary Chamber, two of which being current members of the National Judicial Council. In the light of today’s debate, let me say a few words on the situation of the Constitutional Tribunal. I want to recall that in its reasoned proposal of December 2017 triggering the Article 7 procedure, the Commission concluded that the independence and legitimacy of the Constitutional Tribunal are seriously undermined and consequently, the constitutionality of Polish laws can no longer be effectively guaranteed. I can only note in this respect that, following the rulings of the Supreme Court and the European Court of Justice judgment, the tribunal has been seized by a number of authorities. Your debate reminds me of statements warning that the current situation leads to legal chaos. I will simply reply that the remedy to such a situation is that rulings rendered by independent courts must be fully respected by all authorities. To conclude, let me add that the Commission is working on a comprehensive European rule of law mechanism. It will be a preventive tool covering all Member States and will provide a synthesis of significant developments related to the different components of the rule of law. It will be based on a variety of sources of information in order to reflect the reality on the ground. This will allow us to identify and prevent early on rule-of-law-related issues. This new mechanism will cover all Member States in the same way. The first annual Rule of Law Report is one of the key initiatives of the Commission Work Programme for 2020. The preparation of this report is already in an operational phase. We have established a network of contact persons of Member States which will help with its preparation. The report will also be part of the new rule-of-law cycle, with strong involvement of the European Parliament and the Council. However, let me be clear that this preventive mechanism does not replace response mechanisms like infringement procedures and the Article 7 procedure where they prove necessary. We will continue to use all the tools at our disposal to promote and protect the rule of law in all the Member States, including Poland.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 391, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Nikolina Brnjac", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, let me stress once again that the Presidency, and the Council as a whole, attach great importance to upholding the rule of law and protecting fundamental rights.

These are oral questions to the Commission and the Council and the subsequent motion for a resolution on the illegal trade in PET animals in the EU. I would like to say that we are building on the work of my colleague Renata Sommer from the previous period. Parliament has already made a number of resolutions in this area in the previous period, but words and the text of the resolution are not enough, and I think action is needed. I would therefore like to call on the Commission and the Member States to listen carefully and to come up with a rapid and effective response. This is a topic that is really important for anyone who is not indifferent to the suffering of illegally farmed animals. These are millions of damaged consumers and, of course, millions of damaged animals, also with regard to their well-being in which they are to be kept. Unfortunately, smugglers now have almost no obstacles in their way, and these smugglers make the most money from the status quo. This illegal animal trade is, ladies and gentlemen, the third most profitable illegal business after the sale of arms and drugs. A huge problem, especially in the countries of Central and Eastern Europe, are so-called breeding establishments, i.e. breeding establishments where dogs and cats are bred in appalling conditions with the prospect of fast and easy earnings. Unfortunately, consumers are also, of course, misled, who very often do not care about the origin of the animal at all, or even false documents are presented. Illegal breeders also use various very sophisticated tricks to entice potential buyers to buy a puppy or cat from a breeding house. Unfortunately, they very often hear about them precisely by getting a very quickly desired pet, and often at a lower price. Paradoxically, this is in a situation where dog shelters are overcrowded with other higher quality pieces. At the same time, it is necessary to prepare for illegal breeders, despite the tightening of the rules, to look for ways to circumvent these rules. If anyone is not convinced that animals sick or prone to diseases are released from the breeding plants, I recommend looking at neighbors across the Atlantic to the USA, where they are currently facing an epidemic of the disease, which is resistant to most antibiotics and which is currently associated with puppies from breeding plants. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in January that at least 30 people have also been given this highly infectious disease. To do this, it is important to remember that, in addition to the negative effects on the animals themselves, the illegal trade in pet animals also has, of course, wider implications, e.g. on our single internal market, consumer protection, which is just unknowingly buying a sick and traumatised animal.  We therefore call on the Commission and the Member States to develop strategies for regulating online advertising of pet animals in order to suppress misleading advertising and better control the online sales of cats and dogs. I think it is quite clear today that unethical treatment of pets is indeed a Europe-wide problem, which also requires a Europe-wide solution, the problem is indeed cross-border. Part of this solution should be the blanket and mandatory marking of pets, their shared records, thanks to which not only pets will be traceable to the store, but at the same time all stray animals, and also, of course, the tightening of breeding conditions. Of course, the suffering of animals in illegal breeding and subsequent transport across Europe, in which hundreds of thousands of puppies and kittens suffer every year, must also be put to an end. This cannot be avoided without rigorous controls, which, unfortunately, are currently toothless. It is the wild breeding houses in the houses of veterinarians that often do not reveal, there are, of course, only those registered breeding stations. There is a lot that needs to be done to improve the situation, so I appreciate the good negotiations with my colleagues. There is a proposal for some fundamental changes that would mark a major step forward in the fight against illegal pet breeding. I therefore appeal to the Commission and the Member States to really pay due attention to this problem and to speak out clearly and decisively in defence of those who cannot defend themselves.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 1, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 1, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 396, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Nikolina Brnjac", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, honourable Members of the European Parliament, in the recent years the illegal trade in companion animals has become a growing challenge for Member States’ competent authorities, and it has also raised concerns among EU citizens. The main difficulty relates to the abuse of the so-called ‘pet travel scheme’, the rapid development of online sales of companion animals and the risk associated with these activities. Indeed, we all know that illegal trade in pets may have negative consequences, not only in terms of public health and consumer protection, but also for animal welfare and animal health. I agree that this situation requires our full attention, and I can assure you that the Member States are fully aware of this problem. At the end of 2018, 17 Member States participated in an EU-coordinated control plan on the online sales of dogs and cats in order to gain insight into practices in this field. It turned out that a high percentage of the animals offered for sale was non-compliant. This confirmed the clear need to strengthen controls. I agree that identification and traceability of cats and dogs are key elements in this respect. The existing EU legislation already requires pet animals which are moved between Member States or imported into the EU to be marked. In addition, the new regulation on animal health and official controls offers further tools to fight illegal trade. Proper enforcement of the existing rules is of crucial importance. This is primarily the responsibility of the Commission and the Member States. I should also mention that since the adoption of the new regulation on animal health and official controls, the Council working party of Chief Veterinary Officers has intensively discussed how to better fight illegal trade in companion animals. These discussions highlighted the complexity of the problem and the need for continued cooperation between all competent authorities, including among Member States.

But in order to guide our discussion correctly, we need to start from the fact that the welfare of companion animals in the EU is mainly regulated at the national level. Member States have sole competence for cat and dog welfare, and they also have the sole responsibility for the identification, registration and conditions for keeping and moving these animals within their natural territory. EU rules cover cross-border trade in cats and dogs. Clear rules apply to both commercial and non-commercial movements and cover both animals moved within the EU and also those entering from the outside. These rules are mainly designed to protect animal health and prevent the spread of animal diseases, especially rabies. They also ensure any dogs and cats entering the EU or moved between countries are properly identified and vaccinated. Where illegal trade in cats and dogs is identified, it is therefore not due to a lack of legislation but because the legislation that is in place is not properly enforced by the Member States, and this is where we need to invest a lot more energy. In recent years we have tried to strengthen the legal framework to help Member States tackle illegal trade. The new Animal Health Law, which comes into force in April 2021, has made important changes. Firstly, it requires compulsory registration of all establishments breeding dogs and cats, and all transporters who take dogs and cats between Member States. Secondly, it obliges Member States to improve all shelters and assembly centres from which dogs and cats are moved to other Member States. These new measures will help to control trade of companion animals in a better way, and we consider that they are sufficient for tackling illegal trade. But again, it is crucial that these rules are properly applied and enforced, and for this we have taken several actions in Member States. The first of these is the EU coordinated control plan on the online sale of dogs and cats, this in order to give Member States insight into fraudulent practices and encourage them to control the online market more effectively. And the second is the voluntary initiative launched in the framework of the EU Animal Welfare Platform: the sub-group on health and welfare of pets, and this involves all relevant stakeholders and provides guidelines to ensure better animal health and welfare for companion animals. Thirdly, and finally: training provided for national authorities via the Better Training for Safer Food initiative, which encourages best practices to control imports and trade of dogs and cats. One element the new rules do not cover is the development of interconnected databases, and I believe that this is a question of proportionality. We consider that this would be disproportionate to the animal health risk without a clear indication of EU added value. We will, however – and I want to be clear on this – monitor the situation closely, continue working with Member States and stakeholders to ensure the illegal trade in cats and dogs in the EU is brought to an end.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 4, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 398, "date": "2020-02-11.json", "name": "Liudas MAŽYLIS", "mepid": "197841", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Madam President.

But it is also important that we enforce the rules, and I think we all need to understand that these are not being enforced. All the stakeholders have an important role to play in this by developing guidelines, and I was very interested and I agree that we need to also have more public awareness campaigns of this problem. The new Official Controls Regulation provides far stronger penalties and more tools to address online sales, and I believe that by working together we can stop the illegal trade of companion animals.
