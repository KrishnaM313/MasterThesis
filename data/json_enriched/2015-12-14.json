This weekend, there was a huge breakthrough in Paris that many did not think possible: a global, groundbreaking, forward-looking climate agreement has been agreed there! Global because for the first time all the countries of the world are taking part in the fight against climate change.  It is groundbreaking because all the states now recognise that we must remain well below two degrees of global warming, and they even want to try to limit the increase to a maximum of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  And it is a forward-looking agreement because we want to become a climate-neutral planet in the second half of the century. This means that we do not emit more greenhouse gas emissions than the earth can cope with. That is why Paris is certainly a turning point for the future of all of us. Above all, if we really implement the agreement that has now been rightly hailed. To do this, we need to change a lot – especially in the production of energy and in the consumption of energy.  A five-year monitoring mechanism was set up in Paris, which will give us feedback every five years on how we are moving forward and where we need to do more to achieve the objectives. The European Union must implement this agreement internally and externally and actually comply with the obligations of the agreement.  On behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank all those who have worked for years for the success of the Paris Conference. I would like to take this opportunity to thank you, Commissioner Arias Caete, on this day in this House for your work on this conference. We know that you worked intensively there! (Applause) However, I would also like to pass on this thanks to the Council. As we all know, the Luxembourg Minister for the Environment, Mrs Dieschbourg, has worked very closely with the Commission as President-in-Office of the Council.  I think I would like to thank the Executive Secretary, Mrs Figueres, but also the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Ban Ki-moon. Ladies and gentlemen, the French Government, which hosted these events and organised the conference, has done a tremendous job. This morning, assuming your agreement, I conveyed the thanks and congratulations of the European Parliament to the President of the Climate Conference, the French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, in a personal conversation and invited him to present the results here in Parliament, if he so wishes. Mr Fabius has accepted the invitation and would like to address the results of the conference in January. Once again, ifellows from all the groups in this House who were present at the conference and who contributed to their success, I would like to express my sincere thanks and congratulations.

Before I come to the individual days of the agenda, I would like to make a brief procedural communication to the House in order to make a request to you again in connection with this procedural communication. This is the report by Mr Grébarczyk on the Energy Union. It is an own-initiative report. I have had a total of more than 200 amendments to this own-initiative report, requests for a separate vote or requests for a split vote – more than 200. I asked the ENF Group, which tabled the largest proportion of the amendments, to reconsider whether all these amendments really needed to be tabled, otherwise I would have rejected the amendment and asked the committee to revisit the amendments. Thankfully, the group has withdrawn a number of the amendments, so that we now have a total of 59 amendments, but still 40 amendments to a separate vote and 44 amendments to a split vote. According to our estimate, you will be voting on this own-initiative report for about 45 minutes on Tuesday. We reduced it from about an hour and ten minutes to 45 minutes. At every plenary session, I receive strong criticism from your ranks that the votes take too long. You are right! I would therefore ask you to think again intensively about whether every split vote, whether every separate vote must actually be the same, whether every roll-call vote is really so necessary. They would give themselves some relief. Despite the clear breach of the minimum quo, I have now refrained from referring this report back to committee. However, if we have 200 to 300 amendments to own-initiative reports, I will continue to ask the committees to look again at such an enormous number of amendments, otherwise we will significantly exceed the voting time in plenary.

Marek thanks the shadow rapporteurs for their constructive cooperation and balanced compromises. They also believe that the amendments tabled in plenary will not fundamentally upset the balance to date.  Of course, we are pleased that the Commission is working intensively on the Energy Union project, so three weeks ago we were already informed here in plenary about the progress in implementation. Opinions on what the details of the Energy Union should look like differ, as the last debate has shown. And many of the arguments will surely be repeated again today. I would like to address some important elements, particularly from the point of view of the rapporteur, Mark Gróbarczyk. The Energy Union is to be based on a robust common energy market. However, where necessary, market-based instruments should be supported by solidarity mechanisms with Member States now largely dependent on one energy supplier. And these mechanisms should be strengthened as part of the revision of legislation, e.g. the Gas Security of Supply Regulation. In this context, the report expresses concern about the planned doubling of the capacity of the Nord Stream pipeline and the possible negative effects on energy security, diversification of supply and the principle of solidarity between Member States. The report also highlights the need to ensure long-term energy supplies through Ukraine. The Commission must guarantee full compliance with European Union competition law and energy legislation, including the third energy package. This also applies to future intergovernmental agreements between Member States and third countries. If the Commission had assessed in advance the consistency of all forthcoming agreements with European Union legislation, we could have avoided some controversy. The decarbonisation of the European Union economy must be properly managed. It must not lead to higher energy prices, energy poverty, deindustrialisation of the European economy or an increase in unemployment. At the same time, the exclusive right of Member States to choose the energy mix must be honoured. Reducing CO2 emissions should be a key objective, but it is up to the Member States to achieve this target. And to do this, they need as much flexibility as possible. In this context, I would like to stress that we must also respect nuclear energy as a low-carbon energy source essential for a number of countries. The report rightly calls for its support here as well. When I mention the objectives of the European Union, I see, of course, the sensitive issue of energy efficiency. The report does not call for binding targets for the Member States and I believe that this compromise reached in the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy will be maintained. Today I will not go into the details of COP 21, because tomorrow afternoon the plenary conclusions of the conference are on the agenda. The issue of electricity interconnection is addressed in detail in mr Eriksson's report. I would just like to underline the strengthening of national networks in order to avoid energy overflows through neighbouring states. As regards gas, the Gróbarczyk report highlights, in addition to inter connectors, the importance of LNG infrastructure and natural gas storage facilities. My colleague Gróbarczyk's report is very comprehensive and there is no time to discuss it further. I will therefore save some time for my colleagues and thank the shadow rapporteurs once again for their cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2015-12-14.json", "name": "Peter ERIKSSON", "mepid": "124937", "text": "   Rapporteur. Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating Mr I have to say, as the President said just now, that we have a global climate agreement at hand for the first time, and that is something that must strengthen all of us who have worked to find a solution to these difficult issues over the last ten to twenty years.  There is a process of revision and follow-up, and we have an agreement that says that we have a target that is well below two degrees. It is a great success. The question is what this means for the European Union. Yes, a few things are that we need to speed up the process of creating a common energy market and speeding up work on the Energy Union.  We need to remove subsidies on fossil fuels faster than we have imagined in the past. We also need to get a price on coal and ensure that we have a functioning ETS that is not yet working properly today, and we need to concentrate even more on energy efficiency in order to achieve the climate targets.  These are issues that come up in the Energy Union, but also part of my report that I have presented here and which deals with the interconnection of electricity networks in Europe. With common functioning electricity networks and a common market, we can achieve much of what we are striving for.  We can achieve cheaper electricity, cheaper electricity generation, cheaper electricity for consumers and businesses in Europe, and we can also have more renewable energy and more investment with a common functioning electricity market, and get more investment in renewable electricity where it is most efficient.  In places like the North Sea, we can get more wind energy produced. In Spain we can get more solar energy produced. With a larger interconnected electricity network and a common market, we can make this work together. The different renewable types of energy also tie each other together and balance each other in a better way. Then we can also more easily achieve the climate targets that we have now taken on. However, we can also achieve better competitiveness through cheaper electricity for European industry, and this is particularly important at a time when we still have very high unemployment in many countries. If we get rid of the energy islands that we still have in Europe, for example in Poland, in the United Kingdom, spain and the Iberian Peninsula, then it also makes a major contribution to strengthening competitiveness and European industry.  I think one goal is not enough for the future. We need to add regional targets to remove the bottlenecks in the electricity networks and we also need to strengthen the supervisory authority ACER with better budgets, more staff and better opportunities to exercise its supervision and control.  Finally, we also need to make greater efforts to introduce the best available technology BAT (Best Available Technology) when we invest and invest in new electricity grids.

Both projects certainly have a balanced and inclusive approach and underline the need for the Energy Union to be ambitious in its five dimensions, to make its progress verifiable and quantifiable and for this process to be transparent.  The Commission fully agrees with these three elements, as already illustrated by the report on the State of the Energy Union adopted by the College a month ago and which was presented to this House by Vice-President Eef-Soviet, who has been encouraging and coordinating our action in this important priority for the European Union. I would like to focus my speech on these three issues.  Firstly, the need to maintain the energy union's levels of ambition. I have just returned from Paris, where over the past two weeks the European Union, with its allies, has led the negotiations to reach the most ambitious climate agreement in history.  But the implementation of that agreement begins from today. That means we have to meet our goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 1990 levels; we need to achieve a 27% share of renewable energy and improve energy efficiency by 27% by 2030 with a 30% view.  As far as renewable energy is concerned, we already have a 15% share in the European Union, but we need to increase our efforts to make the 2030 target a reality. And that is why we will have to address the revision of the Renewable Energy Directive scheduled for the second half of 2016.  As regards energy efficiency, let me reiterate that the Commission is already considering how we could increase the target to 30%, as requested by this draft report. The Energy Efficiency Directive is also the worst being implemented. That is why we will have to make sure that it is fulfilled in all Member States.  But we also need to increase our level of ambition. That is why, next year, I will present a set of proposals related to energy efficiency in sectors such as heating and cooling, buildings and transport and industry emissions.  In addition, I believe that a transition to a low-carbon economy should be guided by innovation and the European Strategic Energy Technology Plan will be critical.  The second issue I want to talk about today is the need to measure our progress, which is linked to the Eriksson report on the 10% electricity interconnection target by 2020. Today, only twenty Member States achieve these objectives and for some, such as the Iberian Peninsula, the Baltic States or Cyprus, electrical interconnection is clearly insufficient. In addition, lack of interconnection is an impediment to ensuring the integration of renewable energy into our energy matrix and achieving higher competitiveness quotas. We will start in 2015 with an inauguration and a new electrical interconnection through the Pyrenees, and today we have inaugurated the new electrical interconnections between Lithuania and Poland, and between Lithuania and Sweden. Both LitPolLink and NordBalt will be key to ending the energy isolation of the Baltic States.  And we have just adopted a second list of projects of common interest containing the most important interconnection priorities for the European Union: 108 electricity projects that will enable twenty-six Member States to achieve the 10% interconnection target by 2020.  But going back to the draft report we are discussing today, I am particularly pleased with the ambition it shows by including the longer-term target of 15% by 2030.  I announce that I will propose the establishment of a group of energy infrastructure experts to monitor progress in the 10% target and make proposals if the target is not met, as well as to advise the Commission on how to achieve the 15% target.  One of the central pillars of next year's legislative proposals will be the design of the electricity market for greater market integration.  Strengthening ACER's role and promoting closer regional cooperation, as indicated in the draft report, will be key features of market design proposals, and that will be of cardinal importance for energy security.  As the draft Gróbarczyk report highlights, we have made significant progress in diversifying gas sources and gas routes.  The next package on security of supply, which includes a review of the gas supply safety regulation and a proposal to review the decision on intergovernmental agreements will help us go further. And that's important because many countries rely heavily on Russian gas imports.  And on that issue, let me respond to the concerns about NordStream 2 raised in the draft report.  First of all, I have to say that it is clear that this project, like any other, will have to fully respect European Union law. Secondly, I would like to stress that the Commission will support only those projects which are in line with the objectives of the Energy Union, including energy security. And, in this context, diversification of supply sources, routes and suppliers is key.  Finally, I would like to clarify that the European Union continues to see Ukraine as a safe and necessary transit country. I will make sure Parliament is informed of any developments.  And in this spirit I address my last point: the need to be held accountable. The State of the Energy Union made it clear that the Energy Union can only function if it is based on a reliable and transparent process anchored in the legislation.  Over the next few years, we will propose a number of legislative proposals on the five dimensions. And here Parliament, as co-legislator, will play a decisive role.  In addition to this, of course, we need a robust governance process, as highlighted in the draft report on the Energy Union. As many of you have pointed out, this process would not make sense if it became a mere bureaucratic process. That is why next year we will propose an initiative on simplifying planning and reporting so that, after 2020, Member States will develop an integrated national energy and climate plan; that the monitoring system should be based on a report on the progress made by Member States; and for the Commission to assess collective progress in an annual comprehensive state of the European Union.  In this context, the powers of this Parliament will be fully respected. Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude by saying that the Commission welcomes these two draft reports.

Our aim is to strengthen security of supply and increase energy efficiency at an affordable price. This requires, where necessary, the building of new infrastructure, further unifying the market and forcing the application of legislation.  At the end of the road, we hope, is a Europe capable of increasing its competitiveness on the international stage. A Europe in which new jobs are created, for example through technological research and development, the promotion of innovations or, for example, investments in energy efficiency. This journey will be a long one, there is a lot of work to be done here in Parliament, and in order to walk the road, we legislators must always be ready to compromise. A good example of this is the report under discussion.  On the one issue, I particularly welcome the compromise on the extraction of mineral resources within Europe's borders. I am glad that we agree that it is not parliament's responsibility to decide what is economical, what is not, what has potential and what does not. That will be decided by the players in the economy.

This Parliament is saying its opinion on the Energy Union, that is to say on the most ambitious strategy for the integration of European energy markets since that first courageous and somewhat visionary project: the European Coal and Steel Community. Well, more than sixty years after the context and the world have changed a great deal, but the issue always remains the same: guaranteeing the energy security of the Member States, as a factor of stability, competitiveness and growth of their territories, with an additional challenge, the capital challenge, that of climate and sustainable development. It is therefore in this spirit that we are going to vote, after weeks and months of negotiations, on the basis of a solid text to which almost all the groups have contributed and which place this House at the centre of the debate on the future of the Energy Union. I believe that there are two main points: the call for strong governance, with full ownership of Parliament in the ordinary legislative procedure and essential objectives – the second point – that we Socialists and Democrats, together with others, want even more ambitious in terms of efficiency so that the energy transition is courageous and socially sustainable.  Parliament is therefore returning to the field, ready to make its voice heard on the dense path of building the Energy Union, with the commitment shown in recent months by the Commission in ferrying the Energy Union stage by stage and the obstinacy of this House in seeking broad understandings of the basic objectives, as conditions for important results, towards a single, harmonious and fair European energy area.

Mr Arias Cañete, you are bringing to us gifts from Paris and I think that should be in the forefront of all our minds.  What we have seen in Paris is perhaps more important because of the ambition it represents: 1.5°C  as an ambition is significant. What does it mean for us now? We must do some of the underpinning research and understand the implications for all our policies; not just those on the Union, but across every single one of our targets. We need to look at what that ambition can represent and should represent. I should pay tribute to my colleague, Mr Gróbarczyk, who has gone back to Poland to work on fisheries, the poor bugger. It will be more difficult working on fisheries than energy, I suspect. The reality, however, is that the Energy Union must be the beating heart of the European continent. If it is, we can make significant progress. Right now, by combining each of our states’ ambitions we can interlink and we can make that difference happen. Interconnectivity is important and we must make sure that it actually works. I believe the North Sea is a place where we can see that ambition in reality and I will push again, Mr Arias Cañete, for you to realise that the North Sea is good to go and ready to go. Let us interlink that basin and let us see that progress in reality. Let it be a beacon for the rest of the EU so that we can make some substantial progress.

On governance, a clear emphasis should be given to Parliament’s role in this process and the need for Member States’ progress on implementation to be carefully scrutinised. I am also happy that we have laid the groundwork for taking a more holistic and, in my view, ambitious approach to the integration of energy systems and solutions.

Mr President, the energy union strategy will have a decisive impact on people's lives. That is why we have a responsibility not to adopt as Parliament's positions the negative policies and incomplete proposals promoted by the Commission. It is not enough to say that unemployment and poverty must be combated. We must support a development social policy that ensures energy as a public social good, to which we will all have equal access. To achieve this, we must ensure that energy remains outside the TTIP agreement and that the Commission is not given powers at the expense of the sovereign rights of states.  We must then stop talking vaguely about removing the energy isolation of states and promote investment in interconnections and public infrastructure of strategic importance, for the benefit of the people. Equally important is to stop simply noting how domestic energy sources should be exploited and to support, inter alia, the creation of a Mediterranean gas hub in the Mediterranean, with the potential to develop LNG. Finally, we must stop funding nuclear energy and promote a realistic integrated strategy to implement the 2020 and 2030 renewable energy targets.

The second, renewable energy: right, the spirit of departure in Paris, more than 100 multinational companies that are in favour of 100% renewable energy.

Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to thank the commissioner for her work and for the work she has The Paris Climate Agreement provides for a well-below two-degree global warming and to achieve greenhouse gas neutrality by 2050. The Europeans have made a binding commitment to this, and many other countries are not.  The report on the Energy Union under discussion today is of great importance because, through the mix of measures it sets out, it enables many Member States to achieve these reduction targets or to move closer to these reduction targets. In essence, this is about measures to reduce CO2 emissions, increase the share of renewable energy in the energy mix and improve energy efficiency, primarily of buildings and transport, and the TRAN Committee was therefore involved.  It is therefore a question of reversing the trend in energy policy: moving away from fossil fuels and nuclear energy, away from centralised market models and dirty generation technologies, towards a sustainable, resource-efficient economy, more competition and greater consumer involvement.  How do we want to achieve this? By increasing energy supply – certainly, as has already been mentioned today – greater diversification, more energy diplomacy and better cooperation in the field of electricity supply. By developing energy infrastructure – as Mr Eriksson's report shows today – in particular, network expansion to increase interconnectivity – 10% by 2020, 15% by 2030 – the development of networks and decentralised generation and new storage facilities, as well as more funding for research and development, innovation in the energy sector.  The strategic focus is on lowering energy prices, creating decentralized feed-in opportunities, creating greater energy security – i.e. reducing the risk of blackout – and creating a better funding opportunity for new technologies and green jobs.

I would like to thank Mr Saunders. I would also like to thank Mr Eriksson for bringing together a broad majority in Parliament for the report, but also to my colleagues in the EPP Group for their firm support for the report. Better interconnting will mean better security of supply and cheaper consumer electricity prices for our citizens and for our businesses in Europe. With lower electricity prices, our businesses become more competitive, and that is what we need: to create growth and create jobs in Europe. Too many young people in southern Europe are without jobs today, which is why we need to increase competitiveness so that we can also compete on the world market.

It is because it is important to combat the energy dependence that larstrastras our economy; it is because it is important to combat climate change by boosting renewable energy; and it is because we need to democratize energy and make it reach consumers at an affordable price. This requires making more Of Europe, ensuring the minimum 10% interconnection, and ending the energy islands. This is reflected in the Council Conclusions, the Commission Communication and the position of the European Parliament; even the Treaty itself reflects the necessary solidarity that must be in the Union's energy policy.  Therefore, all these agencies call for all necessary efforts to achieve this necessary 10%. In that regard, I would have liked the Eriksson report to have been perhaps clearer, with a closer defence of that 10%. Because I think it not only does not defend, but questions, 15%, and introduces the necessary scientific and technical assessment of this 10%.  In this regard, I would like to recall and stress that this is a political and non-scientific or technical objective. That is why I would have liked a much clearer strategy to end these energy islands that are so necessary to this day.  This contrasts with the report on 'Towards a European Energy Union', which sets out a clear defence of this 10% minimum; I also believe that this report, although it contains aspects which the Socialist Group of course cannot share, is a good report in the sense that it contains many other proposals which I consider innovative and important, such as support for the self-consumption of renewables and consumer prominence in energy management.  In short, in order to achieve greater consistency, I call for the support of the three amendments contained in the texts of the Commission, the Council and the European Parliament in this regard.

Another problem is that it gives too much power to the Commission. It defends a liberal ideology and, as a result, is not in a position to ensure energy security since its price vision does not support the market in the long term. This liberal view of prices leads to a total contradiction because you are asking for both lower prices and additional investment. One wonders how we will finance additional investments with prices that do not ensure their profitability. The Commission must not have bargaining power.

In order for it to provide us with a high security of supply, I think we really need to work on interconnections. We have, of course, existing interconnections. They need to be strengthened and used to the maximum of their capacity, but that is not the only solution; nor is the only solution to develop more and more infrastructure. It is important to evaluate each new project very rigorously, to examine its feasibility and also to take into account future developments so as not to hinder projects that might be promising. It is also important that we have cost-benefit analyses to compare the different projects. The second solution is to ensure that investors benefit from a favourable framework for sustainable investment and more long-term contracts in the electricity market in order to secure and encourage investments, particularly in favour of renewable energy, which have very high fixed costs.

The two initiative reports, 'Towards a European Energy Union' and 'Achieving the 10% Electricity Interconnection Goal', present important elements for creating a safer, sustainable and competitive energy market. Proposed measures, such as the creation of a modernisation fund, additional consumer protection measures, support for regional cooperation projects between electricity and gas distribution system operators are important objectives. At the same time, given that small and medium-sized enterprises and European industry are vital to the European Union's economy and competitiveness, we must ensure that the proposed objectives and targets will not be met to the detriment of European industry and jobs. It is the Member States that need to set their own energy mix, with the achievement of all the targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions, energy efficiency and renewable energies. We are concerned that there are Member States that are far from meeting their 2020 targets. Given the current context regarding our energy dependence on certain external factors, the achievement of a fully integrated internal market, security of supply, energy efficiency and the optimal use of the European Union's energy resources, as well as research and innovation, would maximise the benefits for new industries and new technologies, while ensuring protection and support for traditional labour and industries. In view of the role of interconnectivity in the completion of the Internal Market of the European Union, I stress the importance of the 10% electricity interconnection target, for which it is necessary to urgently mobilise all efforts at all levels and mobilise financial resources.

After all, no one knows what is needed better than those countries themselves, because they have years of experience in this, and the Treaty is clear in this. It is explicitly stipulated that the European Union must not interfere in the exploitation of a Member State's energy sources, including the choice of a Member State's energy sources, nor the structure of its energy supply. However, the European Commission has come up with plans for a joint energy union, which must focus on poverty reduction and climate change in addition to energy.

The whole project has a number of objectives, but I would like to highlight only two, those which I consider to be the core of the whole project and according to which the success of the Energy Union will be measured. The first is that the Energy Union will be a success if we can get rid of fossil fuel dependency in the next three, four or five decades. We need to create a framework where not only businesses, manufacturers, but also consumers, science and research can make appropriate decisions. But a much more immediate problem is to fulfil the essence of solidarity between Member States. And if we have a problem, it is the lack of solidarity, or perhaps the absence of it at all.  A concrete example is the expansion of the Nord Stream pipeline, the so-called Nord Stream 2 project. Without interest in, without consulting and circumventing the Member States and their partners, this is not solidarity between Member States, in my opinion.

It is clear that integration has to take place at the regional level, that integration has to be produced through this type of interconnections for those countries, as the rapporteur himself and other Members have said, that they are more disconnected, further away, that they are more islands. That is why it is striking that this political decision of 10% is classified as a lack of scientific basis. This doesn't really make any sense.

Commissioner! Finally, an international climate agreement was reached. Finally, we have succeeded in committing the world to a showdown with fossil fuels. After all, one of our most visionary projects in this showdown is our own project here in the EU: the Energy Union is a fantastic vision, a strong framework for our climate and energy goals. But without effective regulation to be put into that framework, we will never achieve the goals!  We know from our own energy regulator, ACER, that in 70% of cross-border electricity connections in Europe, less than half – less than half – of available capacity is used. We therefore have cables, literally, both at sea, on land and in the air, and we have an increasing share of renewable energy, yet green energy is all too rarely reaching across borders between EU countries. Instead, local coal and gas power stations are just a little more fired up, and that is not a very green sustainable future.  ACER has given us a clear picture of the situation with its annual market report, and the conclusion is clear: energy is there, the capacity is there, cooperation between countries is fundamentally lacking. Artificial and real energy bottlenecks are a daily obstacle to the green transition and a gift to the old, polluting power stations. It is time for the Commission to address this problem, give ACER the cross-border skills they need and ensure that we do not just have an energy union in the EU, but a climate and energy union.

It is inconceivable that the European Union should be so energy dependent that it needs over EUR 1 billion each year to meet its energy needs from energy imports.

But energy detoxification and the Energy Union will not materialise if the European Union itself does not fulfil its potential, wherever they are.  I will refer to our example of Cyprus. Natural gas reserves have been found in the Eastern Mediterranean and there is now a strong alliance between Cyprus, Greece, Israel and Egypt, of an energy nature, which the Energy Union can exploit.

Mr President, energy security, adequacy and the lowest possible price are for consumers, throughout Europe, the demands of what we are discussing today, the Energy Union. What can we do about it? Firstly, we must encourage the construction of networks in South-Eastern Europe, where my country, Greece, is located, and support, through the Connecting Europe Facility but also the European Fund for Strategic Investments of the Juncker package, efforts to move the links forward immediately, not only with Italy, but also with countries such as Turkey and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It is important for the European Union to lead this initiative, because this will increase energy security.  Secondly, the internal market and competition must operate in each Member State, since the energy mix falls within national policy and since clean technologies are necessary. In my country, Greece, there is an issue with private access to all energy sources. Private producers do not have equal access to lignite, so at the moment they are favoured because of low oil prices vis-à-vis PPC, but in the end competition does not work and consumers pay for it.

Let me, however, make a little clarification: some Member has suggested that, in developing the Energy Union, the Commission was invading the competences of the Member States. Nothing further, Mr President, from reality. It was the European Council which asked the Commission to put in place all the rules to ensure that the European Union is a security of energy supply, energy production in a sustainable manner and to have energy at competitive prices.  Let us not deceive ourselves, we have security of supply problems in two ways: on the one hand, we have a very strong dependence on single suppliers in the gas sector – and that is why the European Commission has supported the Southern Corridor – and on the other hand there is all the realization of interconnections in the eastern Mediterranean, in the Baltic countries... we also try to connect the Iberian Peninsula to the gas markets... And that is why the European Council set policy objectives, which have been said in this House, of 10% and 15% in electricity markets. It is impossible to develop an internal market without physical interconnections. Then, much more needs to be done: energy charging systems, renewable energy support systems must be harmonized; enormous harmonization and integration must be made. But there is one very clear fact: when there is regional integration, competition increases and consumers benefit. When there are no connections, we rely on external suppliers and set prices from outside. That is why, on the gas market, in addition to interconnections, the Commission wants to launch a liquefied natural gas strategy, so that there are other alternative sources.  And that's why in the electricity market we work on a double front: improving interconnections, but also redesigning the electricity market so that we have smart networks, effective interconnection systems, more harmonized charging systems, and we can move from having 28 distinct electricity markets to aiming, in the first phase, for more powerful regional integration and, in the end, definitive integration.  But, in addition to this process of developing the energy union, we are in the midst of a great global climate agreement, for which the European Union presented the most ambitious objectives, both in reducing greenhouse gases, as well as energy efficiency and renewables.  But those are the goals we have today. In Paris we have designed a system to progressively raise our level of ambition; today we are on a path not towards both degrees but towards three degrees. That is why, in 2018, we will assess together where we are and in 2020 all parties to the Convention will be asked to say whether they increase their level of ambition or confirm what they have. And, in 2023, we will repeat this exercise.  But there's a fact that's very clear. All countries in the world are moving in the same direction: greater development of renewables, greater energy efficiency and better management of their forest masses. And that's an unstoppable process. What the Commission wants is to prepare the European Union for this process, with the best legislation, with the greatest ambition.  We have to make our prices no longer twice as high as those of our competitors in electricity, or three times as much in gas. And that is why the Commission is not going to spare any means. For this and for us to be a reliable part of this great Paris agreement that fulfils its commitment to reduction, that improves its energy competitiveness and that has a market where consumers benefit.

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all colleagues and their staff, both in Parliament and the Commission. I would also like to warmly thank the many Presidencies that have worked on this dossier, and perhaps most importantly the Italian and the Latvian Presidencies, which provided excellent work in the most critical stages of the negotiations. I would like to draw your attention to the achievements on this file. The reforms agreed in trialogues will ensure that companies in Europe have faster and cheaper access to trademarks, both at national and European levels, without compromising on the quality of the decisions. Administrative procedures have been streamlined according to best practices, and we will see an increased harmonisation of the national systems along the lines of best practices. On substantive trademark law, we have modernised a number of provisions in view of technological developments. We have also managed to include important safeguards to protect freedom of expression by limiting the possibility of rightholders to bring legal actions against people using trademarks for reasons, for example, of parody or artistic expression. For this, I would like to thank an old colleague from Sweden who was with us but who is not any more. He drew our attention to this.  Some of you might have received letters during the week from NGOs expressing concerns on the issue of transit of generic medicines to developing countries. I would very much like to underline the position and the fact: I can assure everyone that there will in no case be any problems for the transit of generic medicines to developing countries as a result of this legislation. Throughout my life I have fought for development, and I would never, ever allow a law bearing my name to hinder people in developing countries from getting access to medicines. That is for sure. The ambition has been shared by the entire Parliament negotiating team. We have been united in this, and together we managed to include very strong safeguards. It should also be noted that the problems that have occurred in past times with regard to the transit of medicines have exclusively related to patents, and not trademarks. I am proud today of the balance that we have achieved between fighting organised crime and the dangerous trafficking of counterfeit products, and protecting the interests of legitimate trade. I would like to stress that there is no risk of confusion between generic medicines and counterfeit, fake medicines. Any holder of a European trademark trying to incorrectly stop goods in transit which are not breaching the rights is also liable for damages in accordance with the EU customs regulations. These rules will give our customs officers the right to seize counterfeit fake products transiting through Europe. Now, in Europe, we will be able to help developing countries in an important struggle against organised crime, which preys on the most vulnerable of us. This is something that we are all united in.

Both this work and the very constructive spirit that I observed in the negotiations facilitated reaching an agreement after more than two years of complex discussions.  Regardless of its apparently technical character, the trade mark reform package constitutes a key element for the EU’s competitiveness and innovation strategy. The reform package will foster innovation and growth by making the trade mark registration system all over the EU more accessible and efficient for businesses, whether in terms of lower cost, increased speed, more predictability or legal certainty. The clear benefits of the compromise package are there for all to see. The package marks a significant step in both the modernisation and the further harmonisation of the trade mark system in Europe. Allow me now to highlight just a few of these benefits. Firstly, the agreed fee reductions at European Union level will lead to savings of up to almost 40%, in particular for businesses that seek protection of the registered EU trademarks beyond an initial period of ten years.  Secondly, the reform of the directive will ensure more streamlined, efficient and harmonised registration procedures across all trademark offices in the European Union. Faster and less burdensome procedures will constitute a great improvement for growing companies, mainly SMEs, which roll out their business beyond one Member State and are seeking trade mark protection. The arrangements for common application requirements and the future availability of administrative opposition and cancellation procedures at national level are a good illustration of this.  Thirdly, trade mark owners in the EU will have better tools to fight against counterfeit goods, in particular when these illegal imitations are in transit through the EU’s territory. This will help prevent abuse of the Union and its transit routes in its role as a central hub for the worldwide distribution of such goods. At the same time there will be appropriate safeguards in the interest of legitimate trade.  And fourthly, the reform will bring modernised rules and increased legal certainty by adapting trade mark rules to the modern business environment and clarifying trade mark rights and their limitations. In relation to the regulation regarding the procedure of preselection and appointment of an executive director of the Agency in Alicante that is responsible for administering the EU trade mark system, it has to be stressed from the Commission’s point of view that the final text is not aligned with the principles of the EU’s interinstitutional common approach on decentralised agencies. Notwithstanding this shortcoming and also the fact that key elements of the Commission’s proposals concerning the budget were not retained, the final text of the regulation will nevertheless bring about major improvements in the governance and accountability of the Agency.

It has taken almost three years for the Committee on Legal Remedies, as well as other Members of this House, to work on this great reform in order to actually introduce the necessary and necessary changes to the trade mark protection system in the European Union. The final success is undoubtedly a great credit to our rapporteur Cecilia Wikström, who has fought steadfastly for clearer and clearer rules, above all for trade mark owners. And this is a huge success. Much has been said here about the fight against counterfeiting, but this reform brings about other significant changes, such as cheaper and simpler trade mark registration, a clearer register of trade marks and clear rules on refusal of registration. These are extremely important issues. The most important thing, however, is that the common new rules that have just been prepared are effective, because if they are ineffective, it will only be a half-success. Therefore, the rules to prevent the appearance of counterfeits on the market, i.e. closer cooperation between national patent offices and, as well as between those offices and the EU agency, are key to the final success of introducing a modern and efficient EU trade mark system. Dear! The Committee on Legal Affairs takes a broader approach to the whole issue. At the moment, we are finishing work on the protection of trade secrets. We are starting work on copyright reform.

That is why our key objectives through this legislation have been related to public health, protecting jobs and defending fundamental rights.  I am pleased that the European Parliament has managed to reduce red tape by using this mechanism, increasing efficiency, but also reducing costs by up to 37%. The new regulations reduce the possibility of exceptions that may lead to abuse, but also allow for better coordination on products in transit. The generalisation of this system at European level will help beneficiaries. The fact that revenue balancing has been envisaged for the national trade mark bodies will increase the fairness of the European system.  In my country, I must say, Romania, consumers, therefore citizens, are unfortunately often misled by counterfeit products. That is why it is essential for the European Union to step up information and communication campaigns aimed at both citizens and companies – I am referring here in particular to SMEs – who are keen to secure trade mark protection.

Mr President, the trademark protection system should be simple, inexpensive and flexible enough to give users access to protection that corresponds to their needs.

For this reason, trademark protection at national level must be maintained at the same time. This means establishing a complementary relationship between the Union and national trademark protection systems. In this context, the principle of territoriality, legal certainty and clarity must be guaranteed, both in the case of similarity and in the case of the use of an identical trade mark for identical products.

The agreed reform would lead to a modernised, more efficient legal framework. This will promote entrepreneurship and competitiveness; which is certainly good for Europe.  We will also be better equipped to fight against counterfeiting. This is essential to help reduce its detrimental effect on health, on safety and of course on innovation and growth. Let me at this point also stress, and it is important to note, that the agreed compromise concerns trade marks only. It does not have any connection with patents or legal generic medicines. Nevertheless, the agreed package provides for appropriate safeguards to guarantee the smooth transit of generic medicines across the Union. Some of you referred to this.  I therefore commend this package to the European Parliament and I ask you for your strong support for this.

The trademark-based industry accounts for 21% of all jobs and 34% of the Union's total GDP, according to a study last year by OHIM and the European Patent Office. Consequently, trade marks are currently one of the most important market instruments determining the position of the product designated on the market. A trade mark confers on its holder an exclusive right under which it may prohibit third parties from using it in the course of trade.  The reform of the trade mark system aimed at modernising the current system to keep pace with an ever-growing market for the benefit of all users, stimulating innovation and economic growth by increasing accessibility for businesses.

Increased cooperation between national and European legislation will be a plus; (b) a significant reduction in the taxes payable when registering trademarks - the reduction in these costs could be as much as one third of the current cost; c) speeding up and simplifying procedures, which will make life easier for businesses, especially SMEs.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 121, "date": "2015-12-14.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   The next item is the Commission statement on the protection of victims of terrorism (2015/3019(RSP)).", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 122, "date": "2015-12-14.json", "name": "Ryszard CZARNECKI", "mepid": "28372", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, the recent attacks in Paris revealed once again the radical face of terrorism. We know that over the past decade several Member States have been targeted and experienced tragic losses. Let me mention all of them: Spain, Estonia, the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands, Greece, Sweden, Germany, Italy, Norway, Bulgaria, Belgium and Denmark.  The 2012 Victims’ Rights Directive that entered into application in the Member States last month is the major general instrument on victims’ rights at EU level. It lays down a set of binding rights for all victims of crime, including rights to protection, support and assistance that take into account the individual needs of every victim of crime. It does not, however, provide the specific measures that would respond directly to the needs of victims of terrorism. Terrorist attacks leave behind individuals who have been injured, traumatised or lost their lives as a result of the attack. The victims of such attacks require specific protection, support and assistance that would respond to their specific needs related to the nature of this crime. That is why the Commission decided to introduce specific provisions on victims of terrorism to the proposal for a directive on combatting terrorism of 2 December. The main objective is to oblige the EU Member States to criminalise terrorist offences and offences related to terrorism such as travel and training for terrorist purposes and financing of terrorism without, however, forgetting about the victims of terrorism.  This proposal responds more precisely to the needs of victims of terrorism. In particular, the proposed directive requires Member States to ensure that victims of terrorism receive immediate access to professional specialist support services providing for physical and psycho-social treatment. Such support will be available for as long as necessary.  Terrorist attacks often result in chaos and disinformation, and access to reliable information for victims of terrorism and about victims of terrorism is therefore crucial. The proposed directive requires that the support services provide access to such reliable information. Under the proposed directive, the competent national authorities would be required to cooperate closely to ensure that all victims of terrorism are well informed and receive the necessary support and assistance, independently of where in the European Union they live. The tailored rules on protection, support and assistance to the victims of terrorism will add to the healing process of the victims and their families, and thus indirectly to the healing process of the whole society. This is also at the heart of our Radicalisation Awareness Network (RAN) Centre of Excellence connecting over 2 000 practitioners across the Union and supporting them in addressing radicalisation. The RAN Centre of Excellence, which became fully operational on 1 October this year, has been endowed with EUR 25 million for the next four years to empower practitioners on the ground. These practitioners come from different backgrounds, including representatives from local authorities, from the community and local police, prison and probation officers, social and health workers, teachers, civil society organisations, security officials and, last but not least, victims groups and associations. Victims of terrorism deserve our solidarity and support. They also have a very prominent role to play in countering radicalisation. Their testimonies can provide a crucial contribution in preventive work. Within the RAN, a specific working group on the remembrance of victims of terrorism has been set up. It will be instrumental in organising the 11 March Remembrance Day for the victims of terrorism in 2016. Since the Madrid bombings in 2004, the Commission has been commemorating the European Remembrance Day of victims of terrorism on 11 March exactly, and will continue to do so with the support of the RAN. The event will allow us to remember and honour those who have suffered and help the healing process of those who continue to suffer. Furthermore, with the help of the RAN we will make sure that the voices of the victims are heard and are openly and widely heard, especially among radicalised youth, as the stories and suffering of victims must never be in vain. These voices should make those individuals on the brink of extremism think twice before they act. I am particularly convinced of the important role victims can play in counter-narrative campaigns as well as, for example, in prison and probation. We will make sure that their experiences and stories can have a powerful but positive influence on individuals at risk or already radicalised.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "ECR", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 123, "date": "2015-12-14.json", "name": "Teresa JIMÉNEZ-BECERRIL BARRIO", "mepid": "96806", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, it is very difficult to accept that anyone can be a victim. I had to accept it when the terrorist organization ETA murdered my brother and his wife. Since then, I have defended the rights of all victims. It doesn't matter if those who shoot do so on behalf of a so-called Islamic State or an independent Basque state. For me, there is no God or land worth the life of an innocent.  The Spanish Law on The Recognition and Comprehensive Protection of Victims of Terrorism says that victims should be recognized as a symbol of the democratic state's defence against the terrorist threat, and the Law in Spain refers not only to material measures, but also moral measures.  Terrorism strikes in all states of the Union. But not all states have laws to support victims; That is why a European Directive on the protection of victims of terrorism is indispensable. The needs of victims are summarized in four: the right to justice, truth, memory and dignity. And memory is very important, so that no one intends to make a terrorist a hero.  I take this opportunity to say that I still do not understand why the European People's Group is the only one proposing time and time again a Resolution on victims of terrorism, which continues to be rejected at the Conference of Presidents by all groups except the ECR.

The Stockholm Programme of 2009 recognised the need to improve legislation and support measures for the protection of victims of crime, including, as a matter of priority, the victims of terrorism, a category which naturally includes the families of direct victims.  Directive 2012/29/EU on victims of crime also recognises that victims of terrorism, suffering the consequences of crimes aimed at harming society as a whole, need special attention and today, more than ever, the victims of terrorism must be able to count on solidarity and national and international support.  Appropriate measures need to be developed in this regard – as the Commissioner whom I thank for his report has pointed out today – but I believe that there is still something more to be envisaged. There is an immediate need for free medical, psychological, social and material assistance.

They don't usually consider themselves heroes for killing. They try to evade the action of justice and not be known.  Terrorism offences are different. When committed in democratic societies like ours, they are very serious crimes that attack men, women, children and the elderly, pursuing, twisting, mutilating or murdering them. But in addition to destroying them and their families, they seek the propaganda effect. Some are wanted to terrorize all, to achieve political goals illegitimately, even to weaken countries. Right now, jihadist terrorism seeks to do us as much damage as possible and weaken our democracy.  Terrorism offences are eminently public crimes. Killers are often considered victims and heroes. They are victims, and their victims are stigmatized and then humiliated when these killers and their environments have the capacity for social control.  The mourning of the victims of terrorism therefore has a dual nature: a private, human nature, which requires attention and help because it devastates the environments, because it leaves a part of the relatives of the people atrociously murdered adrift; and a public, political nature, in the sense that in democratic societies it is the freedoms of all that terrorists attack.  Therefore, justice, truth, memory—which includes the fight against denierism or any other form of indecent rhetoric—are essential. No one will dare support impunity against crimes of rape or murder of children or women. But if those children or women are killed by terrorists, there will be those who at some point ask for impunity for terrorist killers out of collusion or fear.  There are villages in my country where murderers and people involved in terrorist killings are honored and where terrorist killers are proud to have killed. It is intolerable and that must have social and criminal reproach. Because terrorism continues to cause suffering to the victims, to their dignity, to the possibility of performing a duel without consequences each new attack because then the murderers with the right to kill continue to re-claim.

Terrorists can win when a sizable number of the general population sympathise with their long-term objectives. For example, in the United Kingdom, the IRA terrorised and murdered its way into government in Northern Ireland. Few would be publicly prepared to admit to supporting the terrorism of the IRA, but plenty are willing to vote for Sinn Féin, its political wing. The current terrorist threat comes from Islamic fundamentalists who want to establish a world caliphate under Sharia law. We are told that the vast majority of Muslims are peace-loving and non-violent, and I accept that is true. But the majority are not the problem, the minority are; and they all follow the same religion.

I am particularly grateful to Parliament for its report on the prevention of radicalisation and recruitment of European citizens by terrorist organisations, adopted just a few weeks ago. I think that the very close cooperation between all of the actors at different levels – national and local – is very much crucial, and we should encourage greater cooperation between actors on the ground, including in support of victims of terrorism and their families. The Commission recognises the different situations of the victims of terrorism and the victims of general and other crimes, and that is why we proposed the new directive that I was talking about, which includes support for victims of terrorism and their families. The Commission counts very much on support from Parliament for a swift adoption of the proposed directive on combating terrorism.

We ask the Commission not to grant this authorisation. This is done in the context of the debate on democratising the decision-making process around GMOs. This is also the case in the context of the debate on the safety of certain chemicals, in particular gluphosinate and glyphosate, two pesticides which cause resistance in the GMO concerned. The European Parliament has therefore initiated this debate today, at the first time that was possible after the vote in the Committee on the Environment. This was the earliest time to be able to debate it in plenary. And what do we notice? The Commission decided on 4 December, three days after the Committee on the Environment to object and before this plenary debate, to allow this GMO.  Commissioner, you should send the message to your colleague Andriukaitis: this commission's behaviour is indecent. It's a provocation. It is a complete disregard for the political statements of the European Parliament and, in fact, this is also very damaging to the mutual relationship between the Commission and Parliament. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not think we can just let this get over us. We are further away than ever from the promises made by President Juncker on 15 July 2014 and from the political directives put forward, announcing that the Commission would no longer take decisions on GMOs against a majority of Member States. We are further away from that debate than ever before.  The Commission has made an attempt to introduce new legislation on the import of GMOs. We made that proposal on 28 October 2004. and asked the Commission to come up with a new proposal, but the Commission refuses. In the meantime, the Commission is continuing to allow imports of GMO plants into the European Union. In 2015, more than ever before, this type of GMOs were allowed.  Furthermore, of course, this debate is also about the transparency of decision-making in the Commission. I have used the Public Administration Act to find out how the Commission's proposal came about. I got a thick pack of paper, in which all kinds of things are blackened. I call this undemocratic, not transparent. So, Commissioner, I would like to ask you that the 12 options that the Commission had in front of us to achieve greater democratisation of legislation should be passed on to us. I think that would be disrespectful.  Secondly, the public health issue. The GMO concerned that you have now admitted is resistant to pesticide gluphosinate, a highly toxic chemical, and glyphosate. This is in the context of the discussion in which the International Agency for Research on Cancer has said that this substance is probably carcinogenic. EFSA says that is not the case. A letter has been sent from 96 scientists undermining efsa's methods. They say that this has not been done correctly and, in this context, you, the Commission, allow you, Commissioner, a substance that is resistant to these substances and which at least has debate. So, Commissioner, I would like to ask you: answer our questions, withdraw that permit and make sure that we have the options to legislate reasonably and, ladies and gentlemen, let us show that we are not intimidated by the Commission, let us adopt this resolution of the Committee on the Environment on Wednesday.", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 155, "date": "2015-12-14.json", "name": "Bart STAES", "mepid": "4751", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, thank you for giving the Commission the opportunity to react to this draft motion for a resolution on the implementing decision of the Commission authorising the placing on the market of genetically modified maize NK603xT25 for food and feed. First of all, I would like to recall that the European regulatory system for GMOs is among the strictest worldwide. It was adopted and agreed by the European Parliament as the co-legislator. The decision on authorisation that you will discuss today, as with all other decisions on the authorisation of GMOs for food and feed use, is adopted in accordance with the so-called examination procedure set out in Regulation No 182/2011 on comitology. Under this procedure, I acknowledge that the European Parliament has a right of scrutiny concerning the question of whether the draft authorisation exceeds the implementing powers granted to the Commission. From our point of view, this is not the case and I will try to explain why. This regulation provides that decisions on the authorisation of GMOs for food and feed use are adopted by the Commission following several procedural steps. Therefore, allow me to clarify that these steps have been followed for the decision on the authorisation of the aforementioned maize. The application for authorisation to place this GMO on the EU market was submitted in 2010. The European Food Safety Authority performed a comprehensive risk management of this product. This was based on the highest scientific standards, taking into account the positive expert opinions already granted separately for NK602 and T25, both of which are authorised in the EU. In July 2015, EFSA published a favourable opinion which concluded that GM maize NK603xT25 is safe for human and animal health and for the environment. Member States, of course, were able to comment on the risk assessment, and EFSA has addressed all their comments in its final opinion. The public also commented on the EFSA opinion, and all of the scientific comments which were received were scrutinised by EFSA. Based on the positive EFSA opinion, the Commission submitted a draft implementing decision for the authorisation of this GMO to a vote of the standing committee on 19 October 2015. The Member States did not reach a qualified majority against or in favour of this draft decision. In accordance with the comitology rules and the GMO legislation, the Commission proposed the draft decision of authorisation to the appeal committee on 10 November 2015. Again, the Member States did not reach a qualified majority in favour or against.  All these procedural steps followed by the Commission are fully in line with the existing legislation. Therefore, I hope you will appreciate that the Commission did not exceed its implementing powers, as it endeavoured to explain to members of the Environment and Public Health Committee on 1 December 2015. Consequently, the Commission continued to proceed with the draft authorisation decisions for maize NK603xT25 and adopted it on 4 December 2015.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 156, "date": "2015-12-14.json", "name": "Renate SOMMER", "mepid": "4282", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her It is now 16 years since I, as rapporteur for my group, negotiated the so-called Release Directive, which regulates the authorisation and cultivation of GMOs in the European Union, during the conciliation procedure.

The authorisation procedure is fine, these are good rules. The Commission has done the right thing to authorise this maize. BECAUSE EFSA has said that it is okay. That is what this law says, one of the strictest in the world. And then you sit down and say: oh, we as a Parliament must not allow ourselves to be offered this. No, the Commission must decide because the Member States do not decide because they are still shying themselves from a decision for populist reasons. They are afraid of their own people. But what do you want with the rejection of this maize? Do you also explain to the population what happens when we no longer have GMO feed? We need them, we can only produce 5% of the soya we need.

The second issue we have up to treatment is really about glyphosates, and there are actually studies from the USA, from Sweden and from Canada that glyphosate is likely to be carcinogenic. So it is not an easy question. It's not something we can just wave away. The objection that has now been raised is specifically attached to this issue, but I have to say that my colleague Mrs Girling is right on the third question. In this context, there is no possibility, so to speak, of using our legal methods. For this reason, I had to ask the Commission to try to act as if it were grown-up people and that it assumed its responsibilities with regard to glyphosates.

I can only say one thing: we are now discussing two varieties of maize, glufosinate and glyphosate resistant, and at the same time we always have a discussion about the substance glyphosate. And that is not the end of the matter, and it has to be said very clearly here. There are massive concerns on the part of the World Health Organisation, which EFSA admits to ignoring. So we are causing increased use of glyphosate. We must be clear to all of us if we allow this to happen. And, of course, we are shifting the risks back to the global south, because we do not have cultivation here. Whose pressure does this always come about? We have enough maize. It is simply a question of us wanting cheaper raw materials, and that is the pressure on the feed industry, which is once again leading us to talk about new authorisations. Not that we couldn't produce it ourselves, it's just cheaper elsewhere. You just have to see that. We are now importing seven million tonnes of maize, 25% of which is genetically modified.

In fact, the following shortcomings are present in the risk assessment carried out – and I do not want to go into chemical things here, but it was determined on the basis of the data of single modifications – that, when looking at the argonomic and phenotypic characteristics, this genetically modified maize was different from its traditional pair. It was incomprehensible that EFSA did not consider any of the significant differences to be important.  It should also be criticised that, although longer-term animal feeding trials should have been carried out in order to be established that this product does not indeed present a risk, this did not happen. I would like to draw attention to what has already been said here, right, by many people, that maize is resistant to herbicides with phosphate.

Allow me now to react to some of the comments made. Firstly, many of you referred to the commitment that was made by President Juncker. Let me remind you that the commitment was to review the decision-making process for GMOs in order to give more possibilities to Member States to express their views and take into account the concerns of their citizens. The commitment was met with proposals that give legal capacity to the Member States concerning the use of EU-authorised genetically-modified food and feed on their territory based on national reasons unrelated to risks to health and the environment.  Your draft resolution makes reference to the decision of the European Parliament on 28 October 2015 to reject these legislative proposals. The Commission regrets the decision of the European Parliament, because the Commission believes that this legislative proposal would enable Member States to address, at national level, considerations which are not covered by the EU decision-making process. The Commission, therefore, maintained this proposal, which should be discussed in the Council at the beginning of 2016 as the next step in the ordinary legislative procedure.  As a second point, I want to say that the Commission is aware of your concerns as regards the herbicide glyphosate. I would like to recall that the approval of active substances for plant protection products, such as glyphosate, and the setting of maximum residue levels for herbicides in food and feed products are not regulated by GMO legislation, but by the Regulation on Pesticides and Maximum Residue Levels. The review procedure for glyphosate is ongoing. Please be reassured that your concerns are duly noted in this regard. As regards the request in the resolution to suspend GMO authorisation until the authorisation process is reviewed, allow me to stress that the Commission has indeed reviewed the authorisation process. It has consequently proposed to amend the GMO legislation. The proposal is in codecision procedure, and, as usual, the rules in place continue to apply during the negotiations between the co-legislators and until a final agreement is reached. The Commission can therefore only proceed with the GM food and feed application in compliance with the existing legal framework.  In conclusion, let me call on you not to adopt this motion for a resolution.

Madam President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the commissioner for her excellent work and for the work she has done. I would like to thank the shadow rapporteurs and also the Commission for the really good cooperation on this report in recent months. We have had constructive cooperation, several shadow rapporteur meetings, and we have been able to negotiate viable compromises, which also found a broad majority in committee. I expect the same for the report here in plenary. What is this report really about? It was a matter of reviewing the implementation of the Progress microfinancial instrument halfway through its term on how effectively and sustainably new livelihoods can be created by giving unemployed and disadvantaged people access to loans that they would not otherwise have because of their social situation.  However, it was also a question of investigating whether there were any omissions in this instrument. What is the Progress financial instrument? It was launched in 2010 with a volume of 205 million euros, initially financed by the Progress programme of the same name. Since 2013, there has been a new financial basis called EaSI, which is the instrument for work and social innovation.  Progress' financial support allows lenders to lend more to people at higher risk of default through broader refinancing. We have seen a low default risk of up to 5%. The Progress microfinancial instrument is now available in 22 out of 28 Member States, and soon there will be 23 with Croatia.   What have we been able to find? Progress is a functioning social policy instrument and makes a difference – especially in the times of the financial crisis. This is confirmed by the European Court of Auditors' investigation this year.  It helps to achieve the employment objectives of the Europe 2020 strategy, because most jobs are ultimately created in micro-enterprises, and that is where the instrument starts. It supports the building of existence and the preservation of existence. This is underpinned by the high number of micro-credits. Progress is beneficial for the European taxpayer and is socially valuable. Unemployed people get a chance and can set up a business that pays taxes and creates employment. This is cheaper than paying out transfers.  The lending requirements were almost met. 13 252 micro-credits with a volume of EUR 124.6 million were granted, slightly less than the target of EUR 142.4 million.  As far as the target groups are concerned, we have seen the following: some colleagues wanted to broaden the number of beneficiaries, which others found problematic, given the small financial resources of only EUR 205 million. In my view, a viable middle ground has been found here.  The female quota is pleasingly high: 37% of the beneficiaries are women entrepreneurs. As a result, Progress does not quite meet the 40% target. In future, we would like to see a balanced rate of 50% men and 50% women.  Less well-favoured groups and minorities were reached. We also found that indicators developed for data collection were often inappropriate and insufficiently detailed, and that we do not know enough about the needs and survival rates of micro-enterprises. We have also found that social economy companies have been less well served with credit. The problem has already been detected. Under EaSI, the financial allocation of social enterprises has been significantly improved. However, for these companies, the specific programme of credit intermediaries is now lacking. I am now looking forward to the debate and will comment again afterwards.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 179, "date": "2015-12-14.json", "name": "Sven SCHULZE", "mepid": "124809", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Sven Schulze, for his report, which stresses the importance of adequate access to, and the availability of, finance with a direct impact on Europe’s 2020 targets, fostering employment and fighting poverty and social exclusion. Our ambition, as highlighted several times by President Juncker, is to create quality jobs and get Europe growing again. Microfinance is an important tool to promote entrepreneurship and help Europe get back on the path to growth and, ultimately, to reduce social and financial exclusion. I therefore welcome this report, which sheds light on the European Progress Microfinance Facility’s achievements in making entrepreneurship an option for all, including vulnerable persons and those who would be otherwise financially excluded.  To promote the potential of microfinance for enabling entrepreneurship, on 19 October this year my colleague, Commissioner Thyssen, opened the first European Microfinance Day in Brussels, together with the Luxembourg Presidency and representatives of the European Investment Bank, the European Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee. Your report rightly highlights that the Facility has substantially contributed to job preservation and, if I may add, to job creation with over 60 000 jobs created or maintained thanks to this Facility. In addition, half of micro-borrowers reported an increase in their turnover thanks to the microloans made possible by this Facility. The relevance of the Facility to enabling unemployed and disadvantaged people to gain access to finance, especially in times of crisis, is well underlined in your report. Indeed, Progress microfinance has a track record of successful outreach to such vulnerable groups. A recently published report by the European Court of Auditors assisting the Facility’s intervention in microfinance concluded that thanks to the use of financial instruments it has adequately addressed the needs of micro-entrepreneurs. Moreover, the financial instruments under the successor EU programme for Employment and Social Innovation (EaSI) could also play an important role in addressing some of the challenges posed by the intensifying refugee influx. Your report precisely points to the fact that while Progress microfinance can be considered successful as a whole, there is room for improvement. Indeed, these improvements, such as greater outreach to target vulnerable groups and improved social impact reporting, combined with technical assistance and dedicated support for capacity-building of microcredit providers and increased complementarity with other instruments, have been taken into account in the design of the successor Employment and Social Innovation programme, as well as specific support for social enterprises, which is a priority objective of the Commission.  The EaSI Programme is making EUR 193 million available until 2020. This includes EUR 96 million in guarantees which can leverage more than EUR 500 million to micro and social entrepreneurs. Moreover, I would like to stress that the EaSI Regulation already includes a definition of ‘social enterprise’. Therefore, it would be advisable to stick to this definition. In addition to guarantees and funded instruments, EaSI financial instruments will offer funding for capacity building. This will help microcredit providers develop their business and better channel much—needed funds to the most excluded clients, which are often hard to reach. I am very pleased to announce that the recently launched guarantee scheme, with about EUR 90 million for microfinance and social entrepreneurship, has made a very promising start. In four months, the European Investment Fund, which manages the scheme, has received over 30 applications, accounting for approximately half of the total budget. In conclusion, I welcome the report’s recommendation that the Progress Microfinance Facility should be continued.

This has also been a technical and political challenge for this Parliament.  We have been working since the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, which has also wanted to give its opinion because we believe – and this is the key issue for us – that credit has not only an economic object in society, but also a social role, and especially a programme like this that tries to reach people outside the natural financial market. That's why we've driven a number of opinions.  Firstly, the need to continue the microcredit market by strengthening the figure of intermediaries , and especially non-bank intermediaries , in order to maximiate the possibilities of financing all kinds of projects, especially vulnerable people, discussed here today , unemployed people, people with disabilities and some new phenomena, to which the Commissioner referred, such as that of the refugees we have had this year.  Solve the implementation problems detected in the Progress instrument through the new program that replaces it; encourage the creation of opportunities for self-employment and quality job creation among the unemployed, especially since we know that unemployment is a major problem on the continent; urge the Commission to rigorously assess the attainment of these social objects; expand access to microcredits, especially businesses in the social economy; and encourage respect and compliance with the code of good practice for this type of activity.

Madam President, the European Progress Microfinance Mechanism aims to facilitate the establishment and support of small businesses in order to boost employment in the Member States of the Union. Since 2010, it has focused on supporting the long-term unemployed and, in general, the economically weaker, by granting microcredit of less than EUR 25 000, for the establishment and expansion of small enterprises. However, the Progress Mechanism set up to combat poverty, by strengthening entrepreneurship, has finally simply evolved into a profitable banking industry.  Moreover, this microfinance, combined with the European Union's 2016 funds for financial support, is not sufficient to boost employment, especially in impoverished Greece with its one and a half million unemployed and the thousands of small businesses that have closed.

I had the chance to speak to several beneficiaries from my own country, Romania, as well as from Belgium, Bulgaria and the Netherlands. I saw how with a little money at the right time, and with dedication, people’s lives can change for themselves and also for their employees. Such instruments are the right answer to the question: what kind of help do people need? Most of them do not need and do not want state assistance, but rather want to be empowered to manage their own lives. The European Parliament has been calling for such an instrument since 2008, by means of its own-initiative resolution. When the microfinance facility was eventually established in 2010, it was conceived in response to the worsening credit market in the European Union and in order to reach the goals of the EU 2020 strategy on growth and jobs. However, even if overall the microfinance facility can take credit for making finance more accessible and for contributing to job preservation and job creation, there was relatively little focus on vulnerable groups. This is one field in which I hope that we will do better in the future. I cannot but hope that the instrument which will replace it from 2016, EaSI, will take into consideration our recommendations. And maybe other similar instruments should be set up to empower more categories of people: those who – as revealed by the evaluation – belong to an unprofitable target group like the young, unemployed or self-employed, immigrant minorities and disabled.

It is not built to directly finance micro-enterprise, but allows providers or intermediaries to increase their lending. It has helped those they support to realise their potential as entrepreneurs, to develop new skills through training and monitoring and to find jobs. It is aimed at target groups: the unemployed, those claiming social benefits, immigrants – people who cannot get conventional bank loans. It is primarily a socio-political instrument, providing loans of up to EUR 25 000. As we know, the best social policy that one can give is the opportunity to help people to help themselves – to give them a leg-up, rather than a hand-out. Entrepreneurship gives people meaning, allowing them a stake in their own community, and that filters through in the value that it provides in terms of job creation, confidence and certainly vibrancy in that community. There have been a number of comments raised in the report. While the implementation of the Facility has been successful, nonetheless there are areas where it can be improved. In the area of women’s entrepreneurship, we need to ensure we look at best practice and encourage sharing of experiences and, of course, youth entrepreneurship.

This agreement is strategic and non-operational, thus excluding implications for personal data and, as Europol has repeatedly pointed out, the United Arab Emirates is turning into a basin for economic and financial crime. It is well known that they are considered to be a country of destination for the proceeds of illegal activities, such as VAT fraud against European states, and money laundering. It is clear that more structured cooperation would strengthen Europol's coordinating role with a view to resolving in practice investigations, the outcome of which involves two or more European states.  Cross-border criminal networks can only be effectively combated through synergistic cooperation at international level.

Technical measures and multiannual plans are the main instruments for achieving the objectives of the common fisheries policy, and let us not be fooled by the concept of 'technical' as if it were a secondary concept. In fact, this issue is of first-class political importance. Technical measures determine the lives of hundreds of thousands of fishermen and, therefore, it is important that we succeed in their formulation.  We believe that it is necessary to amend the existing legislation, consisting of a large number of legislative acts, in order to adapt it to the new common fisheries policy by incorporating aspects such as the prohibition of discards and regionalisation. This review should allow for simplification and reformulation of rules that have become obsolete after the reform of the CFP, as well as those that are not working or should be improved, and, of course, should serve to improve the understanding of the battery of intricate legislative texts that are in force in order to facilitate their compliance by the sectors concerned.  We have a challenge. The new regulation needs to be able to respond quickly to changes in resources and ecosystems and take into account in real time the technical development of more selective fishing gear. European legislation should support this development, not be a brake on it, as well as rely on scientifically proven foundations.  Greater dynamism must be ensured in resource management and the participation of the fisheries sector in decision-making should be ensured, as well as more rational management of fisheries through regionalization. We need, as the sector asks us, a flexible framework, capable of responding to the different circumstances and new situations that we face at all times. And I would like to draw attention to the importance of always meeting proportionality criteria to avoid insalvable socio-economic consequences. In this report we are discussing today, I propose an architecture for the new four-axis articulated regulation: three of them would cover, on the one hand, a set of common and centralised rules, specific rules for the most important sea basins and a number of specific regulations adopted by codecision; and a fourth axis, subject to regionalization, should be applied to regional standards subject to frequent changes. With regard to multiannual plans, they represent the most suitable vehicle for the adoption and implementation of specific technical measures for the different fishing areas. We must therefore ensure that they meet their objective. It is necessary for co-legislators to continue the effort to reach agreements on multiannual plans with regard to the institutional competences provided for in the Treaty and on the basis of the most recent relevant case-law. And, of course, stakeholder participation in the design and development of these plans and in all regionalization decisions must be increased.  I hope that my initiative report will kick-start for a constructive debate in which we should do everything possible to listen to the various fisheries sectors concerned and achieve a harmony between their interests and the preservation of marine resources.

The report is very timely, because the Commission is at this moment preparing a legislative proposal for modernised technical conservation measures for the whole EU. I am happy to say the report is well in line with our own analysis, recognising regionalisation and simplification as the way forward. The new proposal is a priority for the Commission, and I can confirm that we intend to table the proposal early in 2016.  It will basically consist of a framework body of basic rules, covering all EU waters. We intend to concentrate on changing the governance model. This will allow for regionalisation, and changes to the substance will be limited to simplification by removing redundant measures and regionalising others. This is an ideal opportunity to apply a more flexible approach to achieving our objective of sustainable fisheries management.  It is also important to underline that the new proposal will not change the conservation standards that we have now: it rather enables improved conservation. On multiannual plans, again, the Commission very much agrees with the analysis in your report. These plans are a crucial element of the reformed common fisheries policy because, firstly, they are the main instrument for achieving the objective of maximum sustainable yields in an orderly fashion. Secondly, they contribute to certainty and stability for the industry. Thirdly, they are an important tool for implementing the landing obligation and regionalisation.

We have largely overcome the interinstitutional and political differences, and the Commission is hopeful that we can achieve a compromise soon. We will continue to facilitate such an agreement.

Therefore, the common fisheries policy should pay much more attention to sustainable fish farming, i.e. aquaculture, and in particular freshwater fish farming. In Hungary we find highly developed closed-system fish farms that are productive, sustainable and contribute significantly to the survival of biodiversity.

The current price zone, which has been in place since 2002, ensures that almost 100% security of electricity supply is guaranteed at competitive prices. Similarly, cross-border electricity trade is a best priority for the internal electricity market, and the targets set in the Europe 2020 and 2030 strategy for the ambitious expansion of renewable energy are more feasible through the electricity price zone.

What I find very important is the success of the right in the regions where unemployment is highest, which corresponds to the assessment of the economic policy of the Socialists.

I would like to say that for several times we have also heard from pro-European politicians from Germany, Austria, the Netherlands linking this subject to the fact that if some states do not want to participate in the problems of migration, and I do not rate it, they will be cut in cohesion contributions, cohesion policy. I consider this linking cohesion policy to the migration problem or the migration crisis to be a major problem in Europe. I do not think that we should be conditionally drawn on cohesion policy, cohesion funds, but of course we also have to show solidarity and I understand that, for example, cohesion policy could also be used precisely for the integration of migrants.
