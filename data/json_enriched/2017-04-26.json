It is an initiative that aims to encourage young women to pursue careers in the ever-expanding fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. In Europe, only 29 women out of every 1 000 graduates have a scientific degree, compared to 95 out of 1 000 men with a degree, and unfortunately only 4 of these actually have a job in this sector. Globally, women occupy only 24% of science and technology jobs and tend to be concentrated in administrative roles. The gender gap then tends to increase as you move up the hierarchy. The gender gap in technology is also about simply accessing an internet connection and a mobile phone. The female population with internet access is 12% less than the male population, and this percentage has unfortunately increased in recent years. I hope that tomorrow will serve as a starting point and inspiration to work together to ensure a better future for young people around the world. We must make ours one of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, the fifth, which aims to achieve gender equality also through information and communication technologies. This is why it is necessary to work to make our education systems inclusive and efficient, as well as to encourage young people and companies to remove gender barriers and to value the contribution of working women.

We share those worries and concerns. Questions have been asked about the compatibility of certain actions of the Hungarian authorities with EU law and with our shared values, and also these questions were raised by this Parliament with the Commission. That is why the College decided to discuss the overall situation in Hungary in two recent meetings on 12 April and today. The discussions allowed us to assess all the issues in an objective, fact-based and law-based manner. We also consider that given the wider situation, including the spirit of Article 2 TEU, a broader political dialogue between the Hungarian authorities, other Member States, the European Parliament and the Commission should take place. That is why I welcome the debate in plenary today which is part of that broader political dialogue with the participation of the Hungarian authorities at the highest level. The recently adopted Hungarian Higher Education law is perceived by many as an attempt to close down the Central European University, which I think is a pearl in the crown of post-divided Europe, a Europe free and whole.  (Applause) The Commission’s analysis of the law confirmed our concerns with regard to its compatibility with internal market freedoms and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The college has therefore decided today to launch infringement proceedings against Hungary by sending a letter of formal notice and we await a reaction from the Hungarian authorities within a month.  The draft legislation tabled to the Hungarian Parliament at the beginning of April on the funding of so-called foreign non-governmental organisations is also on our radar screen. If adopted, it could raise concerns as regards the compatibility with the EU’s internal market rules, in particular the free movement of capital and the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, including the freedom of assembly. Civil society is the very fabric of democratic societies. We would not be democracies without strong and free civil societies. (Applause) I would therefore deeply regret any action by the Hungarian authorities aimed at shrinking the space of civil society organisations, or any attempt to control or stigmatise their work. Yes, NGOs need to be transparent about their finances, but the Commission will continue to follow the draft legislation closely and will express its concerns on the draft law in the context of this broader political dialogue.  We also discussed asylum and respect for values of human dignity, freedom and human rights, tolerance and solidarity. The Commission has already expressed its concerns about the existing Hungarian law. The new asylum law adopted at the end of March raises serious doubts about compatibility with EU law. Commissioner Avramopoulos has launched discussions on these issues with the Hungarian authorities. If these discussions do not produce timely results, the Commission will not hesitate to take further action. The protection of pregnant working women is another area we have raised formally with the Hungarian authorities and as our concerns remain unanswered the college will shortly decide on the need for further action to ensure full compliance with EU rules on maternity leave and gender equality in employment. Let me here make a more general point. Where the Hungarian authorities engage in a dialogue with the Commission, good progress can be made, and I want to be crystal clear about this. Whenever we ask for a dialogue with the Hungarian authorities, they always oblige and start a dialogue so I want there to be no misunderstanding about this. I want to mention two examples where we have reached good progress. With regard to the transposition of the Framework Decision on Racism and Xenophobia, we are pleased to see that in our discussions with the Hungarian authorities our concerns have been addressed in recently adopted amendments to the Hungarian criminal code. However, of course practical implementation of national legislation is key and hate crime cases need to be investigated in practice. We will continue to monitor the situation on the ground. As regards the values of equality and non-discrimination, the college continues to be attentive to the situation of the Roma in Hungary and in particular to discrimination against Roma children in education. Here we also had a lot of discussion and dialogue, and following our technical discussions with the Hungarian authorities the Commission is awaiting for Hungary to notify the recently proposed legislative amendments in this field. You will all be aware of the Hungarian Government’s ‘Stop Brussels’ consultation. I am pleased to announce that the Commission has decided to make public its own response in order to dispel misunderstandings and perhaps get the facts straight. The European Union is not, and has never been, about Brussels: the European Union is a project driven and designed by its Member States, each of which has decided individually and democratically that this is the path they wish to adopt. This includes Hungary. Each and every one of those Member States, including Hungary, take both the responsibility and the credit for decisions we take collectively. Each and every one of those Member States, including Hungary, under- signed the rules of the club.  Several of the claims and allegations made in the consultation need correction. For instance, and I quote: ‘Brussels wants to force Hungary to abolish the reduction in public utility charges’. The reality, however, is that the Commission shares the Hungarian Government’s objective to have affordable energy for households. The best way to achieve this is to establish competitive energy markets and promote energy efficiency and innovation, and to work together at European level to ensure security of supply. That is at the core of the Energy Union proposals. Another allegation: Brussels wants to force Hungary to let in illegal immigrants. Again, the reality is that the European Union is fighting irregular migration and is actively helping Member States to manage their external borders and return irregular migrants who have no right to stay in the EU, but irregular migration needs to be distinguished from seeking asylum. We have a shared responsibility to live up to our international obligations to protect people fleeing war and persecution and treat them fairly and with dignity.  (Applause)  Now let me be very clear. Hungary in 2015 was under incredible pressure, incredible pressure, which was extremely difficult to manage. Given those exceptional pressures in 2015, in September of that year the Commission proposed to relocate up to 54 000 asylum applicants from Hungary to other Member States, but this proposal was opposed by the Hungarian Government. Hungary is therefore asked to accept a very limited number of asylum seekers – 1 294. These are not illegal immigrants ... from the two most overburdened Member States, Greece and Italy. Asylum seekers can select (for) themselves, it is not shoved down their throats, they can select for themselves.  Another allegation: illegal immigrants heading to Hungary are encouraged to illegal acts not by just human traffickers, but also by some international organisations. Let me be very clear about this: the European Union has zero tolerance for human trafficking and it has taken action for many years to combat this heinous crime. Saving lives at sea and looking after vulnerable people who are in need of international protection is not the same thing as promoting irregular migration. There is no evidence whatsoever of NGOs working with criminal-smuggling networks to help migrants enter the EU.  A fourth claim: more and more organisation supported from abroad operate in Hungary with the aim of interfering in Hungarian internal matters in a non-transparent manner. I have already indicated earlier the Commission’s position. While the conditions under which non-governmental organisations carry out their activities are in principle a matter of national law, those conditions must be in line with EU law and the Union’s values. That is the importance of civil society. The European Union for its part has strict rules on transparency and lobbying of the European institutions.  The fifth allegation is that Brussels is attacking Hungary’s job-creating measures. The opposite is true. The EU is massively supporting job creation in Hungary. The Hungarian authorities themselves have reported that this contributed to creating more than 150 000 jobs. The last issue on the questionnaire is that Brussels is attacking our country because of tax cuts. The fact of the matter is that EU taxation rules must be agreed by all Member States unanimously. The EU has agreed only minimum VAT levels. It is the Hungarian Government that has decided to set the rate at 27% which is the highest in the EU. Honourable Members, on 23 March the leaders of 27 Member States and the EU institutions, including the Prime Minister of Hungary, stated in the Rome Declaration, and I quote: ‘Sixty years ago, recovering from the tragedy of two world wars, we decided to bond together and rebuild our continent from its ashes. We have built a unique Union with common institutions, strong values, a community of peace, freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law’. And I have to add to this on a personal note. As a young man I travelled regularly to Hungary and I remember very well the sense of oppression I felt crossing the border from Austria into Hungary: the barbed wire, the watchtowers, the oppressive feeling in Budapest that you had all the time. The biggest single miracle in my lifetime is the fall of the Berlin Wall, the fall of the Iron Curtain and that Hungary became one of the democratic nations of Europe, and that is not something the European Union should claim credit for. This is something that was done by the Hungarian people themselves: striving for freedom, protecting their freedom, however, it is now a common European task and we will have to fight for that. Given this history, given the Rome Declaration, how can one reconcile this with a campaign to stop Brussels? The fact that only one month after this Declaration we are having today’s debate on the situation in Hungary gives us all the more reason to seek clarifications about the intentions of the Hungarian Government. Let me say in conclusion that I strongly thank Parliament for supporting this, but I also want to express my gratitude to Prime Minister Orbán for coming here today and having this debate with us. Dialogue is the European way, dialogue to solve misunderstandings, but also dialogue when we disagree. That is the European way.

Mr Vice-President of the Commission, Ladies and Gentlemen! The European Parliament is once again debating Hungary. I came here to Brussels to take part in this debate. Slowly in my thirty-year-old representation, I always appreciated the debate and the clash of differing views. Democracy is argument-based, and it gives the European Union a moral basis. I am convinced that better decisions are always made if they come from debate and not from unilateral revelations. By participating here, I would also like to help you make an informed decision when Hungary is on their agenda. I remember the previous Parliament's resolutions on Hungary did not stand the test of truth. Just think of the spectacular and embarrassing failure of the Tavares report. You may know that we Hungarians will never give up the fight, and today I am trying to use the power of common sense in this debate as well. Our dispute is partly with you and partly with an American financial speculator. I know that Hungary's strength, size and weight are much smaller than yours, and smaller than that of the American financial speculator George Soros, who attacked Hungary and destroyed the lives of millions of Europeans with financial speculation, who was punished for speculation in Hungary he is also an openly confessed enemy, yet he is so highly esteemed here that he is received by the top leaders of the European Union. But this is no reason to condemn us on the basis of untruths, because fairness is not a function of country size. Dear House! I came to defend my country in the debate. But it’s also important to be able to report on successes. In 2008, we left where Greece was. The then Hungarian government was the first to turn to the IMF and to you, the European Union, for a loan. Since then, this money has been repaid ahead of time and in full. Since then, many hundreds of thousands we have created jobs. Hungary is on its way to the lowest unemployment rate in the Union. Today it is 4 percent. We have created a work-based society, instead of giving aid to everyone who wants to work. Full employment is our goal. Our budget deficit has been exceeding what you demand for years, most recently it was minus 1.8 percent, our public debt is declining, and our economic growth is stable at around 4 percent this year. We still have a number of issues to solve, but we have something to be proud of. I am convinced that Hungary's success is also a European success, and the Union needs success today. It would be foolish if, due to ideological differences, this fact did not receive enough attention. Dear European Parliament! I see there are several issues that may be of interest to you. It is rumored that the Hungarian government closed the law of György Soros, an American financial speculator in Budapest, by law. The rector of this university wrote to the faculty and students of the institution, I quote: \"We would like to emphasize that the existence of the Central European University is not endangered by anything, the university will continue to operate in all circumstances.\" Commission, Parliament, this accusation is therefore unfounded and has no factual basis. The situation is absurd. It’s like when someone is charged with murder and even convicted while the victim of the alleged crime lives and thrives. In fact, he himself points to the convict, shouting at the killer. The reality is that the minor amendments to the law passed by the Hungarian Parliament affect 28, 28 foreign universities operating in Hungary and do nothing more than unify the regulations applicable to them, close the possibility of speculation and abuse, demand transparency and eliminate them vis-à-vis European universities. has enjoyed a privileged position so far. You are European legislators. It is my duty as the Prime Minister of Hungary, the leader of an EU member state to ensure that European and Hungarian universities are not at a disadvantage vis-à-vis their competitors outside the Union. They are the owners of any great and rich man. Dear Parliament! The other item on the agenda is the national consultation announced by my government these days. I would like to inform you that during the last decade it has become customary in Hungary to ask the citizens of the country regularly. We have held national consultations four times in recent years. I wholeheartedly recommend this method to you as well. During the current consultation, the Hungarian government is asking for the support of the Hungarian people in order to form the position to be represented in Brussels on specific issues. Dear Ladies and Gentlemen! I would like to make it clear that the commitment of Hungary and the Hungarian Government to the European Union is unquestionable. Hungarian politics has been built on this foundation for the past thirty years. That is why I signed it, and that is why I fully agree with the recently adopted Rome Declaration and with the program of my party family, the European People's Party, adopted in Malta. At the same time, Mr President, Mr Vice-President, we are dissatisfied with the functioning of the European Union in many respects. We are criticizing because we want to make mistakes and we want to reform the European Union. We are convinced that we can only regain the trust of citizens in the European institutions if we do everything we can to eliminate the causes of poor and inefficient operation. Therapy requires a clear diagnosis, a clear name of the troubles. I personally do, but we Hungarians usually like straight speech. We articulate it clearly and unambiguously so that everyone understands it, even if we know that not everyone likes it. We are irritated by the stubborn political language that makes us unfit to describe things, which has taken a bite in European public life today. But I don't think it's European The same temperament and style of debate would be expected in the 28 countries of the Union. That is why I find it exciting, and that is why I personally like European political culture. If you break down, if you break down the prejudices that are nurtured against us, you will find refreshing, innovative and creative political thinking. This is also true for consultation. I am convinced that this is exactly what Hungary owes its results to. In some of the cases raised in the national consultation questionnaire, the basic position of the Hungarian government, this straightforward speech, is contrary to the Commission's intentions. It is clear that we do not want, and do not consider it compatible with the founding treaties of the EU, for migrants to be resettled in our country. Who we live with can only be decided by Hungarian citizens. Important information is that György Soros and his NGOs want to transport one million migrants to the European Union every year. He personally announced this program publicly and also offered him a financial loan. You could read too. We reject this proposal. Nor do we want to lose the right of the utilities to set the price of public utilities so far, because we fear that this will increase the burden on the population and lead to a sharp rise in prices again, and Hungarian families have already suffered enough from this. Nor do we want the right to impose taxes, which is currently a national competence, to be transferred to the Union, because we believe that this would damage our competitiveness. Nor do we understand that the Commission criticizes the Hungarian public works system every year in its annual report, which is an important element of a developed work-based and non-aid-based society. These are current issues of debate. Our position is that we do not want a change in these, we do not want a reorganization of national and EU competences in these matters, that is, we are defending the status quo that is currently being developed with a common will. Hence the \"Stop Brussels!\" name as well. Isn't that a sin? We received together we also have the rules that are now in force, which we are defending, the current rules that we want to protect are also common European Union acquis. Therefore, in my opinion, the Hungarian position cannot be, and the Hungarian consultation cannot be described as anti-European. It is also true - and I do not want to deny it - that our vision of Europe is based on a strong Europe of strong member states. In such a Europe, the Member States bear the responsibility and do not shirk their responsibilities. Responsibility for public debt, budget and border protection. Dear Members! We want to shape decision-making here by means of debate, reasoning and persuasion. I suggest that those who do not like the opinion of our country should confront their own arguments, fight our debates, but please do not condemn because Hungary has its own independent opinion. Dear House! The third issue is the regulation of non-governmental organizations. The draft now being discussed, that is, being discussed at home in Hungary, takes over the American model. In several countries of the Union, and as far as I know, in the framework of the Pieper report here in Parliament, you are also addressing the difficult question of how to make the operation of a capital-intensive foreign external lobby that wants to influence democratic decision-making transparent to everyone. Hungarian law is based on the principles of transparency. All we want is to know about NGOs, what money and what interests are behind them. This does not undermine their constitutional right to have their voices heard, to represent their interests and to organize freely. Dear Members! It is also important to note that the behavior of the Hungarian government so far has been a detourless, always consistent behavior, we want to follow the rules of the club, and we have always followed it so far. I am aware that EU membership entails not only rights but also obligations. We have tried to resolve the conflicts of recent years through dialogue and negotiation. I'm happy to report that As a result, we managed to close such issues as possible, such as media regulation, the new Hungarian constitution, the reform of the court system or the development of nuclear energy. These are successfully closed cases. I would like to assure the Vice-President that we will strive for this in the matters that are now on the agenda. Dear House! Hungary is a proud country. Hungarians have always considered themselves an important nation of Europe, committed to the European Christian values, and wanted to be involved in the decisions that affect them. My government in Hungary is working to strengthen Hungary's commitment to the European Union. Our work is successful. The support of the European Union is the highest among the member states in Hungary, over 70 percent, and we are proud of that. Believe me, people support the European Union, but it will only support it if it is based on fair and open debate and is able to admit that it needs reform at times. Mr President, we have always given you the respect. Please, when it comes to Hungary, be critical of prejudice, I ask you to stick to the truth, and I ask you to measure it on an equal footing. Only in this way can we all be worthy of a European name.

It's not about Soros today. I don't understand one thing. For 25 years, the Central European University in Budapest has been issuing two diplomas: one American and one Hungarian. This has been good practice for 25 years and it has earned a reputation. Hungarian students benefit from this because they get two degrees in their city - in Budapest. I, and I can say this for my entire group, dear Prime Minister, we simply do not understand why this advantage is now being taken away from this university. (Applause) Our request is clear and simple: the freedom of science is a fundamental value of the European Union, which must be upheld and defended. The university administrators just want to do their job, namely to teach students. That is why I ask Viktor Orbán to accept and implement the specifications, requests and requests for changes that the Commission has now launched. I would like to single out a second point. I don't understand a second thing, which is: yes, you can disagree, you can take different positions in a debate, of course. But what is being practiced in Hungary with this survey is not the gathering of arguments and opinions, but it is propaganda against Europe. (Applause) When we talk about bureaucrats who rule Brussels, I now look into this room and see, dear Viktor Orbán - Prime Minister, don't be angry with me: most of the bureaucrats are behind you, the rest of them are here in this house are all MPs, elected politicians who work here. That is why I would like to make it clear that it is not bureaucrats who decide in Brussels, but elected politicians - ministers, MPs. Elected politicians decide in Brussels. We may not allow us to permanently damage it. I say there are many national politicians who are raising the mood against Europe. But we cannot tolerate that happening. A strong Hungary needs a strong EU in the long run, and we must not damage that. However, I understand one thing a little better, and I would like to make that clear: when the Hungarian government puts an initiative on the table to want to know who finances the NGO and how it is financed, then I wonder why the Green Group is that is attacking now. Here in Brussels, the Green Group is the one that is most in favor of transparency. They want to know how NGOs are financed. I will tell you in all honesty: The fact that we in Hungary will have transparency about what money comes from Russia or America or God knows where to finance this NGO - I would also like a law like this for Europe. I would also like to know who is funding all of this. (Applause) When it comes to the quality of Viktor Orbán's work in Hungary, the balance sheet that he presented today, the work that he is doing for his country and therefore for Europe, then Hungary must not be made Europe's nightmare . Hungary has done an excellent job in many areas, and I would like to say specifically that some conservative politics also belong to my party family, to the European People's Party, and we don't let anyone give us advice on who belongs to the EPP and who doesn't. Last but not least, I would like to thank Frans Timmermans. He pointed out that this is the way we should work in Europe. If there is a problem we sit down and talk to each other. Unfortunately, I have to correct Frans Timmermans on one point: not every party practices this path - it is the EPP path. Viktor Orbán has never avoided the debates and he has always delivered. The deviations were always eliminated, which the Commission asked him to do.However, when we were discussing Romania and the corruption laws there, no Romanian socialist prime minister was present.I hope that Mr Muscat, who is now up to his ankle in the Panama swamp in Malta, will be here next month - in May - to answer the questions.After all, he is the President of the Council.(Applause) Therefore: The socialists speak here with two tongues.The EPP is here and we are talking to each other.Europe is not the right of the strong, but the strength of the law.Viktor Orbán has proven and confirmed this in recent years.That is why we trust that in this case too he will be ready to listen to the European proposals and implement them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 21, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Antonio TAJANI", "mepid": "2187", "text": "Given the number of subscribers to speak and also given the delicacy of the discussion, also because I would like to grant the \"catch-the-eye\", I will not grant \"carton bleu\" questions during the discussion.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 22, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Gianni PITTELLA", "mepid": "4436", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D Group. - (IT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all I would like to thank Frans Timmermans for his clear and firm words and for the intentions he expressed on the part and on behalf of the European Commission.

President Orban, you lie knowing that you are lying, because you are well aware that the European Parliament does not defend the interests of a great American financier, but defends the legitimate expectation of young Hungarian students who do not want to be deprived of a great, beautiful and excellent university. We are not only defending the Central European University, but all universities, we are defending science, research, school, culture, everything that is the basis of democracy. And it's not just the question of the university. We have no prejudices towards her and towards other personalities who do not have the same political color. We are used to dialogue and we are used to having respect for our adversaries, whom we never consider enemies. But we don't have ham on our eyes. We cannot fail to see what is happening in Hungary on the issue of media pluralism. We cannot fail to see what is happening in terms of the accessibility of non-governmental organizations. We cannot fail to see, dear President Orban, that you have refused to implement a refugee relocation plan, not the one million requested by Soros, we don't care what Soros is asking! We are interested in what the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament have asked for: 1 100, 1 000 and just over refugees! On what grounds did you deny the possibility for people fleeing war, terrorism and violence to enter Hungary? As if Hungary were a state excluded from the European Union. It is right to stay and we are very happy because we love the Hungarian people. It is right that when you are in a family you share the advantages and the burdens and burdens of being together. Then there is a political issue, and I turn to my colleague Weber who has reconfirmed the link between President Orban and the popular group. I have listened to positive voices from popular colleagues attentive to the issue of democracy, attentive to the issue of freedom. But I ask myself and ask my colleague Weber if it is still possible to contemplate Orban's stay in the family that belonged to De Gasperi, that belonged to Kohl, that was of personalities who built European democracy, who have always defended freedom, democracy and pluralism. I think that the presence of President Orban from the Christian-democratic family must now be dissociated immediately. Finally, President Orban, stop playing the game of going to Budapest and saying that it is all our fault, that we are the bad and the ugly ones who impose certain choices, that we are the bad and the ugly ones who impose. It is not we who want to close the universities, it is not we who want to make NGOs fail, it is not we who want to close the media, it is not we who want to reject refugees!

Mr President Timmermans! The Lord mentioned his personal experiences, about the trip to Hungary. I would just like to remind everyone that Hungary - just like my country, Poland - was the pioneers of freedom of countries in the Eastern Bloc at the time when Western European countries wanted to deal with the Soviet Union, and at universities - because today we are also talking about a university - Italian or German, Marxism in all its forms reigned. So we Poles, we Hungarians, we Czechs, we Slovaks do not really need lessons about freedom, democracy, but we are willing to share our experiences, our conclusions that come from observing reality also in your countries. You said something about civil society. Yes, civil society is the basis on which the existence of democracy and its functioning are based, but it is civil society that must, of course, have an appropriate structure, as everywhere. It cannot be postcolonial or colonial, as it is unfortunately still common in Central and Eastern Europe. And it seems to me that you would like to consolidate this structure. When it comes to CEU, I personally appreciate this university - contrary to many colleagues present here, I think. I personally collaborated with this university for many years. It has achievements in the field of social sciences, has brought interesting elements to the intellectual life of Central Europe, and interesting scientists work at this university. Of course, it also has a very clear ideological profile, which should not be concealed either. She does not hide it. But, as we know, in addition, its very controversial founder does not hide his political ambitions going so far that he would even like to reverse the result of democratic elections in some countries. I would like to remind you that the Member States have the right to regulate education, in particular to regulate the activities of foreign private universities. And I am convinced that in many Member States criticizing Hungary today the CEU could not be established.There are no institutions founded by George Soros in Germany, as far as I know, no Italy, no France, and that is no coincidence.Therefore, I would say our group is strongly opposed to any attempt to stigmatize Member States for no reason.However, I think that we should perhaps conduct a general debate here on the condition of universities in Europe, which have ceased to be diverse, have ceased to be a place of freedom, have become a place of conformism, repression directed against people who think differently, and the best example of this is the campaign against certain two university professorsin Berlin, which we all know about and whose example is known, and which is not of particular interest to colleagues in this room.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 24, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Guy VERHOFSTADT", "mepid": "97058", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Mr President, I would like to ask Prime Minister Orban whether he remembers the first time that we met. Mr Orban, it was in a hotel in Budapest in December 1989. I do not remember its name, but I remember our meeting because before it I had a meeting with SDSZ, the old Liberal Party, and then I asked you, as the leader of Fidesz, why you were not with your mother party in the meeting room and you explained why this was. I remember that it was just a few months before the successful participation of Fidesz in the first free elections in Hungary. By the way, at that time you were helped by George Soros – I remember that – and had a programme at that time that was more or less a little bit more progressive, I should say, than the programme of the SDSZ at that time. I would say that it was more social liberal and a little bit like Emmanuel Macron at that time. I would say that you were the Emmanuel Macron of Hungary in 1989. I do not think that Emmanuel Macron will be pleased with what I have said today. I did not say it in French so I hope that not much will be made of it.  But let us be honest: a lot has changed since 1990 and 1989 when we saw each other. You changed. You dumped your democratic principles and, in a certain way, you say openly that you want to create, not a liberal democracy, but that you want to have an illiberal state. At the moment the list of what you have done is a long one: harassing NGOs, chasing critical media away, building walls, your attempt to reinstate the death penalty in your country, even when this is not possible based on our treaties, and now you have decided to close down a university. I would ask you how far will you go? What is the next thing? Burning books on the square in front of the Hungarian Parliament, the so—called Lajos Kossuth Square? Will that be the next thing? Perhaps the books of Kartes or maybe of Konrad, perhaps the books of what is one of my favourite writers in Hungary, Sandor Marai, because Sandor Marai was a Hungarian cosmopolitan who you are attacking at the moment. When I look at you, you seem to be proud of this and to think that it is fantastic that I can say all this here. What I am seeing more and more is not a   proud conservative – because in the meanwhile you have become a proud conservative – but a sort of modern day version of the old communist Hungary – economic protectionism, excessive nationalism, the search for an illiberal state – and you see enemies of the Hungarian State everywhere. You see enemies in the energy sector, in the media, in the NGOs and now also in the academic world. It is like having Stalin or Brezhnev back, but now in Hungary. They also had that time of paranoia. It is not enough to have a majority in a democracy, but you have to chase them and go after them when they have another opinion. So, Mr Orban – and I will conclude with this – Hungary became a member of the European Union in 2004. You and your predecessors signed up to the values of the Union and you know all these principles very well. Even the left or the right in this House respect them. You have in fact violated every single one of these principles in the different cases that Mr Timmermans mentioned. Yet you want to remain a member of the European Union. Well I have in fact got more respect for the decency of Eurosceptics, who will at least say that they do not like the European Union and its values and that they are leaving. You want to continue getting money from the European funds, taking the European Union’s money, but you do not want the European values. They are not for you. What would you call that? Not very courageous, I should say, and certainly not in line with a politician based on principles. So my question to you is to ask whether you think that it is time to make a choice again, as you made that choice when you became, after being a Liberal Democrat, a little bit nationalist and a conservative? Is it not the time to ask yourself in your soul how you wish to be remembered in the future? Do you want to be remembered as somebody who liberated your country, Hungary, from communism – and you did that – or do you want to be commemorated as an eternal enemy of our open European democratic society? That is the choice that you have to make now.

It is normal for people who are involved in politics and who have grown up in different social epochs to change their position - to develop further, to open up. I believe that there are hardly known formative personalities in European history who have not gone through developments. I am thinking, for example, of Georg Lukács, someone I admire very much and who for me actually shapes Hungary - the proud Hungary you spoke of. A Hungary of democracy, freedom, openness and changes in the interests of the people who live there. You spoke of the people - of the Hungarian people who are so proud. I say: What is the people actually in your view? There are people living in Hungary, including migrants, including different ethnic groups, including the Roma. Is Hungary the country where all these people who are in your country want to live and work? Do they all have the same rights? Are they respected equally? Aren't they discriminated against? For me, that is the crucial question I want to ask you here. You speak of Soros. As a leftist, I am absolutely no friend of Soros. I don't have to justify myself there either. I am surprised that you address it that way because - is it true that you yourself were a Soros Fellow at Oxford? Then I am amazed by this combination that you are bringing now, and I think, if it is true, that you are really interested in the fact that the actual higher education law that has been passed is a LexCEU, so that it is primarily against this university, because the conditions that are set in the law apply to this one university, then one must ask oneself the question: What is happening here? Is this about the freedom of science? Is this about access to education, training, study, research and Science? Or is it ultimately about very simple, cheap return carriages? And I think that this cannot be carried out on the backs of students, teachers, people who are in the middle of their training, who have to consider whether they should even register for the next semester. We had the rector of the university here in Parliament yesterday. That doesn't agree with what you're saying. Perhaps by now he has understood what effects this law has on those affected. Two weeks ago 80,000 people took to the streets. It was not we in Hungary who protested there! It was your citizens who protested and said: We are losing something here. It is also about the fact that this university must remain part of academic life! For this we urge you: do your part to ensure that rights are protected! Check the NGO laws! They do not comply with international law, nor do they comply with many other things. Check your dealings with asylum seekers! This is not just about the laws that you pass nationally, it is also about international conventions that must be observed.

Prime Minister, I really appreciate your presence and indeed, as Manfred said, it is better to debate directly. Mr Orbán, we were actually born in the same year and I no longer recognise the defender of freedom and democracy that became known to me under your name back in 1989. We Greens also have our share of criticism for a number of political orientations of the European Union, but what I do not understand is when you start comparing the EU with the Soviet Union. Come on! If Brussels were Moscow, we would have tanks from the EU in London right now. We do not. On the contrary, I am struck by the fact that a number of the laws that you are passing in your country find their inspiration in Putin’s Moscow, which is hardly anyone’s dream, right? No, I really do not understand you because you have a privilege. Twice you enjoyed an overwhelming majority. Your people trusted you and I just imagine – you might laugh at me – but if my party enjoyed a two-thirds majority in any Member State – well, three times, I agree! – I would not be afraid of an independent press because it would stimulate the public debate in the country and mobilise the collective intelligence we need. I would not be afraid of a strong and independent judiciary, because checks and balances is what we need in democracy. I would not be afraid of a vibrant civil society, because it would help me spot problem areas that I need to solve. I would not be afraid of leading-edge universities because they would nurture talent in my country, and I would say ‘even better if some of the funding comes from abroad because it enriches my country.’ It is not just that I would not be afraid of these things, I would cherish them, because I think they would help to deliver a better society for my citizens. So what are you afraid of? A bit like Guy Verhofstadt said, since Hungary enjoys the financial solidarity of the EU, and rightfully so, it should abide by all the obligations of the EU, but this is not the first reason. The first reason is do these things, be an open society, because it is good for Hungary. Hungary will be stronger. Hungary will be a better place for its people by having a diversified free press, strong democratic checks and balances, a vibrant civil society and leading-edge universities. I would like to conclude with one thing, the refugee issue, and of course you expected me to do that. Mr Orbán, I must say that we are utterly appalled at the way your country has been treating refugees. True enough, Hungary sits in an uncomfortable situation at the outer border of the EU. But instead of directing your anger at refugees themselves, you should direct your energy towards your fellow EU Member States so that they help you in welcoming them. Mr Orbán – and you did it again today – you often refer to Christian values. Well, I must tell you one thing: as a Christian, I find nowhere in the Gospel that the stranger should be locked up and sent back. What I read there is that we should welcome and protect.

You are prepared again and again to come back here and to be attacked and abused by non-entities who want Hungary to bow to their will, and not to the will of the Hungarian people or its leader. I am beginning to wonder: at what point, sir, do you – as an intelligent man – stop banging your head up against a wall? You spoke today and you behaved today as the leader of a nation, but is it not becoming obvious that, as a member of the European Union, you are actually not a nation? Just as we are seeing in France at the moment, with huge interference in the French presidential election, even with the unelected Commission now coming out and backing this godlike creature called Macron. No, you are not the leader of a nation, and these people will go on interfering in the lives of Hungarian people, and you will never be forgiven. You are a sinner in their eyes, not just because you want to close down George Soros’ propaganda machine that masquerades as a university – nothing to do with that. It is because you will not pay the price for Ms Merkel’s supreme folly and sign up to migrant quotas, and they will never, ever forgive you for it.  Surely, since you yourself have said in the past that we need to get rid of a utopia called supranational Europe, it must become clear to you – as it became clear to eurosceptics in the United Kingdom – that this set of organisations, bound by their Treaties, are not open to reform. Institutions like this are led by fanatics. They are turning this into a state, and the nation state cannot coexist alongside. Now you were bold enough to call a referendum on the migrant quotas, and 88% of those that voted agreed with you.

Hungary - I say this to the Italians who follow me and to the Europeans - has a single tax of 16%; in Hungary, companies pay 9%, unemployment has dropped to 4%, youth unemployment is 11%, retire at 62, and the Hungarian people and government have had the strength to defend and control their currency, their central bank and their borders. What do we do? Are we sending them tanks like in 1956? Do we use sanctions instead of missiles? I remember that some Europeanists of today who cheer Europe and cheer Macron, for example Giorgio Napolitano, former President of the Italian Republic, when the Soviet tanks invaded Hungary, proud then as today, spoke of the Hungarians as fascists and thugs and invoked the intervention of Soviet tanks to safeguard world peace. It seems to me that nothing has changed in these sixty years.

A couple of years ago we started off with the constitution – media freedom, retirement age for judges. We have witnessed several unspeakably worded national consultations in the meantime. We have witnessed an attempt – or rather a vague idea – to reintroduce the death penalty, and all that coming from a man who is constantly referring to Christian values. It escapes me, Prime Minister, where the death penalty would be on any Christian agenda, and I have rarely found any Christian theologian who would have been able to find anything good about the death penalty. Now it is about a university, it is about NGOs, it is, above all, about the next national consultation. The NGO thing, Prime Minister, is not about transparency as we all know: it is in order to label NGOs that are foreign-funded as ‘foreign’, because they might carry foreign influence in Hungary, and foreign influence is bad. Now the only thing that comes to my mind in this context is if all foreign influence is so bad, why do you accept the payment of EUR 5 billion euros annually as a big net recipient of European structural funds in order to plaster the whole country with the posters in which you called Brussels crap? Somebody who does that, Prime Minister, leaves the Union out of their own accord.

I think it is appropriate for me to answer some important questions. First of all, thank you all for this debate. Thank you for watching Hungary and thank you for your opinion. Those who have supported Hungary, the Hungarian people and the decisions they have made here are also publicly supported, and I would also like to thank those representatives separately. Thank you for your solidarity. There were Hungarian speakers. I do not want to describe the behavior of Hungarians attacking their country here in Brussels, I am convinced that these debates should take place at home. I would like to say to Mr Verhofstadt that I have the impression that you want to tell us what the Hungarians need to do more than once. I ask you to entrust this to the Hungarian voters, who can decide this every four years. I would like to thank Vice-President Timmermans for the speech he has made. Thank you very much for offering an open and substantive dialogue, we are ready to discuss all the issues you have raised, and I see that we will easily find a solution in many of them. Unfortunately, I am also forced to react to my fellow Member, Mr Pittella, because I feel that he has treated me unfairly when he took his post harshly. Honorable Member, allow me to correct one of your thoughts: migrants do not want to go to Hungary. Migrants want to go to Austria, Germany and Sweden via Hungary. We are, in fact, defending Austria, Sweden and Germany. In fact, we are complying with the Schengen Agreement. And I find it strange that you, as a Member of the European Parliament, are attacking Hungary because Hungary is complying with the Schengen Treaty, not primarily for its own sake, but for the sake of the Germans, the Swedes and the Austrians. We Hungarians believe that we deserve recognition rather than an attack. The comments that are trying to resist my party in the European People's Party must tell you that this is one - if I hurt someone, I apologize, we know this well - this is an old communist tactic. You want to salami up the European People's Party. Apparently they want to salami up to make them stronger here afterwards. We know this, so democracy was destroyed in Hungary by the Communists. I advise the European People's Party not to accept this solution. Ladies and gentlemen, our position on migration is absolutely clear. Illegal immigration must be stopped, segregation between refugees and migrants must be carried out outside the territory of the European Union, and help must be taken to help people in distress where there is trouble, and not to bring people in distress into the European Union. Who doesn't make the relocations? My fellow Member, Mr Pittella, less than ten per cent have been relocated. It was not Hungary that did not take part in this, it only affected a thousand people. 10% of the specified frame number has been moved. It is clear that the policy of relocation, based on a mandatory quota, has failed. It is unnecessary to force it, because states that do not oppose it openly to us do not implement it either. That was a bad idea. If a bad political idea turns out to have failed, it should be stopped and another solution is worth looking for. I also have a word about money. Look, the money Hungary receives from the European Union is not a donation. Cohesion policy is good for everyone. Every single Member State of the European Union is doing well. You also earn on it, those who give the money, they also earn on it. Not a little. Let's talk about this openly! Net contributors are beneficiaries of cohesion policy. That is what your Commissioners are talking about openly. They also say numbers, I do not recall how much money is given to us percent goes back to your country. I am convinced that this is cohesion policy, that is the right thing to do. We dismantled tariffs, opened our markets and allowed the free flow of capital while we were as poor after communism, as scarce as capital as the church mouse. I am convinced that there is no fair competition without cohesion policy. You cannot ask us, ladies and gentlemen, to shut up and talk to us as if you were giving us a gift and we are your purchased commitments. We cannot accept this position, Hungary must reject it. As for Hungary being a kind of authoritarian political system, and thanks to me personally, although this is obviously not about me, but about the ten million Hungarians, I would like to inform you that I have spent 16 years in opposition in parliament and am just starting to 12th year of government. And I am one of the few European leaders who, when he lost, did not go into business, did not sit on well-paying boards, did not give guest lectures for huge sums. When we lost, my party and I personally, we stayed in politics and took on opposition debates and fought and regained people’s trust. To blame such a country, and such a governing party, for authoritarian regimes, and to mention authoritarian countries for us / us, I think is quite simply not fair and not fair. Ladies and Gentlemen, I think of many things, I think of many things about György Soros, but not that he has ever given a scholarship to anyone in his life because he thought he would have bought his opinion for life. So I also have to reject the assumptions about that. And finally, I must say a word about illiberal democracy, as you have mentioned. It is that in Central Europe it they believe that if liberals do not win or are not part of the government, there is no democracy.We have had enough of this.The truth is that we think that if the liberals do not win, there can still be democracy.Illiberal democracy is when non-liberals win.Thank you for your kind attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 54, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Frans TIMMERMANS", "mepid": "129141", "text": "   First Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, at the conclusion of this debate, let me draw a few conclusions for the Commission. I will be looking forward to the reply by the Hungarian authorities to the notification we have sent on the law on higher education. In our view, this law is clearly in violation of EU law, so I hope we can get a response to that.  I have to say that the only thing the Central European University is asking is to be left alone to do what it does well. I come from a country where, for centuries, Hungarian scholars came to study and also to enrich my country. We live in a European Union where, through the Erasmus programme, the cross-fertilisation of young minds across the European Union is one of the biggest assets of this European Union and one of the biggest success stories.  We should cherish this academic freedom, this exchange of ideas, and this way of promoting a vision of the world that is open to other views.  With regard to other views, I fully respect different visions and opinions about the future of the European Union. Everybody is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts. I know we live in a time when very often, when we have strong opinions and they are not in line with the facts, we assume that the facts must be wrong but, on this specific case, the Commission will stick to the facts. I would be grateful to the Hungarian authorities if, in their procedure on ‘Stop Brussels’, they would take into account the facts we have presented in reaction to the questions put to the Hungarian population. I think we deserve that. That is how we work in the European Union. I look forward to continuing to work with Hungary in this.  Regarding this debate, we are not going to solve these issues only by taking legal steps. The Commission will take legal steps when legal steps are warranted, when the Treaties are violated, but we will only reach a consensus or an idea of where we need to go collectively in the European Union if we have a debate.  If you will allow me, Mr President, I want to make one remark. From the extreme right, because of their lack of arguments, we only get insults. Since nobody reacted, I want to react: I was deeply, deeply aggravated by the vile attack by Ms Von Storch on Stockholm and on Sweden. I think this is completely unacceptable.

It is not just about consumers who consume, it is about citizens, real people, who are trying to make a living, getting their kids through school, struggling for a better future. Europe has a role in protecting and strengthening the rights of all our people, and we are not a day too late in doing so. In the wake of the White Paper on the Future of Europe, the first reflection paper on the social dimension has now been published, setting out scenarios on what choices we could make together. We are also here today to speak about the Pillar of Social Rights and the principles that we believe are important to help Member States to reform and together converge upwards. Valdis Dombrovskis will give a detailed presentation on both the Reflection Paper and the Pillar, and Marianne Thyssen will conclude the debate on behalf of the Commission. For now, let me focus on one of the initiatives we are bringing forward to put the principles of the Pillar into action. It is a joint proposal by Marianne Thyssen and Věra Jourová that I wish to attach great importance to and of which I am frankly very proud. The Commission today adopted an ambitious new initiative to support the work-life balance of parents and carers. With this package of legislative and non-legislative action, we want to increase women’s participation and representation in the labour market and ensure they are not obliged anymore to choose between a family or a professional career. And this is not just about women, it is about men as well. Existing policies have not brought equal opportunities that allow fathers and mothers to work in care together for the welfare of their children, elders and society at large. Today, the employment gap between men and women is more than 11%, and in full-time equivalent it goes above 18%, because part-time workers are mainly women. When families have young children, the gap widens hugely. Women also spend five times more time than men on care and household activities. This explains partly the pay gap of 16% and the pension gap of 40%, which increases women’s exposure to poverty and economic dependence. The main drivers of the problem relate to parenthood, the unequal share of care responsibilities, the shortage of childcare and long-term care facilities and financial disincentives in tax benefit systems for the second earner.  The economic loss due to the gender employment gap is estimated to be around EUR 370 billion per year. In the context of demographic aging, we cannot afford to leave this huge talent untapped. This is a social and an economic imperative and of course, above all, a moral imperative.  Our proposal, once adopted, will repeal the Parental Leave Directive to replace it by a directive on work-life balance for parents and carers. We propose maintaining the existing four months’ parental leave entitlement for each parent, but paid at sick pay level and non-transferable. We introduce a paternity leave of 10 days and care leave of five days per year and per dependent relative, also paid at sick pay level, and we also extend and modernise the use of flexible work arrangements. At the same time, we will promote the provision of affordable and quality formal care services across the Union, including by optimising the use of available EU financial support. We will ensure better implementation and effective enforcement of the protection against dismissal, provide guidance to Member States and monitor the development of their work-life balance policies.  Honourable Members, we must stop wasting all that female talent and give fathers a real chance to be with their children as well. We are in times when we see around us a so-called cultural counter-revolution emerging, throwing us back into the past, often to the detriment of women. I am more than convinced that we need this package now. I do not want my daughters to be in the same situation as my grandmothers were. Europe is not telling anyone how to live. There is not one right balance, but I do not accept that our daughters have to fight again the battle that their grandmothers won. Work-life balance is about a real choice for fathers and mothers on how to organise their lives. This is our message: it is great to be a mum, it is cool to be a dad, and it is fantastic to be able to combine both roles with a carer.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 72, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Valdis DOMBROVSKIS", "mepid": "28618", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, today the Commission adopted its first reflection paper as part of five contributions announced in the Commission’s White Paper on the broader debate on the future of Europe. It is fitting that the first reflection paper covers the social dimension as that is something that is close to the heart of every citizen. Since the adoption of the Treaty of Rome, the European social dimension has been the founding principle of European integration. It should bring social progress and real benefits for people and has been the cornerstone of the European Union’s success. Our aim today is no different. We have come a long way in 60 years. We should be proud that our social model is a success. Europe is home to the most equal societies in the world. The reflection paper provides an overview of the social realities in Europe and the challenges awaiting us. Digitalisation, globalisation and demographic transformation are already making their impact felt and will only deepen with time. New working patterns, often based on freelance or self—employment, increasingly also in the collaborative economy and online platforms, all add to the need to revisit our social acquis. The Rome Declaration emphasises the need for a social Europe, based on sustainable growth which promotes economic and social progress, as well as cohesion and convergence. It is time to look ahead at what kind of social Europe we want, what kind of future we want for ourselves, for our children and, more importantly, how we want to achieve this. Who will be taking what responsibility? We propose to look at three options: limiting the social dimension to free movement only, progress in the field of the coalition of the willing Member States – which could be the euro area, but also another grouping of countries – and deepening the social dimension of Europe together with all 27 Member States. All these options are feasible within current treaties and of course mix-and-match is possible. The scope of the reflection paper is to present a wide approach to social issues. It does not reflect the Commission’s preferred option at this point. We look forward to continuing this debate with you and other stakeholders in the coming months. But today’s package is not only about reflection. Today we have presented a European Pillar of Social Rights. This proves that social Europe is not a purely theoretical principle, but an evolving reality on the ground. By delivering on the promise to reinforce the social dimension of the European Union, we are making a difference in the lives of our citizens. The essence of our proposal is the following: investing in people is investing in their future as well as in our economy. The social dimension is needed to create a resilient economy and sustainable growth, and to strengthen our competitiveness. With our initial European Pillar of Social Rights we set out to do just that. More than a year ago we presented the first outline of the European Pillar of Social Rights and, in the course of far—reaching consultations, we listened and took on board the suggestions expressed by governments, national parliaments, stakeholders, social partners and citizens across Europe. All in all, we had more than 16 000 replies. In particular, I would like to thank you for your far—reaching report last January. Today these contributions are crystallised in our proposal with 20 principles and rights. The central objective remains that the Pillar should be a reference framework to drive the process of reforms at national level. More specifically, it will serve as a compass for a new renewal process of both economic and social upward convergence. As was announced from the start, the Pillar is primarily conceived for the euro area, but is open to all EU Member States. Indeed we are proposing to adopt it through a joint proclamation with the Parliament and the Council as EU institutions and we hope that all Member States will be part of it. The Pillar is essentially a joint endeavour. Those of you with long memories will remember that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU was adopted in 2000 via an interinstitutional proclamation by the Parliament, Council and Commission. We aim to reach a political endorsement at the highest level of this proclamation in the second half of this year. The First Vice-President has already elaborated on one of the specific initiatives accompanying the Social Pillar, but we are bringing forward three other accompanying initiatives to put the principle into action. The Commission is responding to your request for a framework directive on decent working conditions in all forms of employment by consulting social partners on two possible initiatives. Firstly, on ways to better align our social security system with the new forms of work. We want to ensure that as many people as possible, including the self-employed and gig economy workers, are covered and can build up rights against their social contributions. Secondly, by modernising EU rules on what needs to be spelt out in a job contract through the revision of the Written Statement Directive. More specifically, we want to ensure clarity for workers and employers on their contractual relationship irrespective of the type of contract. For both initiatives we would like to give social partners the possibility to look for mutually acceptable solutions before considering any legislative steps. Lastly, we are issuing guidelines to help provide national legislators and employers with a clearer picture on what counts as working time, what happens to untaken paid annual leave with the interpretative communication of the Working Time Directive. We are also responding to your request to ensure better monitoring by issuing a social scoreboard. This will expand the existing scoreboard of key economic and social indicators used in the European Semester to better take into account social considerations. It will also help us show progress towards a triple-A social Europe. Our proposals pave the way for a balanced project that allows all of us –citizens, politicians, entrepreneurs and businesses – to reap the benefits of today’s modern reality. Let me be clear, however: our aim is not to legislate on every aspect of the Pillar. The red thread running through the Pillar is subsidiarity. EU institutions, social partners and all levels of government have joint competence and joint responsibility to make sure competitiveness and social progress go hand in hand. I count on your support to make the European Pillar of Social Rights a reality.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 73, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Françoise GROSSETÊTE", "mepid": "2025", "text": "on behalf of the PPE Group. - Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the two Vice-Presidents of the Commission and Commissioner Marianne Thyssen for presenting this ambitious initiative.

It is true that there is an urgent need to meet the need to protect our fellow citizens in a changing world of work. It is also important to support those whom life makes more vulnerable, as well as to strive for a greater convergence of our social norms in order to fight against the dumpings that fuel Euroscepticism. All of this, of course, while respecting subsidiarity. However, the best social policy is a return to employment, because only growth can bring about lasting social progress. What is the point of talking endlessly about growth if not to redistribute the benefits? Our group is heir to the Christian democracy which gave so many founding fathers to Europe, this Europe which was itself deeply imbued with them.

The European Parliament will certainly be ready to co-sign a proclamation on this European Pillar of Social Rights for all European citizens, because for the European Parliament we cannot have first-class citizens or second-class citizens. But we are willing to move in this direction and that is why we call on all governments also to co-sign such a proclamation and such a commitment. But what really matters is the commitment to deliver on better social standards for our century. We need to make sure that we are really meeting the new conditions of labour markets and welfare systems, to fit them for the future. Our citizens are waiting for this. That is why the Pillar must deliver on best conditions first of all to provide a good future for children in Europe. We cannot have children in poverty. That is why we need to have a Youth Guarantee delivering more and better jobs for the best generation we have in Europe. That is why we need to have these new leave schemes, paid schemes, for both men and women to take care of their children and their relatives, and most of all, that is why we need to make sure that all people in employment, whatever their kind of job, they have a clear set of working conditions and they have access to social protection. This is really to prepare our welfare systems for the future. But in order to deliver this, we need to have real means in order to have a credible social pillar, and real means implies that even of course social partners should be consulted. The European Commission should also be ready to table labour and social law when this is needed. We need European action to create these common standards. Secondly, we need to make sure that the European Semester will bring about real upward economic and social conversions by monitoring standards, economic and social policies. And finally, we need to have the financial instruments to underpin all this convergence.

In a global comparison, the EU already has very high social standards. That's nice, but also expensive. You also have to be able to afford the social pillar. Given the economic situation in the EU, additional concerns are a risk. They can weaken companies' competitive positions and hinder investment. Problems can arise in the weaker countries of the euro zone and Eastern Europe. Smaller companies will be more affected than big ones. We fear that the social indicators will be used to standardize further areas and to draw more competencies to the European level. After many years of cohesion policy, the competitiveness of the Member States has hardly adjusted and has not improved. While some of the stronger countries could afford additional rules and thus costs, the weaker countries or even smaller companies often cannot. While industrial companies from stronger countries could then benefit because their competition is weakened, the call for more intra-European transfers and a higher burden on the taxpayer, for example with a European unemployment insurance or other stabilization elements for the euro zone, is likely to follow. If the EU weakens the competitive zone of individual states, it must also take responsibility for it. And that's exactly what we don't want. The EU must respect the principle of subsidiarity.

You are going to continue in the langue of Cervantès. It is a joy that the starting gun to build more and better Europe that has been chosen is precisely social Europe. If you tell me it is a coincidence, then better the coincidence. It is very important, indeed, that we now understand that we must once again have a critical mass of citizens who believe in the European project as a project that will serve the citizens - because we are in a moment of crisis, nobody it escapes him—, and obviously to work in the social sphere: Europeanizing the social is fundamental. And for that, of course, what is proposed here is to jointly study the creation of a pillar of social rights. In other words, it is essential to know what being a European will mean in terms of social rights, with those twenty questions that the Commission puts on the table where we will work for an interinstitutional agreement. We are going to define a key aspect of European citizenship. Then other things are said, such as respect for subsidiarity. This will be the case, of course, at the time of putting into practice, of course, the rights, which will be universal and above states, regions and whatever. For which we are building society. It will also be necessary to appeal to solidarity. They say here with good reason: all this costs money. Yes, and have a common defense, too. And have a common currency, too. And with the same right, solidarity, the distribution of temporary funds or not, will be necessary to build a social Europe and ensure that everyone enjoys what is minimally required for one of the most prosperous areas of the world; and for this I must propose, from the point of view of the ALDE Group, three more objectives, and with this I finish.Let's not forget to be effective immediately against poverty.That it is intolerable that it exists in Europe.Above all the great poverty.Second, let us always support mobility as a fundamental right of workers.And thirdly, social policy is much more than employment, in my country, for example, employment is so important.Social policy is to be able to enjoy a decent education, a decent home.And all that, which costs money, is done much better when we are all united, and that is why we will work with the Commission in the most inclusive of the three scenarios.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 79, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Rina Ronja KARI", "mepid": "122885", "text": "for the GUE / NGL Group. -  Sir.

Instead, they have become larger due to the EU's austerity policy and the European Semester. The many demands from there that there must be cuts in welfare, that we must have a higher retirement age and a poorer social security, yes it has social consequences. It has made the crisis much worse for our socially disadvantaged citizens. Therefore, I also find it deeply worrying that what has been presented here today consists first and foremost of nice words that have not been followed up by action. There is a need for a clear break with the austerity policy. This means that budgetary frameworks and the constant pursuit of increased labor supply must no longer have priority.

We have great, pressing challenges in Europe: increasing inequality, poverty, globalization, digitization and demographic change.

Europe needs more than a non-binding social etiquette - the twenty principles that the Commission has put down are very good in terms of content, but most of them are already written down somewhere.

Let me first address some of the key issues in this discussion. The pillar we launched today is just the start of a process. It is indeed a pillar of 20 principles and values and rights. It is something that we will use from day one as a reference framework to screen the employment and social policy in Member States and at European level, and a guidance, a compass, to guide us to more convergence, to upward convergence, towards better employment and social conditions – also working conditions – for our citizens, and it is indeed more than words, words, words. That is the reason why we immediately proposed and launched today some concrete deliverable proposals for legislation or concrete starting first—phase consultations with the social partners.  Regarding the request of the European Parliament for legislation, and also for a framework directive on decent working conditions, we agree that it is important to ensure that all forms of employment enjoy a minimum set of rights and protection. This is perhaps the main outcome from our public consultation: to adapt the social acquis to the new world of work. I want to reassure you that this objective is addressed in the two partner consultations we are launching: the one on the written statement directive, and the other one on access to social protection. If social partners cannot agree – you never know – then the Commission stands ready to table proposals. You have seen now, with the proposal on the work-life balance, that we have the courage and we have the determination to do so.  It is important to recognise that the Commission cannot legislate on everything. In fact, the guiding principle of this Commission has been that we do not legislate for the sake of it. For example, we are not reopening the Working Time Directive: we are issuing guidance to improve its implementation. Indeed, we will proceed on a two-prong approach. On the one hand, we will step up our monitoring of the existing acquis, and on the other hand, we will enhance guidance to help Member States to help enterprises to implement it.  On the work-live balance (I will be short on this because time is running), you will see that we go beyond maternity and beyond childcare. I see in this House that there are different opinions. We have put an ambitious proposal on the table, and I hope for quick and constructive consideration by the co—legislators so that we can soon have a good directive.  We are in the midst of an economic and social transition. The social fallout from the crisis remains present, and the resulting political pressure at all political levels is massive. Above all, this demands a clear and a commonly shared idea of what the European Union can and cannot do in this field. There is an economic, social and political urgency to make the European Pillar of Social Rights a success. First, the economic arguments: we need a modern labour market, we need social protection, and we need education systems to drive upward convergence, and we need to get more and better qualified people into the labour force. This is the way to build resilience, and this is the way to make our economies competitive and our welfare systems sustainable in the longer term.  Second, there are the social arguments. The labour market is a vehicle for inclusion, to improve people’s life chances and to help them to fulfil their potential. The best way to make people feel valued is through a high—quality job. We need to make sure that everyone can participate, and that no one is left behind. Third, there is the political imperative of tackling inequalities. Our political resilience – our resilience too – depends on restoring a sense of fairness, of opportunity, and of empowerment. I therefore count on your support to make the European Pillar of Social Rights a reality. On the reflection paper, the debate on the future of Europe, it is open. President Juncker launched the White Paper on this debate, and we are now feeding the debate with concrete reflection documents. The first one, not par hasard, is on social policy. We will have others on the deepening of the Economic and Monetary Union, on defence, on globalisation and on the financing of the European Union. So the debate is open and we will deliver more reflection papers to feed the debate – and of course we hope, Thomas Mann, that as many people as possible participate in this important debate, and in the one on the future of Europe.

Our relations with Turkey unfortunately have still not reached calm waters. You have all seen the news coming from Turkey even today, and many of you have commented on it. We have stressed on many occasions that it is Turkey’s sovereign right to let its citizens vote on whether to have a parliamentary or a presidential system. However, the constitutional reform and the circumstances in which the referendum took place are a matter of concern, for three reasons. First, we share the very serious concerns of the Venice Commission with regard to the proposed constitutional changes. This is something we stated clearly before the vote. Once the constitutional changes are fully implemented, Turkey will move even further away from European standards, especially with regard to the separation of powers and the independence of the judiciary. Second, the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE has noted that the vote did not take place on a level playing field. The two sides did not have equal opportunities to campaign. Turkish voters were not provided with impartial or balanced information about the amendments they were voting on. Also, the ongoing state of emergency has curtailed fundamental freedoms that are essential to a genuinely democratic process. The final OSCE/ODIHR report will be published in the next few days. It will now be crucial that all allegations of irregularities on Election Day are addressed through transparent investigations. It is always essential that democratic processes are fair and free; but this is even more crucial when deep constitutional changes are at stake. Our constitutions define the common rules of the game: if these rules are not recognised and accepted by everyone, the whole system becomes weaker. Third, the electoral campaign has left Turkey’s population deeply divided. The two sides disagree about the fundamental direction in which they would like to see their country move. The close referendum result makes the need to seek a broad consensus all the more important. I clearly see this as a way forward. Accusations and rhetorical aggressions flourished between the two campaigning sides within Turkey, but also between Turkish representatives and international actors. It is in the interest of Turkey to mend such an internal division, and it is in the interest of everyone to engage more constructively on the international arena. The cooperation between Turkey and the Council of Europe is of paramount importance and has produced some results already. This work needs to be carried on and further deepened. We continue to encourage Turkey to address the Council of Europe’s concerns and recommendations, including with regard to the State of Emergency. Security and fundamental freedoms can go together and must go together, in the interest of all Turkish citizens. The question at stake now is what this means for EU-Turkey relations and their future. The time has come for an open and friendly discussion with Turkey about the future of our relationship. We will have a first opportunity after the referendum to exchange views on the way forward together with the European Union Foreign Ministers at the Gymnich meeting in two days’ time in Malta. We therefore look forward to hearing your views and will be very interested to hear your interventions.

If we are discussing relations between the European Union and Turkey today, then we have to look back a little further - at least to the coup of almost a year ago, when Erdoğan himself and thousands of Turkish citizens opposed the military, bravely democracy and defended the freedom of the country and thus kept Ataturk's words alive; I quote: “Political power that relies solely on cannons will not be sustained.” Perhaps back then, in the days after the coup, we did not pay enough attention to the developments, to the struggle for freedom and democracy too little appreciated. Already at that time, unfortunately, Erdoğan gave God's impression that he would use this coup and the developments afterwards to maintain his power. The defense of freedom and democracy would actually have been the start to lead Turkey into a new phase of democracy and the rule of law. Unfortunately, we now experience that the opposite is the case. We all know what happened and what happened next: 40,000 people arrested, 100,000 fired from public service, 170 media outlets closed, 100 journalists in prison, and more than 1,000 police officers fired last night - one another massive intervention. Now the referendum. The OECD with clear statements on this: Fairness was not guaranteed. Democracy is not only practiced if you count the numbers, if you properly count the election papers, but democracy also means that fairness already takes place in the media process. In this respect, Erdoğan has now achieved his goal, but the price he is paying is a high one: Turkey is now a divided country, the economy has suffered massive damage, and many friends have been insulted encountered, the external relationships are damaged. Now we have to discuss how to proceed. Dear friends, In view of the situation in Turkey, there is no such thing as “business as usual” for us. Unfortunately, Erdoğan's path closes the door to partnership with the European Union. Turkey is going in the wrong direction. Everyone has to see that who opens their eyes. It's time to reevaluate and clarify the relationship. And I would also like to answer the question that the Commissioner put to us: From the point of view of the EPP Group, full membership in the European Union is no longer realistic. We must now end the lie that prevails in relationships. I even believe that one can even go so far that the promise of enlargement that we made in 2004 caused more damage than it used. On the Turkish side, I have seen many partners in recent years who have told me: Your offer is not really meant to be honest. The EU will never accept us. It's a promise that was never meant to be honest. And that has led to anger and rejection in Turkey. And in Europe? In Europe, I have to tell you that Boris Johnson distributed flyers in the Brexit campaign where he portrayed Turkey, Syria and Iraq as possible future EU member states - it was a lie, but the fear that this Europe would have no borders is unsettling the people in Europe. Therefore, we should end the lie of full membership of Turkey now. The Council needs to have such a policy discussion. Donald Tusk as Council President has to travel to Ankara. We have to talk to each other about how we will shape future relationships, and the basis for the future partnership is honesty - to describe what is possible, but also what is not, and also to clarify our position: We do not want to close the door. The EPP Group wants to make an offer.The customs union, for example, the customs union plus, which the Commission has already proposed - perhaps we can also expand it: more economic cooperation, opening doors for students on visas, improving exchanges for people - yes, we say yes to that.We will also have to work more closely together in the fight against terrorism, against ISIS and so on.In terms of refugee policy, we have shown that sectoral cooperation makes sense - that both sides see the benefits.We want to go this way.We need a restart of relations, of the partnership with Turkey on the basis of honesty, and that means ending the accession talks and opening a new chapter in sectoral cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 140, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Kati PIRI", "mepid": "37229", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group. – Mr President, the referendum result last week in Turkey shows that democracy is not dead. On the contrary, despite the unfair electoral environment, the intimidation of the No campaigners and the massive control of the media by the government, half of Turkey’s population showed that they are ready to push back for the democratic future of their country. The EU must fiercely support those forces. The international observation mission was clear in its assessment: this was not a fair election. The controversial decision of the electoral council to allow last-minute on-stand ballots to be counted in also raised serious questions about whether these elections were free. I therefore welcome the Commission’s stance that it will insist on an independent investigation into the alleged irregularities. But 16 April was also a sad day for all democrats because it is clear that, with such a Constitution, Turkey cannot become a member of the EU. As I stated in the draft annual report I published today, the EU should officially suspend the accession process if the constitutional changes are implemented unchanged. Having said that, we have to be vigilant that justified criticism of Erdogan’s policies does not turn into anti-Turkish sentiment, as we sometimes, unfortunately, see in this House. There are millions of people in Turkey who do share the same European values and millions who do want the EU to remain the anchor for reforms in their country. I therefore do not agree with those in this Parliament who want to scrap Turkey, once and for all, as an EU candidate country. In Turkey, changes are possible in the future and I continue to believe in a joint future for Turkey and the EU. But I am also realistic and acknowledge that this is unlikely to happen under the current political leadership in Turkey. Even if talks are suspended, Turkey-EU relations remain in our joint interest. Cooperation should therefore continue in several areas. However, that cannot be a value-free transactional relationship only, where human rights and democracy are no longer important. To achieve this, we can use the economic power of the EU as leverage for promoting reforms in Turkey, for instance, by adding clear political benchmarks to the upgrade of the Customs Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 141, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Syed KAMALL", "mepid": "33569", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Group. – Madam President, let us be honest today. Across this House most – if not all – of us share concerns over the current direction of the Turkish Government under President Erdogan. Maybe some speakers today will try to out-compete each other in their condemnations, or even – as the previous speaker said – their insults. Yes, we all share concerns over press freedom in Turkey. Yes, we all share concerns over the treatment of the opposition and the conduct of the referendum; and we all share concerns over President Erdogan seeking to grab more executive power for what has, up to now, been largely a ceremonial presidency. However, many in this House also realise that, at times, we need to work with Turkey. We need to work with Turkey when it comes to controlling the flows of refugees and migrants and we need to work with Turkey on regional security as an important member of NATO. We need to work with Turkey as we share concerns over issues such as Russian aggression. So, in reality, we are talking about a difficult balancing act and this balancing act needs two things. Firstly, we need to be honest with Turkey that it may never be a member of the EU. There are too many concerns: prejudice against a largely Muslim population; a landmass which lies mostly in Asia; the prospect of freedom of movement for millions of Turks; the prospect of voting weights in the Council and here in this Parliament; and an EU external border which would be with countries such as Iran, Iraq and Syria. Secondly, we need to have a more robust and critical relationship between Turkey and the EU.  But in seeking both, the EU has to ask itself: is the EU ready for the consequences of Turkey possibly opening its borders with Greece and allowing people to transit to the EU, and of President Erdogan seeing himself being pushed into the arms of countries such as Russia or Iran? So, while Turkey is not ready for EU membership – and it is not even ready for visa liberalisation – completely turning our back on Turkey is not an option. This is why the ECR Group welcomes calls for a different kind of relationship with Turkey. It will be a difficult balancing act requiring much diplomacy. It may be a more difficult relationship, but it will be a more honest relationship – more cautious, more critical, focused more on cooperation and no longer on the distant goal of EU membership.

What is more important is what you have asked us: what our view is in the light of the Gymnich meeting. Together with Mr Weber, I have published a common op-ed article, you could say, on that in a number of newspapers, because I think it is critical now to go into a new cooperation and to make a new proposal to Turkey. I think that we have to stop accession negotiations. In fact, they are no longer accession negotiations; they are in fact suspended – not formally suspended, but, in fact, suspended. The only thing we are doing is still paying EUR 650 million every year for the pre—accession process, and it does not help these people in Turkey, journalists, or civil society in general. On the contrary, I think that continuing this so-called not formally suspended ‘accession’ is a cover-up that even makes it possible for some people in the Turkish authorities to further clamp down on civil society, on journalists, on the opposition, and so on. Our proposal is to reconsider that and ask: why not do what is in the Treaty? The Treaty says that we can make association agreements with neighbourhood countries. Why not make a new association agreement and propose to Turkey such a new association agreement where you have two chapters: one chapter on economics, trade, Customs Union (we could propose an offer of an upgraded Customs Union, even further than what is on the table now); and at the same time, the second track, if on the Turkish side they open civil society, they agree to restore democracy in a certain sense. I do not want to call it a ‘Helsinki Process’ and to make a comparison to the strategy we followed with the Soviet Union (your remember that), but, in a certain way, that is what it is: a two—track approach. We should then use the EUR 640 or 650 million to help civil society there as a part of such a new strategy.

In particular, the indirect threat to the Dutch, where Erdogan listed the number of Turkish inhabitants in the Netherlands and the number of soldiers in the Dutch army, was the closest we come to a shameless direct threat to a European democracy. Therefore, the time has not come for us to reward Turkey. The time has come for us to show Turkey that the behavior they have shown should have a consequence, also on the trade front. That is why I hope that we will take this as an element not only to suspend the accession negotiations, but also to allow consequences of such behavior towards European friendly allied nations.", "language": "en", "original_language": "da", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 151, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Takis HADJIGEORGIOU", "mepid": "96907", "text": "GUE / NGL). - Madam President, Mr Hahn, the question you have raised is very important: 'what should we do?', And the question that arises is what message should the European Union send to Turkey today?

The result in itself was highly dubious, given the accusations of electoral fraud. But even so, a large number of Turks voted against democracy and in favour of a form of dictatorship. Now that is bad enough, but what is interesting and highly disturbing are the voting figures for Turkish citizens living in Europe who had an overseas vote. Despite a narrow majority being achieved overall, those Turks voting in Europe voted by large majorities for Mr Erdoğan’s proposals. In France and Germany that was over 60%, and in the Netherlands, Austria and Belgium, that was over 70%. So in Turkey while half the voters chose to vote for democracy, those Turks living in Western liberal democracies voted by a large majority to abolish it. Perhaps those Turkish voters living in Europe might vote for a form of Islamic authoritarianism in Europe, given the chance. The logical conclusion of this vote is that those Turks living in Europe who voted for dictatorship and against democracy should have the courage of their convictions to live by their decision. They should migrate back to Turkey to enjoy the benefits of what they just voted for. And what if Turkey’s bid to join the EU had been successful? That application was supported by the EU, and in the UK by the Conservative, Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green parties. MEPs from those parties always voted in favour of Turkish accession. Needless to say, only UKIP MEPs voted against it. If Turkey had joined the EU, then we would now be faced with an interesting situation.

Turkey could use the Council of Europe’s decision to reintroduce human rights monitoring as guidance to this end. We wish to help Turkey by remaining engaged with it, by keeping channels open. We must continue to promote the values on which our Union is based, and help those who stand up for them. Concretely, we already do this on a multitude of levels; ranging from high-level political dialogues to our aid to a stronger and independent judiciary, or protection of human rights defenders. We must continue our principled engagement with Turkey and continue doing our part to support the positive currents in Turkish civil society. Second, in the long term, we need to see how we can further build our multifaceted relations and use opportunities together. I take today’s debate as a strong signal from this House that business as usual is not an option at all, but that we must equally not fall into the trap of artificial debates or rash actions either. Yes, Turkey is very important to us, with common interests ranging from geopolitics right down to the many human links. But Turkey needs the EU much, much more – politically, economically and, may I say, security-wise. I therefore want us to keep a cool head and together devise a more rational strategy, a format or ‘package’ if you will, that enables us to work with Turkey on the many areas of mutual interest and gives us real leverage to boost democracy, fundamental rights and reforms. Again, we must move away from the status quo, which is only frustrating for both sides. Together, across the European Union, we must send a clear signal that the European Union is committed to continuing an open and constructive dialogue with a democratic, inclusive and stable Turkey, but that we will equally not budge from our red lines. The aim must be to find a future-oriented functioning set-up together, and finally, in close cooperation with Turkey.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 178, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Sylvie GUILLAUME", "mepid": "96952", "text": "The debate is closed.Written statements (Article 162)", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 179, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Lorenzo CESA", "mepid": "28451", "text": "in writing.- On April 16, the Turkish people, after a very long electoral campaign, spoke out on the Constitutional Referendum.The result obtained, however, highlighted a profound fracture in society.The European Union is now at a crossroads.The continuation of the EU accession talks has become the subject of political bargaining.The EU must move towards an association agreement aimed at improving existing relations and enabling the intensification of political, economic and security cooperation.It takes courage and vision: this is what we are asking today from the Council and the High Representative for the Union's foreign policy.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 180, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Angel DZHAMBAZKI", "mepid": "124873", "text": "In written form. - The referendum on constitutional reform in Turkey is another and probably the last blow to the republic built by Mustafa Kemal Ataturk.

These latest reports suggest that the current regime in Turkey is clearly not a standard democracy. The regime is gradually moving away from Atatürk's legacy in two fundamental respects: it weakens the role of the military, which has always been the guardian of the secular regime, and strengthens the influence of Islam in public life.

That is why the European Union must prove to all those who voted against it during the referendum that it will not accept the collapse of democracy in Turkey and will continue to support the promotion of democratic values.

It is particularly worrying that voters did not receive objective information on key aspects of the reform. On the other hand, the very even result in the referendum shows a deep division in Turkish society. The Venice Commission of the Council of Europe has expressed serious concerns regarding both the content and the implementation of the constitutional amendments.

It was already in November 2015 that the European Commission came with a new and unique European broad support program for structural reforms in the period 2017-2020. I will continue in Dutch, because I prepared my text in Dutch and will read it out carefully. - After the Council and Parliament decided their position and after four productive trilogues between the European Commission, the Council and the European Parliament, we have reached a compromise for the first reading that is now before us. The budget for the program is set at 142 million euros. The budget comes from the resources of the European Structural and Investment Funds for technical assistance. During these trilogues, the rapporteurs, Constanze Krehl, and the undersigned, ensured that a number of important principles of practice, cohesion and regional policy are integrated into that new assistance program. Thus, the partnership principle has been incorporated. Not only the Member States have an important role when it comes to structural reforms. Regional authorities - in Spain, Germany, for example - are essential in initiating and implementing structural changes. Therefore, Member States must coordinate with their regions so that support is tailored to those national and regional needs. The spirit of the partnership is clearly captured in the text. In addition, we from Parliament have underlined the importance of transparency. The cooperation and support plan drawn up with the Commission for each Member State concerned should therefore be shared as soon as possible with all, with Parliament and with all interested parties in order to be able to monitor and assess the added value of this support program. Because that's what it's all about. Not yet another separate sectoral program for structural, administrative and institutional reforms. No, a clear link with the support that the Member States already receive and their own responsibility for the European Structural and Investment Funds. Three quarters of the so-called country-specific recommendations are already supported by the regional funds. Consider, for example, the need to continue to improve public procurement in many of our Member States. In the EU, it is therefore about achieving coherence between all these types of instruments and not yet another new fifth wheel. Accelerate together with additional support for broader scope, such as the fight against fraud, corruption and money laundering, to set an example. This also increases the effect of the existing instruments and funds. It makes no sense to keep pumping money into regions or countries that don't have their affairs done. Many Member States, regions and cities are still experiencing high unemployment rates and are not absorbing enough of the recovery in economic growth. And those performances in the EU differ so enormously. There are those that are barely developing, there are those that are making rapid progress with reforms. With a helping hand, with this program, member states can quickly give direction to growth and jobs. This support can be provided by means of various instruments, workshops, expanding ICT capacity and the exchange of expertise. I am pleased with the proposal now under way, a unique EU-wide instrument that will give all Member States the opportunity to accelerate the necessary changes in the European Semester. The support program is an impetus for real change and is thus also an example for the fiscal capacity in the euro area in the future. In the execution of the program we find a better balance between the carrot and the stick, so to speak. Not Member States alone punish them if they fail to achieve certain objectives in the Stability and Growth Pact, but also encourage them.Finally, I would like to express my thanks to the representatives of the Maltese Presidency, colleagues, the European Commission and the co-rapporteur of the Committee on Economic Affairs, Costas Mavrides.I also thank Constanze Krehl and all the other rapporteurs and shadow rapporteurs.Get started with this new instrument!", "language": "en", "original_language": "nl", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 192, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Derek VAUGHAN", "mepid": "96918", "text": "  deputising for the rapporteur. – Mr President, the more perceptive amongst us will realise that I am not Constanze Krehl. Unfortunately Ms Krehl cannot be here tonight – she sends her apologies and has asked me to speak on her behalf. I am sure that, if Ms Krehl was here, she would want to thank the co—rapporteur, Mr Van Nistelrooij, and all the shadows for their usual cooperation in this important report.  I want to start my contribution by making a general point about structural reforms. I think that too often structural reforms are seen as being only about privatisation, cuts and austerity, but they should not be. Structural reforms should be about positive things and about changing an economy in a positive way. It should be about changing an economy to promote jobs and growth, to promote research and development, and to promote education and training. All these things are important. Those are the type of structural reforms that I think we should be supporting.  That is why structural funds are so important when we talk about structural reforms: structural funds are an investment in all the things I have just mentioned. That is why, in the current programme of structural funds, we have ex-ante conditionalities: to make sure that structural funds are producing results and are achieving jobs and growth. We put in place conditionalities to make sure we promote policies on growth, the environment, gender equality and many other things. These are the type of things we can use structural funds for in order to improve growth across the European Union.  Today, we are talking about using technical assistance to support structural reforms in Member States. This will be on a voluntary basis. Member States can, if they wish, take advantage of this new policy and can, of course, add their own funds to it as well. We should not forget that some of the technical assistance will go towards important areas and important policies, such as education and training. However, we also should not forget that the Commission is proposing EUR 143 million to be redirected, mainly from structural funds, towards technical assistance. Therefore, my group believes it is important that the new reform programmes align with cohesion policy aims, because we are using cohesion policy funds. We also believe it is important that local and regional governments are involved in the reform process so that their needs are met – Mr van Nistelrooij mentioned this in his contribution as well. We also think it is important that Parliament receive the support plans and monitoring reports so that we, as a democratic body, can look at the progress which is being made.  We also believe that it is important, from a budget point of view, that this programme, which redirects structural funds, does not set a precedent for the future. Certainly, we in the S&amp;D Group could not accept the slicing of structural funds to be used for future new programmes and initiatives. If we want new programmes and new initiatives, then we have to find other ways of funding them. We have already seen a cut in the current structural funds programme, and if Brexit happens, the EU budget will be cut in the future as well. There will be less money for all programmes, including structural funds. So those of us who want to protect structural funds have to make this point now. They have to make the point very, very strongly that this cannot be a precedent for the future. We know that structural funds could also be under attack in the future from those who want to reduce the funding of structural funds or want to scrap structural funds altogether.  So I would say, in conclusion, that the S&amp;D Group supports this report. We have been the co—rapporteur, with Mr Van Nistelrooij, on the report. We support it, and we also support the proposal put forward by the Commission and will be voting for it tomorrow, but we would not want to see this as a precedent. The S&amp;D Group believes that structural funds have always been one of the most important policies of the European Union, and should be in the future. We will be fighting to defend them in the future.

It will allow for providing technical support to Member States, upon their request, for the implementation of reforms. These reforms – to modernise economies, strengthen competitiveness, encourage investment, generate jobs and raise living standards – are crucial for cohesion and upward convergence. Such reforms work. We have seen how the countries that embarked on an ambitious reform path, such as Ireland, Spain, the Baltic countries and Portugal, have been able to catch up remarkably ever since and return to growth and job creation. This means less poverty and less social exclusion. Yet, in general, the implementation of structural reforms is not satisfactory. Our assessment shows that Member States have made only between ‘limited’ and ‘some’ progress on last year’s Country-Specific Recommendations. The overall record since the inception of the European Semester in 2011 points to differences in the pace and depth of reforms. We all know that reforms demand political courage. They may impinge on powerful vested interests. Their technical complexity is often a barrier, while others may imply budgetary costs. Some countries face challenges in terms of institutional and administrative capacity. It is not enough to legislate, the reforms need to be implemented in a timely and efficient manner.  This is where the Structural Reform Support Programme can make a real difference. In 2016, technical support provided by the Commission’s Structural Reform Support Service was requested by six Member States: Bulgaria, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. We have been able to assist governments with their public finance management, implementation of administrative, judiciary and health-care reforms, development of capital markets and access to finance. In parallel, the Structural Reform Support Service has continued to coordinate comprehensive support for the Greek administration. For example, with the help of technical assistance, in February Greece started to roll out the Guaranteed Minimum Income scheme nationally. This represents a fundamental change of the social welfare system to provide protection to those who have been left outside any safety net. Based on feedback received and numerous expressions of interest, such support is clearly deemed useful, even necessary. But this support cannot and will not replace the role of the authorities, which remain responsible for the reforms, their design and successful implementation. I am happy that thanks to very constructive interinstitutional cooperation, we have succeeded rapidly in accommodating our concerns. I wish to thank the European Parliament, in particular the Committee on Regional Development (REGI) and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, and all other committees involved for their valuable contributions. I would also like to thank the co-rapporteurs, Mr Van Nistelrooij and Ms Krehl, for their dedicated work, and the REGI chair, Ms Mihaylova, for her constructive and open approach during the trilogues. Together with the outstanding work done by the Dutch, the Slovak and the Maltese Presidencies, we have an improved text that awaits your vote.  The key features of the Programme are as follows. It will have a budget of EUR 142.8 million for years 2017-2020. The scope of its actions is broad in order to enable to support whatever needs are pertinent in Member States. But at the same time, cohesion policy elements are clearly emphasised. The support is to be provided on the request of the Member State. It is to be tailor-made and adapted to the country-specific needs and effected in full cooperation with the government involved. We support the involvement of the social partners and civil society in the preparation and implementation of reforms. Their support is a key success factor. Such involvement should take place in accordance with the legal set-up of each Member State and in compliance with their institutional framework. While underlining the spirit of cooperation and partnership, the administrative procedures remain light, so as to enable delivery of support as swiftly as possible, but always in full respect of the Financial Regulation. We are fully committed to ensuring proper monitoring and evaluation. Transparency is crucial to all of us. Therefore, we will transmit to Parliament without delay the Cooperation and Support Plans agreed with the Member States, and in line with the conditions set out in the Regulation. We will also provide information on the Annual Work Programme, Annual Monitoring Report and independent interim and ex-post evaluation reports. I am confident that the Programme will be a positive instrument to make our economies more resilient. I also believe that the support provided under the new Programme would substantially contribute to the cohesion of the European regions, as strongly advocated by the European Parliament.

Thus, with the definition of national authority, we involve municipalities and regions in the European process, because municipalities and regions are the access points to the resources that the European Union makes available to citizens. And we take another successful step by making it even clearer what the mission of the structural programs is and what should always be. This mission is to make effective economic, social and territorial cohesion, and it is also to close gaps, build bridges and bring wills closer together.

The Commission is ready to activate the Structural Reform Support Programme (SRSP) as soon as it is adopted, and to proceed as swiftly as possible with the following steps: Member States must first submit their requests; the Commission will analyse those requests, ensuring equal treatment; the Commission will conclude the cooperation and support plans with Member States and then prepare the annual work programme, and only afterwards will it finalise all the contracting procedures. On the question which was raised concerning the imposition of unwanted reforms on the Member States, it is very clearly stated in the regulation that this is done at the request of the Member State and not the other way round.  The European Parliament will remain closely involved in the role of the SRSP, and I will be coming back to report on both the first steps and the first results under the programme. With the help of Parliament and the Council, we have an excellent text to seal, so let us continue to work in this spirit of partnership between the three institutions.

The Committee on Culture has had this topic since I have been there, since 2014, on the agenda, and even in one of the previous reports, which I also drafted, and at the suggestion of colleagues in the Committee on Culture, I introduced the need , we talked about the need to introduce this Year of Heritage 2018. And here, at a speed, very recently, the European Council opened this topic and we started to write this report in an emergency procedure. From that moment on, I must tell you, there has been an extraordinary solidarity throughout the Committee on Culture and Education. Not only the shadow rapporteurs, but everyone, I see many of them here in the room now, they are with me, they have been with me, especially in the most delicate point of the development of this subject, namely in the negotiations on which I had with the Commission and the Council. Indeed, they were really with me there, in all the delicate points of the negotiations, and what has been achieved is why I am very pleased today, I am very pleased with what has been achieved in these negotiations, and the cooperation with the European Commission and the Council. it was absolutely remarkable and I want to appreciate it not in the usual Oscar reflexes, but simply it was. That's right, which means that we have the premises, we have on the table the premises of an extremely interesting topic. One more thing to note: in the vote in the Committee on Culture, all the political groups supported this subject, with one exception, which I find really funny, tenderly funny, namely one of the political groups, which usually does this, he opposes everything, he told me that he has nothing against it, but for reasons politicians must vote against. I understand, which probably means that tomorrow's vote will be simple, easy and clear, especially once again that we can understand: culture unites, does not divide, even at this level. From this point of view, what I already love is the fact that, in 2018, we will have the opportunity, and it will happen, to show off, citizens, states, European institutions, associations, structures of all kinds in the field, to we display what we have best in our countries, what represents us as a national identity and the final conclusion of this year, I am very convinced that it will be so, is that the European element will appear in all these national events, which will prove that we are indeed a unitary space, built in many years, even in a thousand years, through a common history, some common experiences, some good, some not very good or unhappy. What is certain is that today we are a common space. This will surely be the conclusion of this Year of Heritage. One extremely important thing I notice, I want to point out, is the fact that it already happened yesterday, it started, even if the report has not yet been voted in the Commission. All European states were invited, they participated, the Commission was extremely prepared and thorough and this topic was practically started. Let's be on time and let's hope that tomorrow's vote won't stop this - let's say - flight!", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 225, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Tibor Navracsics", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, let me first thank you for your overwhelming support for the European Year of Cultural Heritage which, without the European Parliament, we would not have had this year. Special thanks go to the rapporteur Mr Mircea Diaconu, and to Ms Silvia Costa, for leading Parliament’s negotiating team. Tomorrow, with the vote on the decision to establish the year, we will take a big step towards bringing Europe’s heritage closer to citizens. The year is a perfect opportunity to put Europe’s cultural richness in the spotlight. I am confident that this initiative will help us lead an open dialogue on the shared values that connect us and make us stronger. What is especially important to me is that we use this unique opportunity to reach out to people from all backgrounds, way beyond those who are already interested in and familiar with cultural heritage. In particular, I want to reach out to young people. Cultural heritage is not just about the past. It has a vital role in building the future. Young people therefore have to be at the heart of the year. We will bring this initiative to life through real collaborative work at all levels, from the European, through national, regional and, crucially, local levels. At the national level, national coordinators designated by each Member State will lead the implementation. They had their first meeting just this week on Tuesday. The list of events and activities they are planning is impressive. I am pleased to say that the European Parliament sent two observers to this meeting so you are fully on board and will remain so throughout 2017 and 2018. I will make sure this is the case. We will also implement the year in close dialogue with key civil society organisations which will help us with the expertise and outreach. At the European level we will, for example, launch a specific call for proposals under the Creative Europe programme at the end of this year to fund transnational cooperation projects in the field of cultural heritage dedicated to the year’s objectives; devote resources to organising around 10 flagship initiatives at European level; develop synergies with existing Creative Europe initiatives devoted to cultural heritage, in particular the European Heritage Days, the EU Prize for Cultural Heritage, and the European Heritage label; join forces with other Commission departments which also fund cultural heritage, so that they support the year on top of its dedicated budget and run a communication campaign to give high visibility to our actions. I am particularly pleased that we will be able to give more attention to our flagship initiatives thanks to the extra resources. For example, a project with schools will bring children and young people into contact with cultural heritage, encouraging them to appreciate its relevance and fostering a sense of belonging to a common European space and together with UNESCO, we will promote the European sites awarded the UNESCO label of World Heritage. As actions on cultural heritage receive significant funding from several EU programmes, we estimate that at least a further EUR 100 million will be used to support the objectives of the year in addition to initiatives on budget. These funds will come from the Cohesion Funds, from Horizon 2020 for research projects on cultural heritage, and from other EU programmes supporting the environment, culture, tourism, citizenship and external relations. Honourable Members, the European Year of Cultural Heritage 2018 is a great opportunity to tap into the full potential of cultural heritage. One single year is, of course, not enough to achieve this aim, but it is a good start to pave the way for a long-lasting heritage policy that makes a difference for citizens and helps us build the Europe of the future.

Thank you very much for your cooperation, of course, the Commission and the Maltese Presidency. We fought in the interest of European citizens, so that through the knowledge and enhancement of cultural heritage - which, I remember, is intangible and digital - the reasons for common values ​​and the concrete possibility of creating bridges and not walls can be found. However, in order for the richness of European cultural diversity to become an opportunity for dialogue and peace, the involvement of the Member States, regions, municipalities and above all citizens, and especially young people in particular, as has been said, is indispensable in building a future of intercultural dialogue and peace. I believe that the opening of the House of European History on 4 May is also at the right time. Already yesterday, for the first time, as mentioned, the Parliament with two of its members participates in the coordination of the European Year together with the national coordinators of the Member States. A message is central to us, that is, the enhancement of the European and transversal dimension of cultural heritage, both through collaboration between the various directorates-general of the Commission and through governance between European institutions, Member States and stakeholders to promote crossborder projects alongside flag initiatives. the Commission and the Member States and the active participation of civil society. IS the result in terms of resources is also significant.We have doubled from 4 to 8 million, of which only half, fortunately, weigh on the budget of \"Creative Europe\", which this year however has grown, while the other 4 come from other budget chapters.I remember that other programs will participate with calls dedicated to this year.I close by saying that I also share the choice made by the Commission's DG Culture of four axes of activity: involvement, enhancement, protection and innovation.This will finally give a framework to what must finally become a true European policy for cultural heritage that goes beyond 2018.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 228, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Helga TRÜPEL", "mepid": "28240", "text": "on behalf of the Verts / ALE Group. - Mister President!

We are showing how great the diversity of cultural heritage is and that culture in Europe never only exists in the singular, but always in the plural. And that it is a great opportunity for many citizens to experience and learn that one has always benefited from cultural exchange and cultural dialogue in European history. There are people who are now questioning that and wanting back to culturally homogeneous societies. I think that's a serious mistake. Therefore, to make it clear how rich European cultural history is, that it is about intercultural dialogue and intercultural understanding, about showing that cultural exchange has brought people together and that they have a richer life as a result, that is the goal of this year of cultural Heritage.

This is why, a priori, I welcomed with great benevolence the desire of this Parliament to make 2018 the year of cultural heritage.

From my point of view, the initial 8 million euros or the 15 million requested by our rapporteur will not change anything if the objectives for this year remain as they are. Indeed, the current structure reminds me more of a vast marketing operation in favor of the European Union than of fully useful actions for the safeguard of cultural property in Europe.

The idea of ​​a year dedicated to the enhancement of European tangible and intangible cultural heritage was born two years ago with the report entitled \"Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe\", with which Parliament stressed the importance of European cultural heritage, both tangible and intangible, as a fundamental factor for the conservation of European culture and history and the safeguarding of values ​​linked to European identity. A Year for cultural heritage, therefore, as a shared resource that implies collective responsibility, a factor capable of strengthening the sense of common European belonging, especially in this delicate historical moment, in which too many citizens seem to have lost their sense, pride and the very reason for their being together in our common project. Enhancing the recognized sites that have obtained the European cultural heritage label must therefore become a political priority to support our European awareness, our sense of belonging to a common cultural space, to the European dimension, the result of an intertwined and centuries-old history, and reinforce the ideals and values ​​that led to European integration. Flagship initiatives linked to 2018 will therefore be organized, together with inclusive events, initiatives and awareness campaigns to convey the value of unity in the diversity of the richness of the European cultural heritage and bring its citizens closer to the Union.

As Commissioner Tibor Navracsics said, the link between culture and tourism is obvious and indestructible. So I do not want the Year of Cultural Heritage to be a simple image campaign, but I want to see it as an opportunity to highlight how the synergy between tourism and cultural heritage contributes to the promotion of everything that is more precious in Europe. At the same time, we must ensure that the European Year will be marked in all European states, and that the action plan will succeed in identifying and promoting the hidden treasures of our continent.

Europe's cultural heritage is a common resource and a good for all, which must be preserved for future generations and whose protection is a common responsibility of all. Created, over time, through the synthesis of the extremely diverse cultural expressions of the civilizations that inhabited Europe, the inherited cultural heritage can play an important role in the cohesion of communities at a time when European societies are going through a period of increasing diversity. The European Year will encourage a better understanding of the need to protect and promote the diversity of cultural expressions. Understanding the vital importance of cultural heritage for our community, UDMR launched five years ago the program \"Heritage protectors - adopt a monument\" which aims to educate and involve young people in protecting and promoting the built heritage. The program was a real success, during this period, more and more students and high school students understood the importance of protecting the monuments, training enthusiasts in activities dedicated to this purpose.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen in the Court of Auditors! As every year, Parliament not only has to decide on the budget, but also to vote on the discharge of the Commission and the other European institutions for the past financial years in order to give them discharge. This year we are voting on the discharge for the 2015 financial year. In doing so, we have come to the end of a journey of several months that began with the submission of the annual report of the Court of Auditors for the 2015 financial year and the submission of the annual reports of the directorates-general for the same year - that is now more than seven months ago. This report would not have been possible without close cooperation with the relevant institutions and individuals. I would therefore particularly like to thank the representatives of the Court of Auditors, namely the President Klaus Heiner-Lehne and the responsible auditor, Mr Lazaros Lazarou, and their staff. I would like to thank Commissioner Kristalina Georgieva and, after the change in office, Commissioner Günther Oettinger, as well as all Commissioners and Directors General and their staff for many constructive and open discussions. A special thank you from me personally goes to the staff of the committee secretariat, Mr Godts and Ehlers, Mr Szechy as advisor to my group and my colleague Mr Reichel. Of course, I would also like to thank all my colleagues who worked as shadow rapporteurs on the drafting of the report, and all colleagues from Parliament who added more than 400 amendments to the report. To anticipate it right away: The Committee on Budgetary Control is recommending, following the recommendation of the Court of Auditors, to grant discharge to Parliament and the Commission for 2015. In the accompanying Resolution criticizes the deficits in the management and in the audit of the expenditure of EU funds, names the Member States with the worst results and gives concrete recommendations for measures to remedy the problems. The resolution welcomes the approach of a stronger focus on results, that is to say, in addition to checking the legality and regularity of payments, there is also more research into whether the results of projects and programs meet the original objectives. The whole thing runs under the heading “performance-based budgeting”. Unfortunately, it is not the time here to review the 137 pages that the resolution now comprises and to go into the details that are raised there. I hope that will happen in a follow-up to the report so that it doesn't just disappear in the filing cabinet. I would like to emphasize a few things: We ask for a better coordination of the previous planning cycles. We have faced the seven-year medium-term financial framework with a five-year mandate from the European Parliament and the Commission. The whole thing is then backed up with a strategic ten-year planning cycle, and the budget must not only do justice to the EU 2020 strategy or the Commission's top ten priorities, but also - and increasingly - react to current political and financial crises . In 2020 there is an opportunity to bring these long-term strategies into harmony with the budget cycle - otherwise Parliament and the Commission - otherwise tie them more closely to political goals and financing that they could not decide on in advance, and thus make the budget more flexible he can react better to current challenges.

There is no doubt that the EDF represents one of the largest official development assistance budgets in the world. But given the immensity of the challenges facing Africa, it will soon prove - I fear - insufficient. These challenges, you know them, are poverty, health emergencies, climate emergencies or even population growth. As for demography, allow me to draw your attention to a few figures: in 2100, the population of the African continent will be around 4.5 billion on a planet of 11 billion inhabitants, that is to say say that one in three Terrans will be African. By 2100, Nigeria's population will approach 900 million, roughly equivalent to all people living on the African continent today. Faced with this reality, it is little to say that we will be overwhelmed very quickly. Coming back to the EDF discharge, we have come to the end of a long procedure, and I would of course like to thank all of my colleagues, the European Court of Auditors and the European Commission for their assistance. All the discussions that we have had made it possible to identify certain difficulties and certain blockages - which unfortunately are not new, which we repeat every year and for which the European Parliament demands additional efforts from the Commission. We ask it in particular to reduce the levels of errors which are still too high and to tackle the most frequent errors, to take more account of key information to limit the error rate and, of course, to strengthen ex ante controls. . However, we also congratulate the Commission on the many improvements that we have seen, in particular with regard to the reduction old pre-financing, outstanding commitments and contracts that have expired. We also ask the Commission to provide the European Parliament with more information on certain expenses, in particular those which are the subject of reservations made by the Commission itself, and in particular for the African Peace Facility, for which we are waiting now concrete, immediate and effective responses. We are also making proposals to improve the performance and efficiency of the EDF. I will not go into detail, but it concerns the types, causes, blockages, and also to provide for the suspension of a project when it is classified as red. Then, for us, there is also the problem of the outsourcing of a number of missions, in particular through Trust Funds and international organizations.

The information provided was helpful and I got a better idea of ​​the organization and the dedication of many. I also recommend that tomorrow we grant discharge to the President of Parliament. At the same time, I noticed that there are subjects that are sensitive. I saw it as my duty as a rapporteur not to take any notice of taboos or sensitivities. After the vote in the Committee on Budgetary Control, a number of sharp edges were removed from the report, but I would like to thank my colleagues that the core has remained intact on almost all subjects. My search began with the way in which the European Court of Auditors audits Parliament's budget expenditure. In my opinion, there is too much the idea that most of the expenditure relates to personnel costs and that not so much can go wrong. Therefore, only 16 transactions were examined. In discussions with the Court of Audit, we found that the checks could be a bit more extensive due to the possible damage to the image. Take the House of European History. The opening has been postponed several times, but next week it will happen and the media has immediately started a discussion whether this should be paid from tax money. In addition, running a museum is a core task of Parliament. And how do you decide on the exhibitions without political bias? In the report we recommend that this museum be at least remote and it would also be fine if the Brussels local authorities were more directly involved in this project. More generally, I noticed frustration at Parliament's Communication Service. Skepticism about the European Union and about Parliament is growing all over Europe. Fewer and fewer people are participating in European elections. Go there, if information service, just turn it on. I think the only solution is to send less and receive more. But that is not an easy task, because many critical citizens have already turned away from politics as a whole. I propose that the Communication department starts working with concrete benchmarks to measure its results. Even more sensitive is the expenditure of the European political parties and foundations of political groups. Parliament provides subsidies, but justification for expenditure is poor. In addition, the media was full of reports of misuse by some especially newly formed parties and foundations. More manpower really needs to be put into this than the two FTEs that Parliament has allocated for this. There is also work for Parliament's internal auditor and, of course, for the newly established authority. Another sensitive point is the voluntary pension fund. I originally heard from the Secretary General that there were no immediate problems. But there is indeed an actuarial deficit of 276 million euros. In a few years, the taxpayer may start coughing up this bit by bit. I find this unacceptable, which is why I am calling on the Secretary-General to come up with a comprehensive action plan in order not to let it get that far. Then there is the general expense allowance. For some colleagues it is in principle not negotiable to be accountable for this. I do not understand that. This is not a salary, but intended for specific expenses. This amounts to more than 50,000 euros per Member of the European Parliament per year. Now let us agree once and for all that we will be accountable for this and that the results can be presented on the personal webpages of MEPs on Parliament's site. There are dozens of other recommendations in the report.

The Council once excelled in its absence and your presence, Mr Borg, is a very good thing because you will hear comments during the debate, you will hear calls that might lead to better financial management, but for which we also need the Member States. I hope you will pass on the messages we are conveying today to the Council itself. I am rapporteur for the Committee of the Regions, for the discharge of the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee and the European Data Protector, as well as for the discharge for the Council itself. As far as the Council is concerned, I actually recommend postponing the discharge and that for the umpteenth time, the seventh time in a row. Postpone until October, and then we can use the period May-October to try to resolve the long-standing conflict between the Council and Parliament. In the Committee on Budgetary Control, Mrs Grässle, our chairman, and I have had a very constructive conversation with the Secretary-General of the Council. We have also set up a group in the Committee on Budgetary Control to examine this issue. In fact, we intend to come up with a text that can then be submitted to Coreper where we hope that the conflict over which access we can have, which documents we can have access to, what information will be provided to us to ensure a proper discharge to the Council to resolve that conflict and then hopefully see to it that this long-standing conflict is swept out the door. I do propose that the three other reports be granted discharge. In all those reports I used the same methodology, asked the same questions. Do we get our money's worth? Are results-oriented budgeting being done within those institutions? What about those settings with transparency? What about the anti-corruption policy? How do those institutions deal with their staff? Is there a good working atmosphere there? What about the male-female ratio in the middle and top positions? Those kinds of questions have been asked. I have also visited those three institutions. I have spoken to the leading figures in those three institutions. They were very constructive conversations and I learned a lot from them. The approach differs from institution to institution, hence the recommendation in my three reports that differ from institution to institution. But we can effectively grant discharge. I would also like to say very explicitly that I really appreciate the work of the Court of Auditors, Mr Lehne. What you are doing is fantastic. We can really get started with your work and from your work we have learned for the umpteenth year in a row that the margin of error of the Commission budget is on average 3.8%. We all know that that is actually still too much. We also all know that this is not necessarily fraud. It certainly is not. But it is money that should not have been paid out or in a different way. In fact, the Court of Auditors has been saying for many years that the Member States, Mr Borg, knew or should have known that some expenditure, that some subsidies, should not have been paid. So there is an important responsibility with those Member States. I call on you to enter into a discussion about this within the Council, to enter into a debate in order to sharpen the responsibility of those finance ministers within the Member States. More alertness is needed. Greater responsibility is needed on the part of Member States. I would like to thank Mr Zeller for taking up the recommendation in his report and also the warning that the share of climate-related expenditure in the European budget is far too low. It now averages 17.6%. If that's not fixed - there we are in the Commission budget control agree - then we will not reach the target of 20%. Then we will not be able to realize the efforts that are necessary and that we have made internationally in the context of the Paris Convention, the climate treaty. I also ask, together with Mr Zeller, for special attention to the whole problem of shadow budgets. There are many financial mechanisms that are used to support Union policy, but which are kept completely outside the European budget. It is very difficult to control and that can lead to a lack of responsibility. This can cause inconsistency in policy and can lead to unnecessary risk taking. There is therefore clearly a need for greater transparency and I am very grateful to Mr Oettinger for his commitment as Commissioner to reintroduce those various shadow budgets back into the Union budget in the long term. I think that's a good thing. As far as the Parliament budget is concerned, I agree fully with what Mr De Jong has just said, especially with regard to the attention paid to the fraudulent practices of European political parties and political foundations - usually very recent phenomena indeed. There is tampering there. We have established that a number of journalists have raised these fraudulent practices within a few weeks. We need to strengthen control within the European Parliament.

We had very successful cooperation and sometimes we had long discussions on several issues but, in the end, I believe we were able to find good compromises and good explanations for the questions raised. During the procedure, in addition to examining whether expenditure by the institutions was in line with European regulations, we also concentrated on some specific issues, including transparency, openness of the institutions, access to information, public access to documents in the institutions, and also the whistleblower protection rules of the institutions. The second issue we concentrated on was how aligned spending is with the principle of performance-based budgeting, which was already mentioned beforehand. It is not only compliance with the rules, but also whether the outcome of expenditure is efficient and effective. We believe that the institutions are performing better and better regarding this. We also tried to have a look at the gender balance in the institutions and anti-harassment protection. Finally, we believe that it is important to check the EMAS performance of the institutions and, as my colleague Bart Staes already mentioned, how the funds are used for CO2 offsetting and the fight against climate change. Regarding specific institutions, starting with the European External Action Service, I think the most important issue here is to make the distinction between economic diplomacy and simple economic lobbying, and how to provide transparency for the latter. We do not have the answers yet but we had very constructive discussions with Vice-President Mogherini in this sense. Some questions were also raised regarding some building buying by the EEAS in some countries. I believe that finally we have some answers. Not everything was clarified but I hope that, since I regard the discharge procedure as a long procedure, in the long run we can set up a transparent and accountable system for the control of this issue as well. Regarding the European Court of Justice, I have to mention that at the very beginning there were some misunderstandings or conflicts between the Court of Auditors and the Court of Justice as to how the Court of Auditors obtain access to some information within the Court of Justice. I am happy that finally – and I hope that we contributed to this procedure – we could find a compromise and the Court of Auditors and the Court of Justice agreed on how to settle this problem. I agree with Mr Staes that the Court of Auditors is an extremely important institution for the Budgetary Control Committee (CONT). We have very good cooperation and I would like to emphasise the high level of cooperation and the constructive discussions with the Court of Auditors. Finally, regarding the agencies, we Greens continued with the push for greater independence and transparency in the work of the EU agencies and have strongly opposed conflicts of interest of the agencies’ management or external associates to limit the influence of the lobbyists and the corporate sector.

Yes, I too would like to welcome, first of all, Commissioner Oettinger, which will be his first discharge procedure, and I would like to thank the President of the Court of Auditors, Mr Lehne, in particular for his presence. Also to Mr Lazarou, the - let us say - guardian of the DAS, and also, of course, to Mr Borg, of the Maltese Presidency. First of all, it is not new to highlight the significant influence that European agencies have both in the formulation of policies and in decision-making and in the implementation of programs. And that, more and more. They are important for issues as important to citizens and institutions as health, the environment, human and social rights, migration and refugees, innovation, financial oversight, security and protection. So much diversity and, at the same time, so much responsibility. And, in fact, due to this impact on daily life, it is also possible to demand their autonomy and independence, precisely to protect their criteria and the credibility of all of them. All of them receive funding of a different kind, since there are many - more than thirty, hence their diversity. We have seen that in this last year there has been a slight increase --or a more important increase, depending on the point of view-, but that this increase, and, above all, in terms of its employees, is reflected, above all, in the agencies that deal with migration and the prevention of serious crimes and terrorism, which were especially priorities of the Union in 2015. And we also find that, according to the summary provided by the Court of all its audits, all of them have happened without any reservation, except in the case of Frontex and in the case of the European Institute of Innovation and Technology, but that afterwards, in fruitful dialogue with the Court of Auditors, the Commission and the agencies, we have been able to resolve all doubts and the problems, so that at this moment we may be in a position to clearly propose the discharge of all of them. I believe that in this dialogue the fundamental role of the network of agencies must be highlighted, which was created as an autonomous element and which is increasingly being reinforced. We would have right now ―at this moment, I think it is a legitimate demand― to reinforce its personnel, since precisely the activity of this coordination ―a coordination, furthermore, accredited and reinforced― of the agencies has also generated very good results and some products and instruments of bilateral and network cooperation that have made our work much easier and solved many of the problems. Also, there are some issues that need to be improved, of course. And there is my demand, also, both to Commissioner Oettinger and to Mr Lehne, regarding the solution that we should give to the continuous extensions of commitment appropriations that are taking place, which even in 2015 have increased somewhat, and that more and more, and I believe that, with the help of the Court of Auditors - Mr Lehne says yes, and I thank him very much - we could reach a solution, so that they do not all appear the same, but those that are planned, in an easier way, and those that are not, then yes, absolutely, audit. On the other hand, we also run into the problem of audits. Mr Lehne, I am ready to reinforce the resources of the Court of Auditors as much as necessary so that these audits remain public and the Court of Auditors continues to guarantee them. I think that would be progress. We also have some issues in relation to the renewed or double downsizing of staff - 5% + 5% - which could undermine the need for agencies to get to the bottom in their mandates and in their actions, so we are rather cautious there. . And we have also carried out a first indication in relation to the impact of Brexit in some of the agencies that are precisely in the United Kingdom and that we need to be able to clarify.And, finally, there is a group proposal - I thank my colleagues who have supported me for the moment - that I would like us to be able to develop in a more successful way in the future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 258, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Miroslav POCHE", "mepid": "124699", "text": "rapporteur. - Mr President, the European Union's Joint Undertakings make a very important contribution to the development of European research and also to its practical application. The share of European Union investment in joint ventures is not negligible: in 2015, companies had a budget of over € 1.3 billion. Last year, this plenary decided to postpone three reports in the first round, namely for ITER, ENIAC and ARTEMIS: I note that ARTEMIS and ENIAC have merged into ECSEL, so that this year only ECSEL is part of the budget discharge. All the postponed budget discharge was subsequently adopted at the September plenary session. I am glad that, unlike last year, this year, in my role as rapporteur, I do not have to propose postponing these discharge for a single joint venture. My position was also confirmed by a majority of the members of the Committee on Budgetary Control. The Council of the European Union also recommended in February that discharge be granted to all Joint Undertakings. The European Court of Auditors, as well as the Committee on Budgetary Control later, noted significant improvements, especially in the areas highlighted by the two institutions in the past in the 2015 discharge process. Horizon 2020 funding was launched in 2015. We cannot disguise that the start-up of projects takes longer than we would like, but in this respect the joint ventures face major challenges. On the other hand, and I do not want to downplay what has just been said, delays are often caused by high demands on the quality of projects. In any case, the 2015 audit reports present separately the results related to FP7 and Horizon 2020, as requested by the European Parliament in the past. Last year, the European Parliament mentioned a number of horizontal comments on the European Court of Auditors and the structure of its reports. It is clear that the European Court of Auditors has tried to incorporate and take our comments into account. I very much appreciate the quality of the European Court of Auditors' reports for the year 2015, as well as very effective cooperation with individual joint ventures during the preparation of reports. As I mentioned, the situation of all the Joint Undertakings has significantly improved and been remedied in a number of areas which have been highlighted by both the European Court of Auditors and the European Parliament in the past. We have probably seen the biggest shift in the Fusion for Energy Joint Undertaking, which represents the European Union in the ITER project. I do not hide the fact that ITER is still the biggest challenge among all the Joint Undertakings, and I will look at it in much more detail in a moment. This year, for the first time, we are deciding on the granting of budget discharge for the new Joint Undertaking for the Biotechnology Industry, BBI. Despite the fact that it operated independently only since October 2015, this company did not experience any major problems in its accounting, nor with its organizational or personnel structure. As last year, this year the ECSEL Joint Undertaking received a qualified opinion. This was only for a reason related to the unfortunate setting of the legislative framework of the Seventh Framework Program, ie the inability of the Court to audit national certification bodies. We drew attention to this in our debates last year and made it clear that the systemic problem is in the Horizon 2020 regulation and that it has been eliminated during this time. In principle, the European Court of Auditors has no choice but to have, until the closure of the financial operations relating to ARTEMIS and ENIAC, to issue a qualified opinion, as this follows from the European Court of Auditors' regulation. This year, ECSEL also secured certificates from all national financial authorities regarding audits of ex-post payments. I would like to remind you that, based on the presentation of these certificates, we have decided to grant this budget discharge this year. In the accounting for 2015, for the first time we encounter in most companies the accounting of two types of in-kind costs, the so-called IKOP, ie standard in-kind costs as we know them, and the so-called IKAA, which are the costs of additional private activities. which are not financed by the budget of the European Union but contribute to the same objectives. There are methodologies for calculating the costs of additional activities, but these vary greatly from sector to sector. The calculation depends on the assessment of external auditors. The European Court of Auditors has no control competence over the costs of these activities, and this raises further problems. I believe that the calculations of additional costs will need to be given much more attention next year. I would also like to point out that joint ventures calculate the in-kind costs of IKOP, ie the costs of operational activities, on the basis of estimates. Experience shows that there is a common problem with billing by partners by the required deadline of 31 January of the following year. However, this problem cannot be solved at the level of the Joint Undertakings, as it depends on the deadline of the Member States' accounts. This is largely a formal problem rather than a risk to European investment, but it is certainly a problem. Finally, a brief look at Fusion for Energy, whose funding is, of course, in the spotlight. Neither the European Court of Justice nor the European Parliament, as the guardian of the budget, can ignore the fact of rising costs for this completely unique project. On the other hand, it is quite clear that a new course was set in 2015 and by then došlo (The President cut him off.)", "language": "en", "original_language": "cs", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 259, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Ian Borg", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, Commissioner Oettinger, President Lehne, it is a pleasure for us to be here, and thank you for your comments of appreciation.

On 28 February 2017, my colleague Minister Scicluna had the honour of presenting the Council’s recommendation to grant discharge to the Commission, to the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I believe tomorrow you will confirm the vote of the Committee on Budgetary Control and grant discharge to the Commission. I am glad that the European Parliament and the Council are able to agree on this important issue. In its recommendation, the Council outlined a number of elements which, from our point of view, should be followed up and implemented by all actors and without delay. All those involved in the management of EU funds need to assume their responsibilities in full, and yes, that includes the Member States.  The Council urged the Commission, and the Member States as well, to strengthen their mutual cooperation and stressed also the importance of avoiding errors in the first place. It also called on Member States to continue cooperating with the Commission and to give priority to increasing the quality of first-level checks in order to prevent or detect errors and correct them prior to declaring expenditure to the Commission. Yes, we must take into considerations that controls entail also a cost. Therefore a balance has to be found between the risk of error and the cost of control and audit, thereby focusing on better controls rather than on more controls.  On the one hand, prevention is always better than correction. Hence preventive measures by the Commission, such as interruption and suspension of payments, should be strictly applied. On the other hand, there is also a need to continue applying financial corrections and recoveries rigorously to protect the EU budget. In this context, the Council regrets that not all actors involved made full use of the available information to prevent, detect and also correct a significant proportion of those errors. This could have substantially reduced the estimated level of error across all chapters of expenditure. Nevertheless, we must also recognise the efforts made and actions already taken by the Commission and also by the Member States. The Council notes with satisfaction that the Court of Auditors finding that non-compliance with public procurement rules decreased, compared with the preceding years. This is also a reflection of the efforts made by the Commission, as well as the Member States, to address weaknesses in this area.  I would also like to point out that the Council considers the simplification of rules to be crucially important in order to achieve a lower level of error. In this regard, the Council also calls on the Commission to identify weaknesses in control systems, to analyse their costs and the benefits of possible corrective measures, to take or propose appropriate actions, such as simplification of the applicable provisions, improvement of the control systems, and also to redesign the relevant programmes. In this discharge procedure, the Council did not only look at the past, but it also looked to the future. It called on the Commission to prepare and publish, on an annual basis, a long-term and transparent forecast covering budgetary ceilings, estimated payment obligations and needs until the end of the current MFF, as well as capacity constraints and potential decommitments. Moreover, the Council also called on the Commission to provide on a regular basis clear, exhaustive and timely information about the needs for the payment appropriations and the availability of the funds in the annual budget.  Achieving results and focusing on performance is of paramount importance, especially in a context of budget discipline and scarce resources. The Council invited the Commission to continue its efforts in providing consistent and coherent measurements of performance at all the levels of management of the programmes in order to enable their meaningful assessment against the objectives set.  Finally, I would also like to say also a few words on the work done by the European Court of Auditors, which is highly appreciated by the Council. We also welcome the Court’s analysis of the errors and of the classification and distribution of corrective measures implemented in the very same year, 2015. We appreciate the Court’s work in assessing the results achieved by the EU budget, and we also consider it an important additional element of the annual evaluation of the sound financial management of EU funds. We therefore encourage the Court to continue increasing the focus on performance in its future annual reports.  It is obvious that we are still far from the overall aim of an unqualified audit opinion from the Court. The Council therefore reiterates its wish to see year-on-year improvements in the financial management systems, and also in the estimated level of errors across all policy areas. It should also be clear that the level of error estimated by the Court – and this was also highlighted by previous speakers – is not a result of fraud, inefficiency or waste of funds per se and the pressure on the European Union and the national finances is still a reality in the current economic scenario. This will require a more careful management of EU funds from all the institutions and stakeholders, as well as better forecasting of long-term funding requirements. I therefore conclude by emphasising that EU money should be used to achieve results that could not be achieved as efficiently or effectively by other means. We have to send a clear signal to the European citizens, to our taxpayers, that the EU funds are being used in a responsible and accountable manner.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 260, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. - (DE) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the rapporteurs, representatives of the Council Presidency, Mr President Lehne, ladies and gentlemen of the Court of Auditors, ladies and gentlemen! Budget policy is a continuous process - from the first draft, through the deliberation and approval of the budget, the budget implementation, the cash and accounting clearance to the auditing and control by various democratically legitimized bodies - Parliament, Council and Court of Auditors - to discharge, which is the focus today. I would like to thank you for the very factual, transparent and constructive discussion that I was able to witness in the past few weeks in the bodies of the Council and Parliament. I believe that this budgetary control can convince the citizens that our parliamentary democracy deserves trust and that the result of an economical and largely efficient use of budget funds also has a confidence-building effect. In the discharge report for the 2015 financial year, essential recommendations are made and suggestions for improvement are made. I promise you: We have to learn permanently - primarily we as the Commission, who propose budget priorities and who are essentially responsible for budget implementation. We are currently executing the 2017 budget, preparing the 2018 budget, and your recommendations and the discharge report will usefully be incorporated into the execution and preparation for next year. Six thoughts that I would like to raise here for the Commission. On the one hand: we want to continue doing everything we can with budget figures and programs to implement the European Union's priorities, to keep an eye on the Europe 2020 strategy and to unite for the labor market, infrastructure, quality of life, security and competitiveness of the European Union through budgetary policy to make an important contribution. In your report, you propose that the question be critically examined for seven years / five years. I am expressly ready to do so. Especially in uncertain times - in times when Brexit will trigger a period of transformation - five — plus — five instead of seven years could be a sensible consideration as to how we can move forward into the next decade. I will come back to this with you on the multiannual financial framework over the coming months. The issue of shadow households was mentioned. I take that seriously, because the subject of ancillary budget, shadow budget in addition to the main budget, can affect, endanger, and complicate the royal right of a parliament, including the council. I want to differentiate: On the one hand, shadow households always have the smell of indirect new debt. As a rule, this is not associated with this. I know from national and regional secondary budgets to achieve the goal of indirectly describing debt limits - this has practically nothing to do with it at European level. Secondly, it is important that we, of course, have an interest - we as the Commission and you - that the Community method is at the fore in budgetary policy. That is why we are also considering which secondary budgets can be integrated in the next MFF. You know that we have at least announced this consideration for the development aid fund. On the other hand, I tell you quite frankly: If there is a cap, 1% of the gross national income, in the interests of our citizens in order to carry out our tasks, I would prefer that I have money in secondary households than pure emptiness and no money. That is why the question of how strongly ancillary budgets can be integrated depends heavily on the question of how the Council and Parliament see the overall dimension of the budget in the next decade. In addition to what can be integrated into the main budget based on contract law, there are tasks and Instruments - I mention the EFSF, the ESM and others - which could not be linked to the European budget purely under contract law, which must therefore automatically be in the interests of stabilizing the euro area and in the interests of other tasks without changing the treaty, ancillary budgets and ancillary instruments. We then have to answer the question of which financing instruments are the best. I tell you specifically: for me, cohesion funds, budget programs and cash are still the norm. And the financial instruments like the Juncker Plan are useful and necessary additions, but they cannot replace budgetary resources. We will come back to this question with the next financial framework and with the extension of the Juncker plan and its further development. I want to expressly commit to the goal of a results-oriented EU budget - EU budget focused on results. And here we will continue to examine the question of how one can get closer to the definition of the target - what do we want to achieve with budget programs and how do we measure target achievement or failure to meet targets - with future budgets and with comments on budget figures. I believe that meaningful cooperation with Parliament and the European Court of Auditors can help each other here too. We want the best possible, better, optimal control and not more controls. Another goal to avoid duplication is to achieve a single exam, but that does well with high authority for all those in charge. I promise you that in a few months' time the Commission will implement and evaluate the measures you have proposed and report back to you in view of your discharge report, which you will adopt tomorrow. As I said, budget policy is a permanent event, a round-the-clock event. Therefore, I think today is a good intermediate step, a constructive communication from Parliament.Many thanks to all rapporteurs and the technical committee for an excellent contribution.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 261, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Klaus-Heiner LEHNE", "mepid": "2224", "text": "President of the Court of Auditors. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, Minister and President-in-Office of the Council! Thank you for inviting me to take part in the final debate on the discharge procedure for the 2015 financial year. It is a very special honor for me, not only because I can be here again today for the second time since I left this House to speak to colleagues, but also because I believe that it is an honor for the Court of Auditors is to do so and that we are very happy to contribute to this debate here. The discharge procedure is a good opportunity to look back and see what we can do better in the future. The rapporteurs have already mentioned this on many points in their introductory speeches. When I stood in front of you in October, I said that our most important task at the moment is to regain and strengthen the citizens' trust in the European Union project. In principle, nothing has changed about that. What is important here is that citizens must be able to see that the European Union is acting in a trustworthy and transparent manner when it deals with taxpayers' money, that it does so carefully, that it has clear objectives, that the funds are used efficiently and that it is achieving the results it promised will. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Zeller, and his colleagues and the CONT committee, chaired by Mrs Gräßle, on their reports. The discharge resolutions that have been tabled contain important points that support our recommendations as the Court of Auditors and our conclusions. We of course welcome that very much. The Court of Auditors is working hard to help ensure that budget is spent efficiently which is also reflected in our recently published opinions on the financial regulation or the mid-term review of the MFF. Our work shows how important it is to be able to rely on reliable management, monitoring and control systems that are observed by all parties involved: the Commission, the Member States and the external auditors. I would like to expressly agree with what Minister Borg and also the Commissioner said, namely that, when improving controls, we should focus above all on improving the quality and less on the quantitative side of controls. Indeed, it is crucial that we carry out qualitatively effective and efficient controls. In our 2016 annual report, which is not the subject of discussion today, but which is currently in progress and should be published in September, we will take up these points again and make special reference to them. At this point I would like to briefly address a few current priorities for our institution. Our annual report is continuously improved in terms of quality. We will concentrate more - this has already been mentioned - on performance aspects, simply because performance is just as important as compliance and it is precisely - let me put it another way - for the citizen whether what is actually happening is of decisive importance , also really happens correctly and efficiently. In addition, we will of course also try to improve our communication. This includes further developing the close cooperation with Parliament and continuing it at all levels. This applies in particular to cooperation with the Committee on Budgetary Control, of course, but also to cooperation with the other committees here in this House and with the Conference of Committee Chairs. We have been developing ours this year Work program streamlined so that we are able to better reflect the priorities of the various committees of the European Parliament. This year we received a total of 59 proposals from the Conference of Committee Chairs, most of them from budgetary control, of course, with suggestions as to what we should do. We will be deliberating and considering this very, very carefully, and I think that, as in the past, we will end up adopting a work program in which the majority of the proposals that we are going to deal with are from here on out come to the center of parliament. Europe is at a crossroads today. Strong centrifugal forces are pulling our Union from inside and outside and endanger the process of European integration. The idea of ​​Europe must be defended on many fronts. However, the solution cannot just be to deal with one crisis at a time. Fundamental reforms are just as important. Hence my request: let us use the coming spending cycle, as well as the negotiations on the withdrawal of a Member State, as an opportunity to improve the way we collect, spend and manage public money. This is also stated in the resolutions and in the statements, e.g. B. the Commissioner, has already been mentioned. In this context, I also welcome the way in which the role of the Court of Auditors was addressed in two recent decisions by the European Parliament - on institutional adjustments of February 16 and on Brexit of April 10. I can promise that, as the Court of Auditors, we will continue to make our contribution to Europe's success.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 262, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "on behalf of the S & amp; D group. - Mr Wieland, let me emphasize this moment, how we manage to simply cooperate.

We can of course also see that the Court of Auditors has carried out a good audit here. We can be proud of that because there is room for improvement here. Now we are turning to the European Fund for Sustainable Development, which is only a guarantee, quasi a guarantee. For me, one thing is always clear: if you vouch, then you pay. Some of our colleagues believe that in this area too it is money that you can simply spend and that does not have to come back.

I would like to add a few considerations on behalf of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe. Already as the rapporteur of the main report on the European Commission's discharge for 2014, last year I sought to see the discharge as an effective part of the life cycle of the management of European citizens' funds. That is why I am glad that the discharge becomes a logical and objective document, not a tool for slandering randomly selected culprits. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Zeller, very much for continuing this journey. We must not only look for, describe and correct mistakes, but above all we need to learn from them, identify the cause of failure and find a long-term solution, ideally of a preventive nature. However, the issue of error can never have one universal solution for all member states. I therefore consider it important that we learn from each other, look for examples of good practice and not waste time laboriously looking for existing solutions. Our view on results and performance should be the same, and thank you for mentioning that, Commissioner. The Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe will never compromise on the proper control and audit of projects, on sound financial management, on transparency, on objectivity or on the responsibility of those who manage European funds. But on the other hand, we want to see the concrete results, the added value and the tangible benefits of every euro invested. Our primary interest is the implementation of meaningful projects with high added value increasing the living standards of the citizens of the European Union. All scarce resources, and this is doubly true for financial ones, must be allocated efficiently and economically so as to guarantee the highest possible added value from the provider's point of view and from the recipient's point of view.

Thanks to the successful work, we were able to uncover many errors and many inaccuracies in the final accounts procedure.

This shows that the work of the European institutions has been responsible for the responsible use of European taxpayers' money.

The People's Party is clearly in favor of calling the mistakes made, in accordance with the majority opinion of the Committee on Budgetary Control, even if the former President of the European Parliament is responsible for these mistakes.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 268, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Jens GEIER", "mepid": "96833", "text": "- Mr President, Commissioner Oettinger, Minister, dear ex-colleague Lehne, Mr President of the Court of Auditors, dear colleagues! With my contribution - I can agree with Mr Deutsch - I would like to concentrate on the discharge of the European Parliament and talk about the sections that deal with the conduct of the former President of this House, Martin Schulz. What the Committee on Budgetary Control has decided here is, in my opinion, substantially wrong, excessive in its descriptions, redundant in content, goes far beyond the mandate of the Committee on Budgetary Control and thus actually constitutes a violation of the House's rules of procedure, which describe the tasks of the Committee on Budgetary Control: This does not include election campaigns. Why campaign? Because the task of the discharge report should be to deal with the housekeeping of the house and not to settle the accounts with functionaries about whom one has been annoyed. But the chairwoman of the Budgetary Control Committee, the German CDU member Ingeborg Gräßle, and her colleagues never tire of attacking Martin Schulz with strong words, who is now known to be the candidate for chancellor of my party, the SPD. Any decision criticized by the Committee on Budgetary Control has been classified as compliant by the administration of this House. A process not - but then it was not implemented. So, there is no violation of the rules - the Committee on Budgetary Control claims the opposite. That is dishonest and a political maneuver to gain advantages in the German federal election campaign. For example, where is a verifiable error? In the much discussed long-term business trips. The administration has just announced in the past that it will only discontinue continuous business trips for the EP office in Washington. This dissolves an allegation in thin air. But in order to be able to maintain the allegations, it is then cited incorrectly and interpreted incorrectly. At least that's sloppy, but actually manipulative. In the absence of any breach of the rules, OLAF, the European Union's Anti-Fraud Office, also announced today that it will not initiate an investigation. There is no such thing as a Schulz case. But I would like to draw your attention to a connection which, in my opinion, still plays too little role in the deliberations and in the reports on the unjustified allegations. If it is the case that the administration has established the legality of the behavior of the former speaker of parliament, what does that actually say about the parliament administration - the administration which, as secretary general, is headed by the German Christian Democrat Klaus Welle and who is also with us this evening? Because either the administration is right after all, then the allegations against Martin Schulz are unfounded, or the Budgetary Control Committee is right, then the Secretary General must also be made responsible for the behavior of his administration, because it would have covered and implemented alleged misconduct by the President. In any case, my group will ensure that this role of the EP administration and the responsibility of the Secretary-General are discussed. My group is getting the situation right with the amendments that we are putting forward.

Going into detail, I strongly remark that the biggest issue, as far as the discharge procedure is concerned, is the lack of cooperation on the Council’s side. In 2009, the Council refused to cooperate in the discharge procedure as implemented by Parliament, failing to provide the necessary information asked for in written questions, and did not attend debates on the implementation of its own budget. Answers to our questions are essential for the discharge procedure. We need answers about the main weaknesses found by the ECA which, among others, are the high amounts of appropriations being carried over from 2015-2016, particularly those on property, plant and equipment, the delivery delay on the Europa building, and unclear building policy. The question of job tier balance, which should remain an important element of resources management, particularly with respect to the Member States that have acceded to the Union in 2004. Member States which acceded to our Union in 2004, or later, are still under-represented at the higher level of administration, in managerial posts, for which progress is still awaited.

This is a gloss, a flagrant attempt to disguise the fact that, in the audit that matters, year after year the EU’s general budget accounts fail to meet minimum accounting standards. To quote Mr Zeller’s statement, we deeply regret that, for the 22nd year in a row, payments are materially affected by error because of the fact that the supervisory and control systems are only partially effective. This means that we have ended up with a 3.8% error rate, with thousands of millions of euros not properly accounted for – not just this year, but year after year.

It was planned to essentially separate the Organization into an administrative department, which remained in Heraklion, and a scientific department, which came to Athens. While it has free space of 4.5 thousand square meters in Heraklion, in order to stay, nevertheless the organization insists on coming to Athens, and even the report says so; it now refers to the efforts of the Organization to leave Heraklion and come to Athens, because it has, he says, expenses. But he created the expenses, because the leadership of the Organization wanted to come to Athens! To stay in Heraklion! This is the decision.

I would like to thank everyone who spoke here today for the kind words that have been said to us - to the Court of Auditors. Mr Lazarou and I - I should like to draw your particular attention to Mr Lazarou, because he was the person who did most of the work in preparing the Court of Auditors' annual report because he is our Court's main rapporteur - and his colleagues - he himself saw all of this -, but I will also be very, very happy to pass on these good wishes and the many thanks that have been given to his colleagues. I am sure that it will please all of you and encourage you to continue doing good work in the interests of our common cause in the future. I heard a lot today when I could have applauded loudly, but as President of the European Court of Auditors I am no longer entitled to do so in this House. That is why I take the liberty of giving back this thank you and this applause literally, so to speak, without being able to formally express and carry it out. I would like to end by saying something about a number of points. I have a lot of sympathy for the idea of ​​reducing the medium-term financial framework from seven to five years. This is a topic that also played a role in our internal discussions. It would certainly have the great advantage - if I may say that as a personal opinion here - that every parliament, every legislator, would then have the opportunity to contribute to a medium-term financial framework, because the legislative period of the European Parliament and also the scope of activities of European Commission covers this period of five years. That is a very interesting consideration. Another point concerns the question of shadow budgets, which is also various been addressed. It is of course right that certain areas - ESM, ESFS - have been raised - are outside the contractual framework of the Community structure; that won't be possible there. But in the debates that took place in connection with the statements on the MFF, completely different things were also discussed, which are very much outside of the existing structures and which one has to think about - if only from the point of view of transparency - to bring them back into the structure of the budget in the foreseeable future - sometime -. That will not be possible everywhere either, but one should at least have the goal in mind so that in the end - as the chairman of the Committee on Budgets in this House once said - one does not have a galaxy of budgets and transparency and clarity are retained. With all that has been said, perhaps I would like to break a lance for all of us who have been trying for years to improve the situation significantly and to see the whole picture. I myself have been a member of this House for 20 years and have now been a member of the Court of Auditors for more than three years. I think I have some overview of this period. When I look at the situation and the situation from 20 years ago, where there were no functioning internal controls by the Commission, and where we as the Court of Auditors did not yet publish specific error rates because everyone knew that in certain sectors of the budget, double-digit error rates existed, and I compare the situation then with the situation we have today, where we have made tremendous progress, where we have really made significant changes towards significantly better budgetary and financial management, then I believe is Overall, a great deal has been achieved in these 20 years. Not yet enough, it can get better.That is why the criticism is always right - and we have to develop further, but when you look at the picture as a whole, I do believe that these have been huge steps forward.We have to keep working on it.On our part, I can promise Mr. Novakov in particular that we will determine even more analytical, concrete information in the future and make it available to you for your consultations.We are also of the opinion that mere numbers and statistics alone are not enough, but that we need “more” information for qualitative tests.We will do our part to do this.I thank you for the attention.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 282, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen!

I would like to thank President Lehne, Commissioner Oettinger and many colleagues for addressing things that I could not mention earlier due to the passage of time, but which are also very important to me. That is the treatment of the issue of shadow budgets and secondary budgets, in which there is a lot of European money from the budget, but which contain problems with parliamentary control and risks in the control and coordination of EU strategies. I would like to point out that at the end of 2015 there were more than 1,000 financial instruments, but where the outflow of funds to the beneficiaries was very different. There have been countries where not even 40 of these funds have been passed on to the beneficiaries. I think the Commission should be bolder here and recover funds that have not been used. In addition, the question for the future is: do we always reach the right people? If I have to state that 80% of the agricultural funds that are paid out only go to 20% of the beneficiaries, I believe there is a disproportion that we should face, especially since agriculture can now also make good money, as evidenced by constantly rising land prices for agricultural land. 2015 was also the year of the payment overhang for the previous funding period, although we were already in the second year of the start of the new funding period. In the Member States, not even 20% of the administrative bodies had yet been designated and certified, which means there is a risk of further delay in the implementation of the structural funds, which we should and must now face in our mid-term review. At the same time, there is a second report that I would like to refer to, namely the summary of all the special and special reports by the Court of Auditors, for which I am very grateful because they provide valuable information and which, unfortunately, from God in the Technical committees, for which they are actually intended, have not yet received the appreciation and discussion that they are worth.Thank you very much, and I hope that both reports will now not only disappear into files, but that what has been said by everyone will form the basis for our further work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 285, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Younous OMARJEE", "mepid": "30482", "text": "protractor. - Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Oettinger, Mr Borg and Mr Lehne for their comments.

What I really only want to comment on is the discussion that has just arisen about what the previous President of Parliament may or may not have done. I must say, as rapporteur, I do not like it when a colleague, including from the Committee on Budgetary Control, is being blamed. I know the chairman as an extremely hard-working chairman of this committee, with whom I have done many things together. I do not think it does justice to anyone, but certainly not the chairman, to detract from that.

Then there were clear paragraphs about the President's behavior. These have suddenly disappeared in plenary, at least with the consent of the large groups.

In other words, 15 members were in favor and 14 had either some reservations or of course they were against. I would also like to refer to the misfortune that the motivation is purely political, when historically and traditionally the Committee on Budgetary Control tends to have institutional respect precisely for the electoral procedures of the Member States. In fact, we do not travel, we do not do missions, precisely respecting that situation scrupulously. Despite this, as early as 2014, despite the fact that President Martin Schulz had been in the Presidency for two years, precisely that year, in which he became the Spitzenkandidat of the Socialists, he was attacked for the first time. Not before. This year. And precisely by whom? By your German colleagues from the PPE. Last year we returned to the fray. But last year we were finally able to negotiate, precisely after both the president, Martin Schulz, and the general secretary, representing the administration, gave us answers to all the questions that had been raised in the previous questionnaire.

With an own-initiative report, the European Parliament would like to focus on a matter, a question or a region. I think that was achieved in the own-initiative report on the management of the fishing fleets in the outermost regions. The report calls for better data programs to be developed, particularly with regard to the state of the stocks. In order to reduce illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, better controls are needed. The report therefore calls for active measures such as monitoring and negotiations to be launched with neighboring countries with which fisheries partnership agreements have not yet been concluded. These agreements are also intended to take account of the interests of the outermost regions by landing catches in these areas and giving preference to locals when placing jobs on the fishing vessels. The Commission has asked to review the development of a financial instrument based on the POSEI for fisheries in the outermost regions. It is also proposed to increase the aid intensity for new engines. Here I would like, I have to mention, that the EMFF already provides for compensation for additional costs, which are 100% subsidized by the fisheries fund, for these areas and have been increased compared to the previous fund. In addition, the aid intensity for other measures in these areas has been increased by 35%. The Member States and the outermost regions are encouraged to make the best possible use of the de minimis or block exemption regime. Synergies between the various European structural and investment funds should be better represented. The report therefore makes a number of proposals for better exploiting the fishing potential in the areas outermost. Some proposals imply an exemption for these outermost regions. These are to be seen as an addition to the existing ones. I would now like to comment on the amendment that was the only one tabled that calls for public funding for new ships. A corresponding amendment - I shall call it the previous amendment - was rejected in the Fisheries Committee. I acknowledge that the amendment tabled for plenary now states that the capacity limits of the common fisheries policy must be respected and that funding can only be provided in exchange for an old ship. In addition, it must be possible to achieve the desired maximum possible long-term yield. I would like to say, however, that the exchange of old and new is already possible today, but without public funding, mind you. The authors of the amendment refer to Article 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Yes, Article 349 can be the basis for specific measures in the outermost regions. However, these specific measures must be designed in such a way that they do not undermine the coherence and integrity of a common policy. The common fisheries policy and the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund do not allow public financing of new buildings. All of this can be found in Article 23 of the Basic Regulation and Article 11 of the EMFF. According to the amendment, fishing boats should be made safer and more environmentally friendly. There is already money in the EMFF for this. Article 32 should be mentioned here, for example. In addition, the demand for public support for ships does not seem to me to be coherent with the EU initiative launched within the framework of the WTO to force a ban on subsidies in the fishing sector. I am going to vote against this amendment because it is against them GFP and opens Pandora's box.This is where fishing is going on for future subsidies for fisheries in other regions, and other fishermen in the EU would then rightly request public funds for new buildings.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 293, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Günther Oettinger", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "Member of the Commission. - Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen! On behalf of the Commission, I should like to thank Parliament, and in particular the rapporteur, Mrs Rodust, and her team, for producing this extremely knowledgeable report. Personally, I am not a specialist, but I read the report and learned a lot in the process. It is well-balanced, presents the difficulties of the fishing industry in the outermost regions in a very specific way, and it also proposes very specific measures on how to tackle the problems and stabilize the sector. We accept, and are also acting as the Commission ourselves, that the special conditions in these outermost regions call for tailor-made solutions. With the redesign of the common fisheries policy and our common financing instrument, the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, we have also taken important future-oriented steps. With the next budget, and even more so with the next budget and program period, we will try to further improve these measures on the basis of your proposals. The measures are exclusive access conditions, the regionalization of conservation measures, the special advisory board proposed here, measures for small fleets, a greater intensity of financial aid, a system to compensate for additional costs, to name just a few essential ones. In addition, we also support the work of national and regional levels and authorities and provide suggestions here. The whole thing is a joint task of the European level, but also of the national authorities and the regional authorities. Just examples where regional and national authorities are important: The new framework for scientific fisheries data proposed by the Commission contains specific requirements for the areas in outermost location.However, the responsibility for implementing the requirements lies largely with the Member States and the research institutes, which are supported by the Member States, and in part also with the entrepreneurs in the fishing industry themselves.

I am aware that some of the outermost regions are poor. This is and was the reason why I initiated this report. Yes, the outermost regions and fishing conditions are not comparable to those in continental Europe. That is why the Common Fisheries Policy and the EMFF contain exceptions for these areas, that is, with these exceptions, the special features are taken into account or I have added further special features and improvements in the report. Here it is argued that new buildings are necessary in order to be able to reach distant stocks because the stocks within the 100 nautical miles have been fished out or there is environmental pollution. When I was on Reunion Island, I was told that the pollution was caused by pesticides from banana plantations, for example. Maybe the national government should do something about that. The fish stocks in the outermost regions are plentiful - I would like to believe that. But how do I deal with the 2016 report from STECF which failed to assess the balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities for all fleets in the outermost regions. This was mainly due to the fact that the biological data were insufficient. The data situation must therefore be improved. This is what it says in the report now. In the meantime, however, I have to ask myself what public financing of new buildings means against this background. I would now like to close with a question - it is probably a rhetorical question. Would the undersigned Members, who are not from the outermost regions, explain to fishermen in their regions that they are demanding public funding for new construction in remote areas? But not for them, for their fishermen since they are not that special.For me, this takes Pandora's box very strongly - since then, of course, other fishermen in the EU can rightly claim public funds for new buildings.They too have ships that are 30 to 40 years old and would be happy to get public funding.That is why I am going to reject this amendment tomorrow.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 309, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "I close the debate.The vote will take place on Thursday 27 April 2017.

It cost the lives of more than 1,100 people and injured more than 2,500. The difficulty in establishing legal responsibilities for this crime showed that production chains as complex as that of textiles require control standards in accordance with it. But it also fostered awareness about the origin of the clothes we wear: people do not want to continue dressing at the cost of the slavery of others. And what is the European Union doing to ensure the dignity of women workers in the textile sector? It is true that initiatives have been launched by public and private actors to try to respond to citizen pressure; but all of them are voluntary, many of them are simple image washes that have not prevented the continued exploitation in the factories. Furthermore, many of these initiatives overlap and do not cover the entire supply chain. Therefore, the problem continues, and it is deregulation. In 2015, the European Commission promised an initiative on the sustainability of the sector at a global level, which it also called \"emblematic\". Two years later, it can be said that they have done practically nothing, because the working document, which they happen to present this week, is not going to end the abuses. Seventy-five million people live their particular Rana Plaza every day around the world: it is urgent that we take a step forward. This report aims to put an end to this situation, invisible in the Western world, but of which consumers involuntarily take advantage every time we get dressed. The most important dimensions of the report are, in the first place, that relating to working conditions and social standards under which they are produced our clothes, because too many times they are abusive, exploitative conditions, without collective rights or even using child labor. Endless working days that sometimes last up to 24 hours; unattainable production goals, like sewing one T-shirt per minute; constant sexual harassment as a weapon against female workers; facilities that would scare us away due to their hygiene and safety conditions, and a long list that forces us to get down to business. The second dimension is related to transparency and traceability. The textile sector chain is especially complex, as demonstrated by the impossibility of establishing legal responsibilities after the Rana Plaza. We can find a cotton shirt collected by children in Uzbekistan, dyed in Morocco, made in Sri Lanka and with buttons sewn by exploited women in Honduras. This industrial model makes the traceability of each garment especially difficult. For this reason, clear and concrete criteria are necessary to ensure transparency effectively. We have the right to know what we wear. Finally, there is the normative dimension. If we have seen something in recent years, it is that voluntary initiatives do not work. Our societies are based on a social contract. A universal and inalienable contract by means of which we organize and regulate relationships with our peers. Volunteering is legitimate when it comes to choosing our friends or our haircut, but it is not when the fundamental rights of people and their dignity are at stake.

We think back to 2013 and 1100 people and many more injuries that were recorded back then. We had a commemoration today under the auspices of Mrs McAvan, who chairs her technical committee, and you, Mrs Sánchez Caldentey, and Arne Lietz, and my colleague Mimica, were also there. You discussed the question of the entire value chain in the textile industry and how it can be made more sustainable and fairer. Like Parliament, the Commission is pursuing two goals: We want to do everything we can to prevent a similar tragedy in the future. And secondly: we want to approach the partner countries together with the Member States, to work with them so that their fellow citizens - the people there - receive decent and sustainable jobs with which they can increasingly earn a living for themselves and their families. My colleague Mimica also presented the working document on sustainable value creation in the clothing industry today. In terms of development policy in particular, the report from your technical committee is in line with our considerations and the ongoing work of the commission, which is also shown in writing in this working document. Promoting sustainable value creation is a contribution, but an essential contribution to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. It is and will remain our declared goal to work towards sustainable value chains in the textile industry. This assumes that we include all relevant internal as well as external policy areas and on the Pay attention to the economic, social and ecological consequences. Our activities are part of a more comprehensive strategy that we are undertaking together with the G20, G7, the OECD and other global institutions. From your draft report and also from our working document it emerges that the value chains in the textile industry are characterized by particularly complex purchasing models, ranging from fibers and fabrics to fabric finishing, clothing to wholesalers and retailers and end consumers. The textile industry worldwide, but also in Europe, is often affected by particular economic, social and ecological challenges such as low wages and long working hours, such as forced labor, as is often the case with child labor, such as the lack of real fair employment contracts, such as the lack of enforcement of collective rights or freedom of association such as low Safety and workplace standards, such as inadequate health protection in the workplace, such as: The workplace is associated with dangerous chemicals. On the one hand, the textile sector makes a significant contribution to economic growth and employment. It can improve people's standard of living, but on the other hand the conditions are often inadequate for this. The Commission is in communication with our partner countries through a wide variety of channels. In development cooperation, we help partner countries by promoting gender equality, women's economic participation, the Decent Work Agenda, improving transparency and traceability in the industry itself. We intend to continue and strengthen this promotion. The Commission recently launched projects worth € 45 million on decent work, transparency, traceability, strengthening value chains in Burkina Faso and Mali and more. All in all, we have to drill a thick board - we are nowhere near where we want to be, but we are thoughtful, sustainable, and your report encourages us to continue our work through various services with various partners in the interests of human dignity, justice andwith the aim of making what we can all remember today on this fourth anniversary, avoidable in the future as far as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 314, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Jean LAMBERT", "mepid": "4531", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Mr President, I speak not only as the rapporteur for opinion on employment, but also the person who chairs Parliament’s Delegation for Relations with South Asia, which includes Bangladesh.

First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Lola Sánchez Caldentey, and everyone involved in the report, for the very, very good cooperation. I mentioned the German Textile Alliance in my first development policy speech in the European Parliament. It is a voluntary multi-stakeholding initiative for the safe and fairly paid production of textiles, which has developed positively in recent years. France has now passed a law on mandatory due diligence in the clothing supply chain. Trade policy is European policy. That is why the aim must be to anchor such legislation at the European level. The new OECD guidelines for responsible supply chains in the clothing and footwear sector from February 2017 must be made binding. That is exactly what we are calling for in this report. The EU Commission has unfortunately taken too long to bring the promised flagship initiative for the European clothing industry into being. The EU Commission's working document published today can only be a first step. With this report, the European Parliament is giving an impetus so that, four years after the Rana Plaza disaster, we can finally come up with legislation on due diligence in the clothing supply chain. That would make a necessary European fashion revolution possible. The EU institutions and member states should first set their own example and make their own public procurement sustainable and fair. In addition to the report, the EU Commission and the European Parliament should actively support IndustriALL's ACT initiative following global collective bargaining in the clothing industry. The clothing supply chain is an excellent example of the development policy goals for 2030, to connect them coherently and to make them visible, z.For example, goal 8 - good work and living wages - or goal 12 of responsible production and consumption or goal 5 of equal rights for men and women.We have made good headway with this report and now hope that the Commission will draft the legislative process as soon as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 317, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Beatriz BECERRA BASTERRECHEA", "mepid": "125040", "text": "on behalf of the ALDE Group. - Mr President, Commissioner, it has just been four years since the collapse of the Rana Plaza in Bangladesh: More than a thousand people died who made the clothes we wear every day.

Well, it's 1906. One hundred and eleven years ago. And do you know what that catastrophe led to? It's called the 'Courrières Catastrophe', in a mine in northern France, very close to here. This led the French government to develop and implement the workers' statute and to create a Ministry of Labor and Workers. These misfortunes, together with popular pressure, are what get legislation to be enacted. Without legislation, slavery will not end. And now, I go with my intervention. Because I was in Sri Lanka a week ago. There I met many people; but, among others, I met Mahida. Mahida is eighteen years old. He gets up, in his village, at five in the morning, to get to the factory where he spends at least nine hours on his feet, working tirelessly. He works for a well known European lingerie brand. He works twenty-seven days a month. They give you thirty minutes a day to eat and go to the bathroom. They have made him sign a contract in which he agrees not to unionize. If she tries, she will be fired, without compensation. Every day she has to reach a production target that, moreover, is constantly increasing. As she touches her waist, her boss threatens to follow her home if she doesn't achieve those goals. She charges eighty euros a month, which is not even close to the vital minimum. She is poor and she will remain so no matter how hard she works. If she wants to charge something more, she will have to spend twelve, fifteen, seventeen hours a day on her feet, sewing incessantly, and she will arrive at her house at night with broken fingers. No labor inspector will ever go to her factory. I don't dare tell her that with two or three garments of the hundreds that she produces per day she has already paid her salary, because I am ashamed. But she I assure, I assure Mahida that, in Europe, there are more and more people who care about her and who are not willing to allow some to dress us, and also enrich themselves, with the invisible slavery of others, especially womenlike Mahida, who live poorly so we can be fashionable.I think the Commission has a very clear message.He must urgently present a legislative initiative on binding rules on due diligence, so that cases like Mahida's, like that of Rana Plaza, like that of all the individual Rana Plaza that these people live every day, never happen again.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 330, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Bogusław LIBERADZKI", "mepid": "23768", "text": "I close the debate.The vote will take place on Thursday 27 April 2017.

Many textiles in everyday use that contain hazardous chemicals used in production are banned or regulated under REACH in Europe, such as formaldehyde or perfluorocarbons. Washing clothes releases harmful chemicals. These textiles are not only dangerous at the manufacturing stage and for workers along the supply chain, but they are also dangerous for consumers in everyday use. The chemicals in clothes are released into the water system when they are washed, which puts a strain on the environment. Consumers should be informed about the consequences of cheap clothing.

It is a few minutes before midnight and a long working day is coming to an end. And yet there is still an important topic on the agenda. While we are thinking about various topics here, behind our backs - without us noticing it or without noticing it - the agricultural country in Europe is increasingly falling into the hands of fewer. In the hands of a few large corporations, in the hands of some non-agricultural corporations. Three percent of the farms currently control over 50 percent of the area in Europe. I think that this number alone should be enough to make the extent of this extreme situation clear. The own-initiative report on the status of the concentration of agricultural land in Europe and, quite clearly, the second part of the report - namely, how it is possible for farmers to gain access to land - has been launched. I would like to mention very briefly eight points that we achieved in the report and, first of all, I would like to thank all the shadow rapporteurs very warmly for the exceptionally good cooperation, which is truly unparalleled. The report clearly states that land is not a normal, tradable commodity. Of course we stand by the four fundamental freedoms in the EU, but land is not a normal, tradable commodity! The report also notes that we as the EU Parliament, but also as the Commission, must do everything we can to actually implement the voluntary guidelines in the Member States. We must also support the Member States in stopping the sell-off of their agricultural land. On the one hand, a sale means: a sale by other EU member states or, of course, by third countries. We are very clearly asking the Commission - and that is one of the central points - a catalog of criteria that clearly puts the criteria on the table, such as Member States in the EU can protect their country from being sold out without discrimination. We clearly state that there are major problems in the area of ​​corruption. We suggest that the EU set up an observatory for the land market that really acts jointly with clear data and thus enables an overview of how the concentration of agricultural land in the EU is continuing. We clearly state - and this is very important to me as a member of the SPD - that the aim in Europe is for the diversification of property to contribute to social stability. Scattering of property is not socialist devil stuff, but brings stability to a society. Property dispersion is good and needs to be encouraged. We repeat - and this as an important point too - the cornerstones of European agricultural policy and the cornerstones of the European agricultural model. Agricultural policy is more than the production of products - that is important and correct, but agricultural policy or the European agricultural model includes much more - from climate protection to water protection and biodiversity. If you want to support a good European agricultural model, you have to rely on and build on many players. That means we need a lot of farmers, we don't just need a few. And we clearly state the connection that the concentration of money in fewer and fewer hands has the same step as the concentration of agricultural land in fewer and fewer hands in the EU. The report also makes a clear statement about the future of the EU's agricultural policy. If we continue to believe that we can structure our main support in the agricultural sector purely through area subsidies, we will notice that the way in which area subsidies here in Europe is actually a driver in this area. Our way of subsidizing continues to lead to concentrations in the agricultural sector, in the area of ​​land. That is, have here we do our homework.The ball is now clearly with the Commission;the ball lies in the Member States, because that is an issue that concerns the Member States.We as Parliament have made our point clear;I think we will vote on the report tomorrow by a very large majority.We are seldom so in agreement that the concentration of agricultural land must finally be stopped.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 336, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Maria Lidia SENRA RODRÍGUEZ", "mepid": "125049", "text": "- Mr President, the hoarding and concentration of agricultural land is a very serious problem in the European Union, which makes it difficult for young people and people without land to settle, and which also prevents the resizing of smaller farms.

I just want to mention agricultural policy as an example - it has already been said -, regional development, financial and investment policy - all of these have an impact on the question of land: who has access to land, who speculates with land and who tries to use it as an investment good to use? But it must be clear to us that land is not only the basis of life for us farmers, and that we farmers produce for this domestic market. We must then all be able to sell in the same market. So it is very important that the European Union also creates guidelines here, that we have a starting point for all farmers and that we have protection for the livelihoods not only of the farmers, but for us humans as a whole.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "google", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 338, "date": "2017-04-26.json", "name": "Krisztina MORVAI", "mepid": "96661", "text": "- Mr President, I consider this report to be historic, which finally states that the purpose of arable land is to ensure the life and livelihood of the local population and to produce local healthy food.

I would like to thank Mrs Noichl and her colleagues who, I believe, have carried out an important analysis of the ownership and use of agricultural land in Europe with this report and who, here too, document concerns that we as the Commission share. Because land plays an important role in our economies, but it also has a socio-political function. Ownership of land - agricultural and forestry land - as well as real estate has a stabilizing effect on our citizens, who thereby document their knowledge and responsibility for the European Union, our regions and our communities. I believe that one conclusion must be drawn from the further development of our common agricultural policy and what will then be in the budget for the next few years: How do we train farmers of the next generation to remain in this profession and to see a perspective , and how do we create prospects for smallholder agriculture despite all the concentration in the food industry? We have a trade-off here. On the one hand: freedom of investment is of course anchored in European law. Everyone, big and small, can invest in goods. As an EU citizen in your own country, in another country in the European Union, and third parties are also invited. Conversely - and this is first and foremost a matter for the Member States - they have the opportunity to take measures against land concentration and thus against land speculation, in order to preserve rural communities and also to put agricultural land under a certain protection. In doing so, they must observe European law. Over the past few years we have - and will continue to do so - advised the Member States and, with them and the regions, we also advised them tries to show how appropriate protective measures and restrictions can be brought into line with European law and how it is ensured that they are neither directly nor indirectly discriminatory.We believe that, on the basis of your report, we should continue these discussions with the Member States, and I therefore look forward to further discussions with you, but also with our Member States.I will come back to this as the Commissioner

Furthermore, its expansion not only causes the disappearance of forest masses of high environmental value, but also invades quality agricultural land.

European values ​​that made us dominate the world - European culture was a model for the whole world. Meanwhile, the opposite values ​​recommended by the European Union mean that we are flooded by colonizers from other countries, Europe is dying, there is no economic development, no children are born, because these are exactly opposite values. And we will defend European values ​​against Union values. For example, the abolition of the death penalty is an EU value that is contrary to a European value.

But, in view of Maduro's demonstrated ability to manipulate electoral acts, and in the current climate of repression, how can we believe that this electoral process can offer any democratic guarantees? What the Venezuelan people demand is the immediate end of the dictatorial regime in Maduro, a government of national salvation and transition, which can face the serious humanitarian crisis created by Maduro and the disarmament of armed groups, the release of political prisoners, the purification public powers and the call for free and democratic elections. No more, no less! This is the will of the courageous people of Venezuela and the Portuguese who accepted the great Venezuelan nation as their second home.
