I would remind honourable Members that, for this occasion, there is no catch-the-eye procedure and no 'blue card' applications will be accepted.  Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Madam President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, thank you for being here with us to celebrate together the tenth anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and the legally binding Charter of Fundamental Rights.  On 1 December, during a beautiful ceremony at the House of European History in the presence of Presidents Ursula von der Leyen, Charles Michel and Christine Lagarde, we wanted to symbolically commemorate this anniversary and greet the beginning of the new institutional cycle of this legislature. Every time we come to Strasbourg and pass through Germany, we cross a border, and we do not notice it, but it is a border that has been bloodied for generations of Europeans since 1870.  It is normal for us to cross it in peace, but this is an achievement, it has been a great achievement, and we should not take it for granted, especially now that we are celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Battle of the Bulge, which awarded tens of thousands of victims, young Europeans and marked several generations. It is important to remember that the European project is the only one that has enabled us to build an area of peace, freedom and democracy. These are the values that we must defend every day, working for the European Union and making it stronger and more effective. The entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon ten years ago was a great step forward for the European institutions and for the citizens, for our countries and, in particular, for Parliament, for European democracy, because it strengthened the democratic character of our Union, its effectiveness, its transparency and also gave an important role to its citizens. The citizens have a renewed voice with the Treaty of Lisbon. For ten years, Parliament has shared with the Council the adoption of the Union's annual budget and has played an even greater role in the implementation of European policies, but let us not forget that behind the figures, the budget lines and the financial framework there are always people and it is to them that Europe must be able to provide answers.  Thanks to the Treaty of Lisbon, respect for human dignity, freedom, equality, democracy, solidarity and the rule of law have become pillars on which the European Union is founded and have been legally binding on all Member States and institutions for ten years.  Unfortunately, discrimination also continues to affect our countries. The news tirelessly reminds us that violence against women and racism, various forms of intolerance are still humiliating so many European citizens. On the occasion of this anniversary, just a few days before International Day of Human Solidarity, I would like to renew our commitment to a freer and more supportive Europe.  We must continue to think about our future together. We have to walk together.  With great participation in the last elections, our citizens sent us a clear message: they want to contribute more to the European project.  I am convinced that the Conference for the Future of Europe, which we intend to set up in the coming months, is and will be an opportunity that we must not miss. It will be an opportunity to listen to the citizens, to understand their expectations and needs and also their hopes and to enable our democracy to function better.  It will be our duty to put these demands into practice and to complete this task in order to ensure that a Union that is able to face even more effectively the global challenges that lie ahead.  Of course, all this will have to be translated into parliamentary acts and politics, and I believe that our generation can rise to these challenges.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Manfred WEBER", "mepid": "28229", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, let’s face it – with the Lisbon Treaty, Europe settled after the failure to create a true European constitution.  We were not put down; instead, we learned from our setbacks, we actually made progress thanks to a moment of crisis of the European Union. The Lisbon Treaty created a union out of a community. It gave Europe a political face to speak as one in foreign policy, sitting at the same table of world leaders at NATO and, for example, on the Iran nuclear deal. It strengthens the role of citizens. Co-decision became the central way of legislation in Europe. The European Parliament, our institution, is today a powerful institution, and we added new responsibilities to the European level. The fight against crime, exchange of data, parts of the asylum policy became European issues. This decision has brought Europe more security and safety, and it gave a binding character to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, embedding our European way of life. The Charter tells us what it means to be in a European – social market economy, protection of our environment, rule of law, democracy and freedom.  Europe has never walked in a straight line. Both progress and setbacks shape it. The Lisbon Treaty was a huge step towards a modern way of cooperation among the European Union Member States.  Edmund Burke said ‘a state without the means of some change is without the means for its conservation’. So 10 years after the Lisbon Treaty, let us take the next bold steps now. The upcoming Conference on the Future of Europe is the best opportunity for doing so. As Giscard D’Estaing opened the European Convention, he said ‘let’s dream of Europe’ and I would say let’s dream again.  As our community develops, we must now answer fundamental questions. What are the main areas where the European Union must act in the future? We must carry out a competence check in the European Union. The European Union must focus only on issues where we really have a positive impact on citizens’ daily life. Still, in necessary fields, the EU also needs the right tools to act.  A second point for the future – how can we strengthen the parliamentary democracy at European level? – is still at stake. Because the citizens will only trust Europe when they will hold decision makers accountable. And a third point: how can we strengthen Europe’s role in the world? Standing in the clash between China and the US, Europe can either get lost in the chaos or speak with one voice. In our election campaign as the EPP this year, the listening tour was our starting point. Let’s now write the history of our union together with the people, working side by side with the citizens, national and regional parliaments, with the European Parliament in the central role as the House of the elected representatives.  For the European People’s Party Group we have a clear idea. It will be not about the minimum common denominator, but the best possible sum of our ideas. It will not be a theoretical exercise, but a concrete start for a more democratic Europe and it will not be a technical exercise, but a real debate about what it means to be a European. To create next to our national identity also the European identity. Let this 10-year anniversary be the start of a new European dream. The EPP group is ready to make the difference.

We can say that, in its day, the Treaty of Lisbon was a success of the Portuguese Presidency, with a Socialist Government, at a very delicate time for the Union project. We all recall the trauma of the rejection of the European Constitution by two of our Member States in 2005 and the uncertainty that this generated. However, we must recognise that the work of the Convention in 2002 and 2003 was not in vain and that an important effort was made to retake the Union's challenges. Communities had focused too much on market issues, on market aspects, forgetting that we were able to make a process much more ambitious. We want a European democracy capable of solving the problems of citizens. Issues such as fundamental rights, the Europe of citizenship and also the promoting of social rights needed to be addressed. However, the referendums in France and the Netherlands showed that at least part of the citizenship did not feel involved in the process. Fortunately, many important aspects were included in the Lisbon Treaty and significant progress has been made as a result. On the one hand, the European Union now has legal personality and can adhere to international treaties and conventions. And the role of our house, Parliament, has also been greatly strengthened and citizen participation improved. The Charter of Fundamental Rights is legally binding and the rights of European citizenship have been enhanced. That's enough? Of course not. It is clear that citizens expect more from us, and that is why the Conference on the Future of Europe is an opportunity that we cannot pass by to relaunch the process of integration and make it more democratic, more dynamic and closer to people. Let's not make the mistakes of the past. Citizenship and civil society must be available from the outset; who feel engaged. And we can't make a priori decisions without counting on them. Actually, if there is political will, we can do much more with the Treaty. There's still a tour. For example, consolidate the list head system as well as transnational lists. With political will we could overcome the paralysis of unanimity on issues as important as taxation or foreign policy. And so we would achieve fair taxation and we could overcome situations such as the blockade, for example, of the accession negotiations of North Macedonia and Albania. Nor can we waste a minute on this issue. In reality, the members of the Council know this and, that is why, last week, they found a way to overcome unanimity informally to ensure carbon neutrality by 2050. I hope that it will not be left alone there and that the Council will formally agree to reduce the decision-making areas unanimously. Only in this way can we react in time, with determination to the challenges we face.  We started a new political cycle and it's time to be brave. Europe is not what it was ten years ago. We could talk about climate emergency, gender-based violence, refugees knocking on Europe's doorstep in the hope of having a future, child poverty; so many issues that we have to work on. Let us take this opportunity seriously and work with citizens and civil society to make our Europe stronger and better.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 3, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Pascal DURAND", "mepid": "124693", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President, Madam President, we are at a very important time for the European Union. As you said in your inaugural address, you know, Mr President, you who have just accepted an extremely important office: ten years is a good age. In France, it is the age when children go from school to college and then to high school, i.e. they are entering a new era, a new life, the one where they separate a little - I was going to say, from the comfort of school - to go towards a situation that is more complicated, that allows them to face the world that comes. The world has changed in ten years; you know, we know that. The challenge we face now is no longer the challenge we faced ten years ago. Climate issues, social issues, issues of migration, population displacement, issues of democracy, the danger to our democracies and sometimes within the Union itself, the rule of law, are new subjects. We need to change the rules. In a changing world, we must also change our own rules, we must do so in a democratic way and with respect for the rule of law; I say this, and I turn to the Council: intergovernmentality must evolve, you must now rely more on the representatives of the citizens, that is, the European Parliament. The Lisbon Treaty made this first step. It is absolutely essential to continue in this process and the Council itself must become more transparent. Then the Commission will be able to rely on two co-legislators. Yes, this has just been explained. The Conference on the Future of Europe, which you referred to in your speech, Madam President, is something essential, again. In ten years, citizens and civil society have entered the public debate. We must now take into account, in an extremely strong way, their expectations. We cannot continue a European Union against or without citizens and civil society. That is why, for this Conference on the Future of Europe, we must not just listen to the citizens, we must involve them in our European project, to ensure that, finally, in the 21st century, there is a European citizenship that is being established, which is not the sum of the 27 citizenships of each member State. There is something higher: it is the general European interest. Madam President, Mr President, I know that Parliament will be there to help you ensure that citizens enter the public debate and civil society as well. Help us, do not let this opportunity pass us by, which is perhaps one of Europe's last chances to be able to get closer to its citizens. Mr President, I will conclude on that, 70 years ago, another event took place. Sir Winston Churchill spoke a few hundred yards from here, at Kléber Square, on a balcony, and he just said these few words, and I would like to quote them because it remains relevant: \"The dangers that threaten us are great, but great is also our strength. There is no reason not to succeed in achieving the goal and establishing the structure of this united Europe.\" This was true 70 years ago, and it is even more true than ever today.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ten years ago, when I had just joined the European Parliament, the Lisbon Treaty was coming into force. Even today, I welcome what I see as a step forward in the construction of this transnational democracy that the European Union is destined to become. Without Lisbon, this Parliament would not have won the right to ratify or not ratify international treaties, it would not have won the right to co-decide, in most European matters, or to audition and appoint the main European leaders, starting with the European Commission. It is also in Lisbon that the Charter of Fundamental Rights has acquired this legally binding character in order to better protect dignity, freedom, equality, solidarity, citizenship and justice for all in the Union. But I also cannot ignore the fact that, for many of our fellow citizens, particularly in France, the Netherlands and Ireland, the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty was seen as a denial of their refusal, a refusal often motivated by the maintenance, at the very heart of the new Treaty, of outrageously neoliberal provisions, for example the central bank's ban on financing public investments, or the sanctification of the freedom of movement of capital, which is elevated to the rank of absolute dogma. It symbolizes in the extreme the imbalance between economic freedoms guaranteed in law and social rights, which are still too often in the status of declarations of intent. Ladies and gentlemen, the Lisbon Treaty allows the European Parliament to reject treaties which it considers to be contrary to the public interest. Let us dare, ladies and gentlemen, to do so by rejecting the free trade treaty with Mercosur, which can only aggravate climate change. The Lisbon Treaty also gives Parliament co-decision on the common agricultural policy, and dare we use this lever to demand a new proposal from the Commission, aligned with the Green Pact for Europe. The Lisbon Treaty opens a door for the Commission, Mrs von der Leyen, to circumvent the rule of unanimity in tax matters. Dare to use section 116 to force, or at least propose, a harmonization of corporate taxes.

Unfortunately, the reality of the situation is that that agreement has failed. And today the EU institutions are weaker. Today, Europe's citizens are weaker and today the European Union is in a deep institutional and political crisis. This is, in my view, the emblem of a failure of a centralizing policy approach that Lisbon wanted to bring, which was not respectful of the prerogatives of the nation states, the prerogatives of the peoples and the differences between european citizens, between the European nations that are seen here as a danger, whereas they must be a value, must be protected.  And Today I see similarities in the approach of that time in making the same mistakes, which, in my opinion, the Council and its predecessor, President Michel, made with regard to the Brexit referendum. At the time, the European institutions demonstrated an aversion to what was a feeling expressed by some peoples and the same mistake was made with Brexit, but the result was different.  If, then, it was possible to subvert the outcome of the Irish referendum, today, despite three years of errors and the wrong approach, in my opinion, committed by the Council, it has not been possible to subvert what was the result and the choice of the British people made in 2016.  My advice is not to make the same mistake. We will now have to negotiate an important agreement with the United Kingdom from January, and the approach that the Council in this House will have to take will not be an approach of wanting to punish the British people for their choice, an approach of trying to subvert a democratic decision made by the British people, but working towards an agreement that will protection our businesses. , which will help our citizens and allow us, even after 2020, to have a fruitful cooperation relationship with the UK.

A treaty that was supposed to be a treaty establishing a Constitution of Europe. This treaty is also one of the reasons for the establishment of the Group of European Conservatives and Reformists in the European Parliament, because we defend our European values, and they are patriotism, patriotism, traditions and a free market.  The purpose of this treaty ostensibly meant more transparency, efficiency and ness in positions, but it did lead to division and the decline of democracy. The Treaty of Lisbon has led to excessive centralisation, the seizure of competences by national states and slow and cumbersome decision-making. The bureaucracy, as well as the short-sighted decisions that have been taken, have led to doubts about the work of the institutions by citizens instead of increasing their trust. The Lisbon Treaty is also one of the reasons for Brexit.  Today, there are people in this chamber who continue to allow themselves to attack national states, to challenge the decisions of legitimately elected governments and majorities. Today, there are people in this chamber who want to be punished for their sovereign decisions, such as decisions on migration or the admission of illegal immigrants. Is that why the Lisbon Treaty gave more powers to the European Parliament? I do not want to believe that this is because it damages the credibility of the project called the European Union.  I don't believe in federalisation, I don't believe in the super-state that is currently called the European Union. I don't believe in this project that wants to replace my homeland.

Mr President, it is a strange feeling for us to celebrate the anniversary of the Lisbon Treaty, when it should not have been adopted after the results of the referendums in France, the Netherlands and Ireland. The brutal sacking of Greece confirmed the violently undemocratic nature of the current European institutions and the need to change them profoundly to face the two challenges of our time: climate change and inequality. Annexing the Charter of Fundamental Rights to the Treaty could not be enough to achieve social justice in the European Union because, as the treaties stand, this charter unfortunately remains a hide-and-seek in a soulless market. These treaties are of course not a divine word, we must be able to question them without taboo and assume to say that the new social and ecological green pact cannot be implemented with the necessary power in this current framework. Investment in the ecological transition is constrained by the golden rule that also breaks our social protection systems. We see it in France with the breakdown of our pensions, driven and supported by the European Commission and which provokes a historic mobilization, again this week. We also see this with widespread dumping, which is encouraged by the dogmas of free trade and free competition. The fight against tax evasion is also made impossible or extremely difficult as long as European tax havens, such as Ireland or Luxembourg, have a veto. These treaties are being used as an excuse to refuse to act, they are wasting our time while we have to implement a revolution unprecedented since the post-war period. These outdated rules need to be put back on track and this is an opportunity with the Conference on the Future of Europe. We need stronger democratic control with mandatory consultation of peoples, a right of initiative of Parliament, transparency of debates in the Council, zero tolerance for lobbies. We need founding principles adapted to the times, a green rule protecting natural resources, universal access to the commons, sanctified public services, solidarity protectionism. We need a renewed collective project based on social and fiscal harmonisation from the top, in short a pact of harmonious and sustainable progress, rather than growth and stability, a central bank put at the service of the ecological transition and the new green pact.

So perhaps we should be grateful that you decided to expand your power, you started creating an EU super-state and you ignored nation-states’ democracy and voters. Indeed, the Labour Party at the time didn’t give us a referendum on it, they probably regret that now, and Ireland of course had a referendum, got the wrong results and had to vote again.  Let’s remember what Margaret Thatcher said in her Bruges speech, that Europe shouldn’t be an institutional device to be constantly modified according to some abstract intellectual concept. But that is what it has become. That is what it has become.  However, of course, the Lisbon Treaty did contain Article 50, the means of leaving the EU, and even that was a trap, designed to frustrate an exiting nation until they reversed their decision.  But Britain has voted free of that, thanks to the pressure of Nigel Farage and Brexit party,  which led to a reformed Tory party under Boris Johnson. We will be leaving the EU on 31 January. So by all means, celebrate your Lisbon Treaty, but we will be celebrating the regaining of our sovereignty, independence and democracy as a free country once again.

Mr President, when we look at the beginning of this century, something was missing in the European project. The Iron Curtain had already fallen, the European Communities were already a well—established reality, and yet they lacked something. In the words of my predecessor, Jacques Delors, Europe needed a soul. He said: 'It was time to give Europe a soul.' And this is what Lisbon is all about. If you ask the lawyers, they will explain that the Lisbon Treaty has given Europe a single legal personality. Yes, of course this was so, but it is more. The Lisbon Treaty has given Europe a soul, or rather it has rediscovered Europe's true soul: the soul that made us fight against tyranny and defeat it; the soul that brought down the Iron Curtain and reunited our continent. The Lisbon Treaty went to the core of the European identity: democracy, the rule of law, rights and liberties for all. And Lisbon gave center stage to the citizens of Europe. It has brought more power to the European Parliament: the House of the European democracy. It has called national parliaments to the forefront, and it has given to the European citizens the right to call on the Commission to propose legislation. It was a breath of fresh air that went through the European democracy. The European project, yes, was built around the economy, but Europe was always meant to be more than coal and steel; more than the single market. It was always meant to be a union, and with Lisbon, Europe rediscovered this vocation. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, over the last ten years, there have been some terrible winds blowing over our Union. But our Union is like a reed, folding but not breaking. The new challenges do not paralyze it, but help it to move forward, because it draws its strength from the principles and values of its treaties and the European people. Our Union is not a fait accompli, it is a perpetual construction, it is a choice to be renewed every day and this is its beauty and its uniqueness. I am convinced that we have not yet used all the possibilities of the Lisbon Treaty. Since 2016, as German Defence Minister, I have contributed to the advancement of permanent structured defence cooperation - this is typical of Europe, to call it that - in short, the defence union. It was already in the treaties, but its potential had not been discovered. The treaty has many more to offer. And to make Europe even more efficient, stronger and more sovereign, it is now up to us to implement the full potential of Lisbon - and we have heard many proposals in this room today. As we celebrate these past ten years, our eyes are now turning to the next ten years. They will be what we want to do with them, they will be what European citizens want to do with them. At the time of Lisbon, one still wondered if Europe could have an anthem or a flag. Over the past ten years, millions of European citizens have taken to the streets, waving the blue flag to the twelve stars, our European flag. And millions of Europeans were excited to discover the notes of the 'Hymn to Joy', the wonderful anthem of our Union. Europe is its citizens. That is why the Conference on the Future of Europe must also be their conference. We need to hear what they have to say, we need to respond to their concerns and hopes. This is the best tribute we can pay to the Treaty of Lisbon, a treaty that has given Europe a soul, a treaty that has created a citizens' Europe, a treaty that has put European citizens back at the heart of the European project. Europe is their choice, it is their future, and Europe is our choice, which we must renew every day in action. Long live Europe!

Mr President, it is a pleasure to join you in celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Treaty of Lisbon. This commemoration builds a bridge between Europe's past and Europe's future, and what better place to mark this historic event than the European Parliament, a shining symbol of democracy? Institutions matter. They give legitimacy and ensure continuity, as Jean Monnet rightly said. They matter because they expand our capacity to act. They are a reflection of what we stand for. Let's look back at the moment. The Treaty of Rome confirmed the solidarity that binds Europe, it linked our fates forever. The Treaty of Maastricht recalled the historic importance of the ending of the division of the European continent; it helped heal our wounds. The Treaty of Lisbon made our Charter of Fundamental Rights legally binding. It anchored our Union in a bedrock of shared values and set the stage for the Europe we know today, founded on values and democratic institutions, respected in global affairs and committed to improving the lives of its citizens. We all feel a deep attachment to the fundamental freedoms of liberty, democracy and the rule of law. The Lisbon Treaty shines a light on these core beliefs. The Lisbon Treaty enforced our democracy by strengthening the Parliament's ability to steer a race for our Union. The Lisbon Treaty also gave Europe a more powerful voice in global affairs by synchronising Europe's foreign and security policy. Today we can present a more unified face to the rest of the world and to paraphrase former Swedish Prime Minister, Karl Bildt: I want Europe to be a player, not a plaything. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today we look forward to it. There are so many challenges: the climate, the digital agenda, peace, security, defence, the ability to speak together with a strong voice on the international stage. More than ever, I share with you the conviction that we have reason to be confident, reasons to be optimistic. A new institutional cycle is starting, with a Parliament installed - and, I understand it - mobilized, forward-looking, ready to debate, ready to take full responsibility. We know what are the common objectives, the European Commission's programme, in phase - largely - with the Strategic Agenda of the European Council' departure, this prospect of a Conference on the Future of Europe to look at how together we can roll up our sleeves, shoulder to shoulder, move things forward and make progress towards a new European momentum. Ten years after the Lisbon Treaty, which has not yet revealed - I believe - its full potential, let us look to the next ten years with confidence, optimism and hope, without ever forgetting that we must carry this dream, this European ideal, with realism, with pragmatism, but above all with great determination at the service of all European citizens. , whatever their origin, whatever their nationality, whatever their conviction, based on these values so strong that inhabit us and that animate us.

The European Commission has not been afraid to invoke its lack of competence or competence in the Member States when there is no political interest in standing up for legal protection and principles. Unfortunately, in many cases, fundamental rights become an instrument of ideological struggle and a tool for measuring double standards. Some members who are not in line and are almost always Christian-Conservative-led members are also objectionable and hold to account issues that are in violation of national sovereignty. At the same time, this rigour disappears towards other Member States, usually left-wing, liberal governments, and the all-indulgent lack of competence remains.

Since then, not much has happened other than the solemn declaration. The eu's enforceability of minority rights still encounters obstacles.

Mr President, Madam President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, it is for me both a special honour and a privilege to have the opportunity, for the first time since this new institutional cycle, to speak before this European Parliament. I would like to state at the outset my wish, my hope to develop quality inter-institutional cooperation in the service of the European project. I will try to give you a number of information in connection with the European Council that was held last week. The first point is about ambition. The ambition, in a way, to conclude a peace treaty with nature. Climate change is a threat to us and, a few hours after the European Commission announced the Green Pact for Europe - this great ambition of an action plan to win the battle against the climate threat - I am delighted to announce that the European Council has unanimously reached an agreement on the 2050 climate neutrality target. , providing for a longer period of time for a European country to implement this agreement, which was unanimously supported. It is a giant step in the right direction, in the right direction, and it allows us to make progress on what I have described, with other projects, as men and women on the moon project. I think we do need to set a course and an ambition. It's done, through this commitment. I would also like to highlight the fact that the European Council has rightly indicated, in my opinion, that this climate transition must be equitable, socially balanced, and requires financial resources. We have taken note of the announcement by the European Investment Bank of a very high ambition in terms of financing climate-related equities. We have also taken note of this ambition to set up a just transition fund to take into account a form of solidarity which must include the idea that not all European countries have the same starting point, that there are national situations that are not exactly the same. We have also noted the importance, in our view, of having a strategy that respects the choice of the individual Member States, with regard to their energy mix. These are some of the elements linked to this first essential topic for the coming years, the battle for climate change: to transform this challenge, this serious challenge, into an opportunity for more growth, more innovation, and to make Europe a leading continent for the green economy. This is a very strong ambition, and I mean all the mobilization at the outset of the European Council to try to make our political contribution to this objective as well. The next European budget will be very complex: it is a complex and a difficult issue because of the Brexit gap. We know that it means that some countries will have to pay more, and other countries will have to receive more. It means that we have to try to develop a process of negotiation between the leaders, with respect for the role of the European Parliament, based on the treaties.  This debate, the next European budget, is not only an issue of GDP percentage, it is not only an issue of national contribution - and of course it is very visible at the national level - but it is also an important question regarding the content, the priorities and the substance: what do we want to do in the next years? What is the added value we would like to develop in the next few years? It is why another important point will be the right balance we have to find between the classical European policies like agriculture and cohesion on the one hand, and on the other hand the new policies and the new challenges we have to face like migration, climate change and innovation. I think it will be very important to work with European leaders and also to work with Parliament with the support of the Commission, in order to try to take steps in the next few weeks, in the next months. Another important point with the annual budget will be the discussion regarding conditionality. For different countries, conditionality means different things: for some countries we speech about the rule of law; for other countries we speak about migration or about social or tax dumping. Another important topic regarding the European budget will be flexibility. I understand that many countries are in favor of more flexibility, and we will see if it is possible to try to make a compromise on these different issues. Another important point, in relation to the European budget, is of course the question of own resources. I have also noted, with regard to the budget, the strong signals sent by the European Parliament, including on this subject. That means - when we talk about this issue important - that we must look at: for some, it is a question of considering the expansion of the ETS system; for others, it is a matter of leading this debate in relation to digital taxation; for others, it is a question of how plastic waste contributions can be implemented, and other suggestions, as you know, are also mentioned. In terms of procedure, what are the next steps? Clearly, this Council has given me the mandate, as President of the European Council - the Council which has called on the European Commission to continue intensively, actively, bilateral consultations with the Member States - to make progress towards a compromise and to appreciate when we think we are getting closer to a political landing zone, during which we can try to move towards a final decision at the outset of the European Council. I also wished, in close cooperation with the President of the European Parliament, to have the opportunity for exchanges which I would describe as preventive with the European Parliament. A first meeting was held last night with delegations from the European Parliament, in order to take into account the institutional, treaty-based role of the European Parliament in this decision-making process and to express my respect and desire to develop this good cooperation with the European Parliament. We also spoke briefly about the issue of Brexit, briefly because during these two days of the European Council we became aware of the results of this electoral process and we expressed, with great serenity, with great calm, the fact that the European Council is ready to work with the other institutions, under the leadership of Michel Barnier , to whom we reiterated our confidence to continue the negotiation work. Unity, transparency, will be, as was the case yesterday, important keys to ensuring that this negotiation is a success. We, the Commission and the European Council, will follow the process very closely, day after day, week after week. It is certain that the level playing field requirement will be an important compass in the next stages of the negotiation. We also know that there are time constraints and possible procedures to consider around the summer if extensions are to be desired. But it is not our intention today to anticipate this debate. Let us begin first by acting, I hope, as soon as possible, the vote by the British Parliament and the European Parliament, which will also have to vote on the withdrawal agreement, after which we will see, step by step, how this negotiation is carried out in the best interests of Europe, and also by expressing the wish to maintain close cooperation. , very close, with Britain on the various economic, trade, but also security and defence issues, for example. We also had the opportunity to address the issue of this Conference on the Future of Europe. Several have mentioned it in this commemoration session on the Lisbon Treaty, a follow-up that the European Council takes very seriously. And we feel this aspiration of peoples, of citizens to be more mobilized, not to consider that it is in different countries or at the European level to vote once every four years or every five years, and then to be passive spectator of the decisions that concern them. We understand this call for the mobilization of civil society, citizen mobilization, national parliaments, probably, too. I must say, Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, our initial wish of the European Council to be a loyal and willing actor to cooperate in this process with the European Parliament. But of course, by also stating that for the European Council, it is essential, and you understand it well, to keep its capacity for action in the short and medium term on the strategic agenda. We know the strategic agenda in the short to medium term and we want to maintain that ability to move these extremely important issues forward, which must mobilize us. We also had the opportunity to discuss international relations, paying particular attention to the situation in Turkey. We have not had a very broad debate on Turkey in this Council - we will have the opportunity next year to open more strategic debates on the geopolitical and international level - but we have unambiguously reaffirmed our perfect solidarity with Greece and cyprus, given the recent developments you are experiencing. Finally, a word on the 2020 agenda. I also wished to present to the European Council colleagues a proposal for a working method, a proposal for a strategic agenda for next year, to identify the issues we will discuss next year, which correspond to the priorities of the European Council. Climate, as you have understood, will remain a central item on the political agenda of the European Council, in part as part of the process of implementing the European Green Pact. The digital agenda will also be an important theme. In the spring there should be a summit dedicated mainly to him - because, a few years after Tallinn and the broad implementation of the guidelines that were taken there, it is important to say clearly that we also have an ambition: big data, artificial intelligence, the deployment of 5G. On all these subjects, how can we be a useful player, a positive player too, at the start of the European Council? The issue of migration, of course, will also be a topic that will return to the European Council table next year and, of course, also security and defence issues, which are extremely essential. They are, in my view, linked to Europe's ability to speak with a strong voice at the international level, to promote our values, our interests and to ensure that this ability to be a positive forward-looking player, at a time when the world is changing a lot, at a time when benchmarks are being shaken. This ability for Europe to be a factor and an actor of stability, peace and prosperity to promote cooperation, to promote multilateralism, is an extremely important point. In particular, we will have the opportunity to strategically prepare several international meetings at the European Council. We will have next year different important summits with other countries in the world and other regions in the world. First of all, Africa: Africa is, in my opinion, a very important challenge for the future of Europe. I hope it will be possible in the next weeks and months with the European Commission to develop a good strategic partnership, a good preparation in order to deliver concrete results. Another important summit we will have next year is China. We spoke about climate change: this is one of the important topics we have to discuss with this important country, and in this regard we will also have the opportunity to work very hard in order to try to be efficient and to try to deliver more in order to try to get more results and to promote also our common interests regarding our strategic relationships with other actors in the world. Ladies and gentlemen, I conclude these few words by saying this: we are at the beginning of a new institutional cycle. I deeply believe that this institutional cycle that is opening up is an exceptional window of opportunity for the future of the European project. We are a little more than sixty years after the Treaty of Rome, after the founding fathers, after the mobilization of visionary Europeans: Helmut Kohl, François Mitterrand, who dreamed of free movement and the Schengen area, who dreamed of the common currency, the euro, who fought to advance mutual understanding, prosperity and stability. Our political generation - the one you represent in this Parliament, the one that is present at the start of the Commission or in the European Council - our political generation has an appointment with the future of the European project. There are three words that drive me as President of the European Council. Ambition: ambition for European citizens, ambition to carry this optimistic vision, this vision for the future. Confidence: working on a daily basis to strengthen trust between the institutions, trust within the institutions, but above all trust between the European peoples, confidence in our project, confidence in our European values. And then common sense, pragmatism, realism: keep both feet anchored in reality, as close as possible to the expectations of our fellow citizens who have big dreams, who have high hopes. This Assembly, your assembly, is the vibrant heart of the European project, because you represent, through your direct election, the aspirations, dreams, hopes, sometimes even the angers of the European peoples. I extend my hand and hope that together we can play a useful role for the future of the European project.

It was quite an impressive start of the mandate.  Indeed one week ago, we discussed in the Parliament the European Green Deal. The day after I brought the same proposal to the European Council and the Council has endorsed the goal to make our continent climate neutral by 2050. We have explained to the leaders the core of our proposal and that is to transform our continent’s growth strategy. For too long, global growth has been based on predatory ideas. Humanity took away resources from the environment, and in exchange produced waste and pollution. This has to change and I am convinced this can change. With the European Green Deal we aim at a growth model that gives back to our planet more than it takes away from it. In fact, I am convinced that leadership on environmental protection and a sound, a strong industrial base are just two sides of the same coin. To support this kind of clean innovation, of course we will need a far—reaching investment in education, a far—reaching investment in skills development. But this investment in education and skills development has always been at the core of our European social market economy. So I’m convinced that this principle, which I call competitive sustainability, must be our principal for the future of the social market economy in Europe. Honourable members, all Member States have different starting points, and special problems to tackle, and I want to give you some examples.  Poland indeed, as President Michel said, will have to transform large coal mining regions, actually as does eastern Germany. So at the European Council, Poland has asked for more time to have a closer look at our proposal for the Just Transition Fund. I’m very keen on working with the Member States on this, and we have already started discussing how to support people and regions and companies that indeed have a longer way to come. Other Member States have different issues. Portugal for example. Portugal is one of the countries most affected by climate change: loss of coast; hurricanes; floods; horrible forest fires have taken already a very high toll. Last year 60 people lost their lives in the fires. Portugal started its clean transition already in 2005 and has invested significantly since then. It will close its last coal mine already in 2023. It already has a surplus in renewable energies, and together with the Dutch government, Portugal is now working on green hydrogen energy. So the question for Portugal is how to transform and transport its renewable energy through Spain, through France, to the other countries that need this renewable energy. From the Portuguese perspective, the European Green deal is about energy infrastructure, is about inter-connectivities and is about an adaptation to climate change. The third example is in Sweden. Steel companies are working on carbon free steel production. It sounds surreal, but it’s carbon free steel production and they are confident they can get there in a matter of a few years. But for that they need the reassurance that they will not face unfair competition from abroad. They want steel production to be sustainable for the environment and they want to remain competitive on the global steel market, and this is the essence of competitive sustainability. Indeed, many Member States during the Council were asking for the carbon border mechanism. We’re working on it, so that it can protect our businesses, it can protect the environment and respect WTO rules. Honourable Members, we started our work on the European Green Deal five months ago in this very same hemicycle. In the coming weeks and months, we will flesh out our plan. The Council has endorsed the European Green Deal. Your resolution will give it an even greater momentum. The task ahead of us is tremendous, but if we are together as three institutions, we will win that battle. That is a difficult one, a huge task and we have seen last week how much power is behind us if the three institutions work together. Monsieur le Président, Mesdames et Messieurs les députés, nos ambitions européennes ont besoin de ressources adéquates pour se réaliser. C’est là le cœur de notre discussion pour le prochain budget européen. Nous convenons tous que la proposition actuelle est encore loin de cet objectif. La Commission soutiendra pleinement le président du Conseil européen, Charles Michel, dans ses efforts pour dégager un consensus équilibré, équitable et ambitieux. Je voudrais remercier le président du Parlement européen, David Sassoli, d’avoir défendu d’une voix forte, très forte, un budget approprié pendant la réunion du Conseil. Merci beaucoup, David, pour cela. Il est nécessaire d’être cohérent avec nos ambitions et nos engagements. Il y a l’agenda stratégique du Conseil, il y a les orientations politiques de la Commission. Les deux propositions sont fortement congruentes, mais si nous voulons des résultats à la hauteur de nos ambitions, il nous faut des ressources suffisantes. Et si le budget est trop limité, il n’y a qu’une seule solution: il faut discuter de nouvelles ressources propres pour l’Union européenne. Merci, Charles Michel, d’avoir mentionné maintenant l’ETS, l’emissions trading system. Cet ETS grandit, c’est à dire que cela pourrait être une source de nouvelles ressources propres de l’Union européenne. Meine Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Auf dem Eurozonen-Gipfel haben wir über die internationale Rolle des Euro gesprochen. Der Euro ist ein wesentliches Instrument der Souveränität Europas in der Welt, aber wir verkaufen unseren Euro unter Wert. Es liegt an uns – wir haben es in unserer Hand. Wir wollen die gemeinsame Währung. Wir profitieren vom gemeinsamen Markt. Der Euro ist der stärkste Ausdruck der Zusammenarbeit und der Gemeinschaft, den wir haben. Aber wir müssen auch bereit sein, die strukturellen Voraussetzungen für eine gemeinsame Währung zu schaffen, das heißt, aufeinander zuzugehen bei den Themen, die wir reformieren wollen. Die Kapitalmarktunion muss vollendet werden. Unternehmen – und vor allen Dingen kleine und mittlere Unternehmen – müssen endlich überall auf dem gemeinsamen Markt Zugang zu Kapital haben und damit von der grenzüberschreitenden Wertschöpfungskette auch tatsächlich profitieren. Dafür haben wir ja den gemeinsamen Markt. Aber auch die Bankenunion muss vollendet werden. Es muss doch möglich sein, dass wir einen überlappenden Prozess haben, dass einerseits die nationalen Bankenrisiken reduziert werden und andererseits eine gemeinsame Einlagensicherung aufgebaut wird. Wir brauchen doch nicht auf die nächste Krise zu warten, um dann unter Druck endlich die Resilienz unserer Währungs- und Wirtschaftsunion zu festigen.  Auf dem Eurozonen-Gipfel war sehr erfreulich: die Entwicklung des sogenannten BICC (Budgetary Instrument for Convergence and Competitiveness) – long one – macht erhebliche Fortschritte. Die Hauptmerkmale sind vereinbart, die politische Einigung wird jetzt in Rechtsvorschriften umgesetzt. Das Instrument wird die Arbeitsweise der Euro-Gruppe grundlegend verändern. Es wird die Konvergenz über strukturelle Reformen verbessern. Natürlich muss es noch mit ausreichenden Finanzmitteln unterlegt werden. Was jetzt noch fehlt, ist das Stabilisierungsinstrument, und dazu arbeitet die Kommission an SURE, die Abkürzung für Skills Upgrading Reinsurance Element, das ist ein Stabilisierungsmechanismus, der vor allen Dingen bei asymmetrischen, externen Schocks die Stabilisierung herstellen soll, das heißt: Facharbeit schützen, Unternehmen in der Krise schützen – und ich meine, wenn ich von Krise spreche, eine äußere Krise, die kommt – und gleichzeitig die Weiterbildung stärken. Finally, honourable Members, one word on Brexit. With the clear victory of the Conservatives and Boris Johnson, our assumption is now indeed that the Withdrawal Agreement will be ratified by the end of January. And by saying that, if I look around in this hemicycle and I look at our very brave ‘remain’ MEPs, (Mixed reactions) I can only say, I’m sorry. We will miss you. We will miss you. Thank you for your courage. Thank you for having been at our side (Applause) We’ll never miss those who scream and yell. (Applause and shouting) And now, thank God, without you we are constructing our future partnership with the UK. Our new relationship should be as close as possible for the sake of our businesses, for the sake of our students, and of so many Europeans who stretch their lives across the Channel. This relationship will be clearly different from today’s. The UK will be a third country. Council has tasked that to the Commission, to lead the next phase of negotiation, and I want to pay tribute to Michel Barnier, who has earned everyone’s trust through the years. Thank you very much Michel for you dedication. (Applause) The timetable ahead of us is extremely challenging, it will end by December 2020, it leaves us very little time. In case we cannot conclude an agreement by the end of 2020, we will face again a cliff-edge situation and this would clearly harm our interest, but it will impact more the UK than us, as the European Union will continue benefiting from its single market, its customs union, and the 1 700 international agreements we signed with our partners, but it is clearly not in our interest. We will organise these negotiations to make the most out of the short period. On 1 February we will be ready to propose a mandate for the negotiations. The United Kingdom indeed will become a third country. But at the very end – I hope – for the sake of the European people and the sake of the British people, that we will have an unprecedented partnership. This is not the end of something, it is the beginning of new relations between neighbours, and I want us to become good neighbours with our friends in the United Kingdom. Long live Europe.

Mr Charles Michel, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council for his excellent work Welcome to the European Parliament! For the first time in the new role here in this House. We appreciate you as a convinced European, as a bridge builder. Even from your Belgian origin, this is due to the nature of politics, building bridges, coexistence. Therefore welcome and good luck! You need good luck with the tasks that are before you, because the European Council has become increasingly a blocked institution in recent years. Looking at the outcome of the European Council last week, the great success of 2050 – the phase-out of climate gases – is a great success, thank you for that. But in many other areas we again have no results. For example, when it comes to paying the costs of the climate phase-out, we are in the medium-term financial perspective. Has the European Council not had more discussions on this? Only the Finnish Presidency has presented the result. The question was not even discussed. Outside, entrepreneurs, researchers, students, mayors, farmers expect security are waiting, and the European Council does not even discuss the issue of MFF, which is why you will have a great responsibility in this task, which is to create clarity, to initiate debates and also to implement it. Specifically, with regard to the MFF, I would like to inform you that the Finnish Presidency's proposal is a pure provocation for us in the European Parliament. It is not debatable what the Finnish Presidency has put forward on the matter. It does not reflect the necessary investments that we need in the future of Europe. We also hope that we will finally move away from pure percentage discussions and towards the topics, the tasks, the content. That we are talking about issues and not just about figures, and above all, we need to move away from the net and gross contributor debate. If my own country, Germany, gets a proper external border protection in Greece and Italy financed through the European Union, then that is an advantage for Germany, but not a net contributor/gross contributor debate. We must move away from this perspective towards the European way of thinking. Secondly, I would ask you to have the courage to debate in the Council in the future. Over the last five years, we have had questions which have moved us on the subject of rule of law here in the European Parliament. In Poland, in Hungary, in the Czech Republic, in Romania, with the previous government, people took to the streets, had concerns about the future, and these debates, which have driven people around, were unfortunately hardly addressed in the European Council. This week we had the discussion here in the European Parliament on Malta. A journalist has been murdered for doing her job, for investigating the corruption of the state elites. And the Prime Minister has resigned because he has taken responsibility. So we obviously have contacts between politics and organised crime, and a journalist has been murdered for that reason. However, these issues do not play a role in the European Council. They are not discussed, even though they are the most fundamental issues for the European model of life. That is why I ask you to have courage, put these issues on the agenda – Hungary, the Czech Republic, Poland. The Heads of State or Heads of Government of the European Union must have the courage to discuss these issues among themselves. I would also like to tell you, ladies and gentlemen, that we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats now welcome the clarity of Brexit. We now have clear negotiating partners, a strong mandate for Boris Johnson. We can give our blessing in the European Parliament. I would also like to express my thanks to Guy Verhofstadt for his work as Parliament's Brexit negotiator. We can now conclude as a Parliament because our objectives have been implemented and fulfilled in this Treaty, and in the further steps that are now to be taken, it must be made clear that the further partnership is designed for friendship, for cooperation. We all want close cooperation, especially the 50%, about half of the British who want the partnership, are strong in our thoughts. But one thing must be clear: a country outside the European Union cannot have the same standards as someone who is in the European Union. And it must also be clear that anyone who wants access to the market must accept our market rules. This applies to the City of London, and also to agricultural products. Everyone must respect our standards and it will be our benchmark seofto for assessing future outcomes in the talks in which the European Parliament plays a central role. Brexit is a historic mistake, but we now want to implement it in partnership and perhaps also develop it into a model of how we deal with our neighbourhood in the future. Finally, dear Charles Michel, one more request: the penultimate European Council has unfortunately produced a disaster for the Western Balkans. With the cancellation of the opening of negotiations with Northern Macedonia and Albania, there has been a great deal of frustration and disappointment in the region, and therefore the urgent request: if you come back to the European Parliament next time, after the next European Council, we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats have the request that the European Council then give the green light to the enlargement talks with these two countries. We must reach out to the Western Balkans, otherwise there will be more instability there.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 21, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, dear Michel, on behalf of the Social Democratic Group I welcome you to this Parliament and wish you every success, hoping that your Presidency will have strong leadership in meeting Europe's challenges and challenges. It's what we need: strong leadership and being courageous in decision-making. We have a responsibility to reach the commitments made, including each and every discussion held within the Council. If we aspire to build a greener, social and inclusive Europe, we need financial resources that live up to our ambition. And we also need a strong budgetary framework to deal with a possible economic crisis, and to ensure the security of our citizens within the framework of a common foreign and security policy. We welcome the fact that the European Council has agreed in the last conclusions on the objective of achieving climate neutrality by 2050, despite resistance from some Member State. We need to address this issue when we debate the future of the Union: the need to change the rule of unanimity, because only in this way will we be able to meet the challenges ahead. Although the Council's conclusions go in the right direction, the multiannual financial framework was the elephant in the room. The cuts proposed by the Council are totally unacceptable. Our group will prevent this proposal from becoming the budgetary framework that the Union needs for the next period. The Council's current proposal is totally unrealistic: less budget for cohesion, less budget for agriculture, less budget to connect Europe and border management, just to mention some of the headings referred to. The proposal also provides insufficient funding for research policy and for the fulfilment of climate objectives. More seriously, he does not even mention the Fair Transition Fund, the European Green Pact and the Children's Guarantee. I have said it on previous occasions and I repeat it again now: it is impossible to do more with less. If we want no one to be left behind on this path we are embarking on, the Council must bet on a strong budgetary framework. Yes, the Union budget will play a key role, but it will also have to be supplemented by additional own resources and more investment at national level. We therefore call for the incorporation of the golden rule into the Stability and Growth Pact to exclude sustainable investment from European tax rules. This reform would boost green investment and the creation of quality jobs. That is why we need the commitment to include the social pillar in the European Semester not be a mere symbolic exercise. We are committed to incorporating social conditionality to link the Structural Funds with the fulfilment of the social pillar. Mr Michel, if we are to succeed in our mandate, we need empathy and pedagogy. Only by exercising empathy between the Member States and pedagogy before our citizens can we understand the great benefits of having a stronger Union. And I conclude, with regard to Brexit, I will be allowed to use this speech today to convey a clear message of recognition and thanks to the British MEPs who for 46 years have written the history of our European democracy. We were talking about the tenth anniversary of the Lisbon Treaty. Our colleague Richard Corbett was the rapporteur of this Parliament on the report of the Lisbon Treaty. You deserve our respect, you deserve our recognition, you deserve our personal affection too. Be very clear: there is one thing that no one will be able to take away from you, and it is the pride of having been part of the history of the European project.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 22, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Dacian CIOLOŞ", "mepid": "197631", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. Mr President, Madam President, dear Charles, first of all, welcome to the European Parliament and congratulate you on taking office. We are putting a lot of confidence and a lot of hope into the start of this new mandate because we need a real partner in the European Council who brings European themes and topics so that we can move forward. The message from the citizens in the last European elections was very clear. It is now up to us to implement it and I am sure that you, with your vision, your negotiating ability, will bring this new blood, this new wind that we need to be able to move forward together. This first European Council that you chaired brought good news, with the climate commitment by 2050. But we feel that in the Council there are Member States that are still on their positions and that the determination is not yet sufficient to enable us to move forward and implement this objective. It is very good to have objectives, it is already a step forward, but we now need to be able to implement them. And there is an important task for the Commission, which is to come up with proposals. We need to give the courage of the Member States to take this responsibility, to take this step forward, and it is clear that we must turn this climate project into an opportunity and that the Member States - even if they start from different starting points - must seize that this fight against climate change is a real opportunity. For this to be very clear, this must be reflected within the budgetary perspectives of the multi-year financial framework, which must be a real instrument to be able to deliver results on the climate project, but also on digital transformation and all other objectives. On how the multi-year financial framework can be a real European instrument, and not just a negotiation between Member States on the theme 'how much some earn and how many others lose', there is still work to be done. In my opinion, this will be the only way to get a decision on the budgetary outlook: to understand that this multi-year financial framework is in fact an instrument to implement our political ambitions, and not just a place of negotiation and haggling between who wins and who loses. On the budget outlook, in our view, it would be a mistake to look at things from the point of view of the allocation of available resources between conventional, old policies and new priorities, since we need to modernise the traditional policies, namely the Common Agricultural Policy and cohesion policy, so that these two policies can contribute to the achievement of the ambitions we currently have. rather than weakening them. That is where Parliament will go. We also resolutely support a strong European budget, not only thanks to the contribution of the Member States, but also based on own resources, on which we must make very clear progress, because otherwise we will not stop debating the European budget, which is entirely dependent on the Member States engaged in negotiating between who wins and who loses. That is why own resources are a first step towards a real European budget, built around European perspectives and objectives.  One last word on Brexit. We regret the results of the election in the UK - but now, at least, we have more clarity about what will happen, and Parliament will assume its responsibility. But I would also like to use this opportunity to thank our colleagues for their belief in this European project.

So maybe, next year, it would be a good idea if the heads of state went to Glasgow – to the COP26 – to show the importance that they give to the topic of climate protection (if indeed they do). In light of the disappointing outcome of Madrid, it’s good to see that there was an agreement on climate neutrality in 2050 at the summit. This is a very important step, but of course it can only be one step forward: 2050 is quite late, and setting targets is only half the battle. What really matters is less the targets set for later on – they are important sure – but rather the actions you take today in order to achieve those targets. And for those concrete actions, the discussion on the long-term budget – the MFF – is the perfect opportunity, because the EU budget needs to support the climate targets and not undermine them. Right now, the proposals that we have on the table are not doing that job; they don’t match the climate talk. There are still too many harmful subsidies that are being dished out; too little going into the protection of climate and biodiversity.  So I hope Member States will start to walk the walk when it comes to climate and budget. It was disappointing to see that the Polish Government would isolate itself by not agreeing to the target. Let’s not forget that 70% of the Poles themselves are supporting that target, so I really hope the Polish Government will change its my mind: the later you start the transition the harder it will get, and the climate crisis does not stop at any one country’s border.  Brexit is – and remains – a tragedy, but this is not the end. We will never give up on our British friends. We will never forget them, and who knows: one day we might be able to say ‘welcome back, UK; welcome home’.

Mr President, many Belgians – and many Flemings in particular – remember the way Nigel Farage welcomed the previous Belgian President of the Council here and the wording in which he did so. I thank him again for that. There is now a second Belgian President here and I would like to spoil the fun with which you all welcome and applaud him here. You've all listened to Mr. Macron. It, as you know, has jettisoned the Spitzen candidate process and replaced it with candidates whose common characteristic was mainly the knowledge of the French language. He has therefore appointed a French-speaking of Renew as President of the Council. As with the previous President, you have probably all thought: Belgium is a complicated country, let us take the Belgian Prime Minister, that will be a good manager of the European Union. But that too is a mistake. I am here to tell you that Belgium is one of the most lamentable Member States of the European Union. Mr Michel has submitted a budget of 11 billion debt by 2020, a deficit between Greece and Italy. So don't be under the illusion that Belgium is well governed. The citizens of Belgium do not think so, because Belgium has been left in a political chaos that has been going on for more than a year. We celebrated 365 days of the Belgian government crisis yesterday. No one from the Belgian political elite knows where the next Belgian government should come from. We have had elections, which are now being replaced by the analysis that there should actually be new elections. No one knows what needs to be done. Meanwhile, the remnants of the Michel government rule: 38 MPs out of 150. So Belgium is a minority regime that is actually governed in an almost dictatorial way. The only consolation you have is that you have appointed a multilateralist, an almost blindly worshipper of the European Union and of the ever closer Union. Bravo, congratulations. You have also appointed someone who is a staunch supporter of mass immigration. Because he has deliberately dropped his government on the possibility for himself to go to Marrakesh and sign the UN immigration pact there. So, my dear colleagues, speaking as a citizen living in Belgium, I can assure you that your so-called President of the Council is not a unifier, but rather a source and a warning bell of political chaos. We, of the ID Group, are in favour of a European cooperation but firmly against your ever-closer union state.

Indeed, the Conservatives won a historic victory last Thursday. 365 Conservative members of parliament were elected, giving an 80 seat majority over all other parties. Above all, this was a huge vote of confidence in Boris Johnson as Prime Minister and a mandate to get Brexit done. It was also a total rejection of the command socialism being offered by the main opposition party. I hope there will no longer be a willingness in the EU institutions to be taken in by a few people waving blue flags or of past political leaders coming to Brussels to peddle false messages to what became an echo chamber of self-delusion. The United Kingdom and the European Union will move ahead quickly in developing that ambitious, broad, flexible partnership, with a comprehensive free trade agreement at its core and many other areas of cooperation, so that we can together build a new partnership of friends and sovereign equals in tackling the great threats and challenges that affect us all. This is the great project for 2020, fuelled by the warmth expressed by the British Prime Minister for the other nations of Europe, and I thank President von der Leyen for her positive remarks and, indeed, the positive remarks made by a number of other colleagues. It’s in all our interests now to expedite the Withdrawal Agreement. It will be voted on in the House of Commons this week so that we can leave without further difficulty on 31 January.

Mr President, Mr Michel, I welcome you to the European Parliament since it is your first presence here. My group is very different from your policy, but I confess that the harsh attack you are under from the far right here in the European Parliament raises the bar of expectations that we have from you. And I would like to say that the first problem you have to solve is for the Council to stop blocking things that the European Parliament is asking for, things that the times demand and things - some of them at least - that the Commission also supports and which stop in the Council.  I start with a topic that is of great interest to our team, but it concerns me a lot as a Greek. It is not enough, Mr Michel, to condemn the aggression of the Erdoğan regime, which threatens peace and stability in the Mediterranean and the Aegean, which threatens Cyprus and Greece and which threatens to set fire to a sensitive area. It's not enough to verbally condemn! Sanctions are required. The Council decided to impose sanctions in June and October, but must activate them. So I would like you to tell me why you are not triggering these sanctions. Secondly, in order to achieve the objectives that you and Mrs von der Leyen have presented, on climate change, on social cohesion, on agricultural policy, on technological renewal, money is needed. And the European Parliament, by a large majority, has come up with a proposal that says that, in order to achieve these objectives, we need at least 1.3% of European GDP. My group would like more ambitious targets for the Social Agenda, for the climate, but at least. That is what the European Parliament is proposing by a large majority. So, what's going on? The Council, through the Finnish Presidency, is coming and proposes, in relation to the Proposals of the European Parliament, 13% cuts in regional development and cohesion, 27% in investment for people and social cohesion, 25% for LIFE, for climate, 30% in the Horizon programme, 48% in the Erasmus programme, 35% in the Connecting Europe programme. At the same time, if we compare your proposals for the new multiannual budget with the previous one, you propose a 132% increase for migration and border management and 650% for militarisation, defence and security. Which citizen can you convince with this policy? How long are you going to delay and postpone what's needed? Otherwise, all the fine things that have been said, both by Mrs von der Leyen and by you, on climate-neutral policy, on the social agenda, on farmers, on social cohesion, will remain words.

The EU has prepared extensively for the task ahead, and we are looking forward to constructive negotiations, as we want to conclude an ambitious agreement. Our mandate for the negotiations will be based on the political declarations jointly agreed between the EU and the UK, and I hope that, with this declaration, we will be taken to the most unprecedentedly deep and diversified agreement we ever had with a third country, hopefully allowing us to tackle global challenges together while respecting European level-playing-field measures and the interests of the Union.

It is, however, a double victory for Boris Johnson with these results in the general election. First, a democratic victory. He enforced the 2016 referendum, enforced the choice of the sovereign people, completed the negotiations and formalised Britain's effective exit from the European Union. But it is also, of course, a political victory. He brought the people together, he gave his political family his greatest electoral success in more than thirty years and he freed himself from the great dogmas: migratory laxity or globalism as an inexhaustible horizon.

Thank you very much for your willingness to cooperate, which will certainly be difficult cooperation.  Secondly, I would also like to express my satisfaction that the Council did not close the negotiating door after seeing the Finnish Presidency negobox, because this may be a starting point, but it is certainly not the base for further work in the way the Finnish Presidency has indicated.

Madam President, Mr President of the European Council, at the request of Ursula von der Leyen, our President, and as many of you have, of course, raised the issue of Brexit, I would like to say a few words on this subject, in response to your speeches. First of all, I would like to point out, as do many of you, that this is the very first time that our Parliament has debated Brexit knowing that it will really take place on 31 January, from now on. I say this with a lot of respect, and also a lot of understanding. I echo the speech of Iratxe Garcia Pérez, Dacian Ciolo and Ska Keller too, from many of you - a great deal of understanding towards all those, many of you here and outside this Chamber, who would have liked the United Kingdom to remain in the Union. But I also express respect for the British choice, from the beginning, and our responsibility, ladies and gentlemen, our mission, the one entrusted to me, is precisely to respect the will expressed by a majority of British citizens, and therefore to organise the orderly withdrawal in the interest of the citizens, in the interest of the economy, on both sides, and in the interest of the future as well. , through a treaty that is now here, which you know well since we have somehow co-constructed it together. I in turn want to thank the Brexit steering group and all the parliamentarians who participated, in particular Guy Verhofstadt. Now we are on the verge of looking to the future and I remember what our President Ursula von der Leyen said here on 27 November: \"Whatever our future, the bonds and friendship between our peoples will remain indestructible\". That is the line, ladies and gentlemen, for the times ahead, and that is what will lead us to work respectfully, ambitiously on a very strong and strategic relationship with the United Kingdom. This relationship will be based on an economic pillar, and we will work in particular with Commissioner Phil Hogan and all the other Commissioners concerned, under the authority of the Chair, and a strategic pillar, to which we will work with High Representative Josep Borrell and other Commissioners as a matter of priority. The United Kingdom will remain, as you said, a friendly country, an allied country, a partner country and we must translate this alliance, this friendship, this partnership into new treaties. I would like to point out that the framework for this future relationship, which is very ambitious, is written very precisely in the last 36 pages of this document that you have before you. And I want to remind you that this document, this political statement, is common. Every word counts, every word has been approved by us and by Boris Johnson. Again, every word counts. What can limit this ambition, ladies and gentlemen? Two things. The first is the time, the time we need to translate this ambition into treaties or texts. The second thing: of course, the differences that may arise between our interests and our objectives, in particular the answer that the United Kingdom will bring, in the coming weeks, to a question. The UK is leaving the EU, we respect that choice. He is not leaving Europe, of course. Does it want to move away, and to what extent, from our regulatory model? That is the question that is being asked. It is the response that will be given by the United Kingdom that will determine the level of our ambition. As of today, we have three projects to do together. The first is the conclusion of the ratification process for the withdrawal agreement. The second is the implementation of the agreement itself, in all its dimensions. This is not insignificant, both for the citizens whose rights written in this text must be respected, and also, I would like to remind you, Madam President - I also say this to Mr Kelleher and Sean Kelly and others - in Ireland and Northern Ireland, for peace and stability. The third project is that of the future, of the new negotiation, in a limited time. We have heard the British Prime Minister say that he will not want to ask for an extension of the transition. This extension is possible, it will remain possible until 30 June, by mutual agreement, which means that each of the two partners, the Union and the United Kingdom can say yes, or not, until 30 June. This time is limited, so it will not be possible, if I continue to be very frank with you, in this limited time, to do everything, but we will do everything we can. We can't do it all, but we will give it our all. So, of course, if we want to reach, at the end of the road, a new relationship in all its dimensions, it will take more time and continue beyond the end of the transition, at the end of 2020, to work with the British and negotiate. I want to make a final commitment under the authority of President von der Leyen and with the confidence of the President of the European Council, and yours. We will continue to work with the same method: transparency, frankness, dialogue with all the Commissioners concerned and with the Commission's services. I would just like to say one last word to Mr Michael Heaver, who spoke very vehemently earlier and said, ''We are proud to be British.'' Of course, we respect and understand this pride, but, Mr. Heaver, we are all here proud to be patriots, and we have no lesson in patriotism from you. (Applause) The only thing I want to say is that, to our patriotism, to our pride in being patriots, we add here an extra dimension, we think that our patriotism is today, and will be tomorrow in the world as it comes, stronger, because we add the union of Europeans and the common action of europeans.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 68, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Charles Michel", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President of the European Council. Madam President, Madam President, dear Members of the European Parliament, thank you for the various messages that have been sent, for the opinions that have been expressed. The first point is that the climate was indeed the number one issue for this European summit last week. Thank you for the encouragement that has been expressed; I can see how much work remains to be done, and in particular the need, very quickly, to agree on the 2030 targets in order to prepare for the next COP, particularly in Glasgow. We will do so with the Commission, taking into account the assessments necessary to continue progress on this subject. Second element: yes, this is an important step that was taken last week by the European Council, because the decision is unanimous on the 2050 climate neutrality target, and it is only for its implementation that a European country has considered that more time is needed - we will come back specifically to this subject in June , in the European Council. Third, we opened the financing project because, in fact, to be credible and realistic, this issue of funding is essential. We will continue it in the coming months, in particular, but not only in view of the debate on the next European budget. And finally, a complementary point, which several have mentioned: I also believe that this strong position, carried by the European authorities - the European Green Pact, climate neutrality in 2050 - gives the European authorities and the institutions a clear mandate at the international level, especially in the context of next year's summits with China. Moving this agenda forward at the international level is also part of success, and I deeply believe that this decision is really essential, because it creates the conditions for putting Europe in a position tomorrow to have champions for the green economy, which is a good thing for prosperity, for stability, for development and for innovation as well. Finally, look at the progress I've come in a few months, no matter how impatient, I respect and hear. Just a few months ago, at the Sibiu Summit , at the beginning of 2019, only 9 out of 27 European countries shared this climate neutrality target by 2050. A few months later, there is unanimity around this extremely strong message. The second point is the question of the European budget. I share the view expressed in particular by Mr Weber and other Members of the European Parliament: this is an extremely difficult task. That is why, well before last week's summit, I took a long time, Mr MEP, to meet one-on-one with the various European leaders, to understand priorities, to understand the negotiating spaces and the spaces for compromise. But I also count on the political coherence of all politicians, because I mean here a line of strength that emerges and ambitions that are legitimate in terms of capacity to act through the European budget. At the same time, I also see all around the table of European leaders, heads of state and prime ministers, each of whom faces national parliaments composed of political majorities, with parties represented in this European Parliament. I also count on an ability in the future to bring the debate to a political coherence, whether it is addressed to interlocutors at the national level or at the European level, so that the same messages are carried by the political parties from which you presented yourself before the voters. Finally, third element: I do not want to avoid the question of Malta and the rule of law. I will be very clear on this extremely important subject. The rule of law is a foundation, is a founding value of the European project. And the murder of a journalist is obviously first of all a tragedy for the families, is a tragedy for the relatives, a human drama. But, beyond this human and personal tragedy for families, this is a serious and serious attack on press freedom, it is one of the fundamentals of this European project that unites us and brings us together. Investigations are ongoing, which must be based on the principles of the rule of law, on the principles of the separation of powers. It is up to the European institutions, each in its role and responsibility - the European Parliament has already started a number of reflections and reasoning on the subject - to assume their responsibilities. I will not try to escape my responsibilities when it comes to defending the rule of law, and it is in this spirit also that I have announced that I am prepared to to meet the family of this murdered journalist. (Applause) Finally, one more word on Brexit: I would like to repeat, say here again that each time - and this started with the referendum, three years ago - I respected the positions expressed by the British people in the referendum. I regret this decision, but I respect it, because it was expressed by the British people. The European Council last week - and Michel Barnier has just said it again with great precision - has put itself in order for the next steps. We know what direction we want, we know where we want to go, we know that transparency and unity will be essential to ensure that these negotiations are fair and respectful. We will protect, defend European interests, the level playing field, the interest also to preserve the integrity of the internal market. But I would like, with great tranquillity, with great calm - it will always be my spirit: the gathering - to say to those I have heard in this House who, once again, have practiced the annoying insult and insult rather than the argument, to tell them that I will not let myself be intimidated by this spirit of sterile controversy. With calm and determination, we will defend a strong, close relationship for the future with Great Britain. Finally, I will conclude with these few words, reiterating my conviction. Ambition, trust and common sense are, in my opinion, the guidelines that must dominate the action of the institutions, without ever forgetting that each institution is there to carry the hopes and dreams of European citizens and to ensure that this project that mobilizes us is a project that brings light for the future.

At least now, the British Prime Minister's position has been that there will be no desire to extend the transition period after that. So next year will be a very heated period of negotiations, and I wish our excellent chief negotiator Michel Barnier, who has a big job ahead of him. Personally, I think it is important that we reach an agreement, which would create as few obstacles as possible to the movement of people, goods and services. I think it is important that our cooperation continues closely, particularly in the areas of education, research and security cooperation.

Before I go any further, I would like to invite you to watch a short video about this year's winner, Dr. Ilham Tohti. (A video is screened) Ladies and gentlemen, today we are awarding the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to Professor Ilham Tohti, who cannot be here with us and has been in prison since 2014. His struggle, for which he is still paying a heavy price, must be a source of inspiration for us. I would like to express my sincere thanks to your daughter, Mrs Jewher Ilham, who had the courage to come here on her behalf.  It is here, in the very heart of European democracy, that we can hear, but above all listen, the voice of those who cannot do so in their own countries.  By awarding the Sakharov Prize, this Parliament must speak up for freedom of thought and speech, an extremely valuable freedom, for many and too many who are still dangerous.  I am particularly proud and honoured to be able to award this award to Professor Ilham.  His struggle highlights the values of dialogue, mutual understanding, moderation, reconciliation and cultural diversity. It is those same values that under which the European project is based.  Ilham Tohti is a professor of economics, but he is also a voice that invites us all to moderation and reconciliation. He has committed himself to defending the rights of the Uyghur minority in China, with the hope of improving their living conditions. Uyghurs are constantly being persecuted in all kinds: physical, cultural, religious, economic and political.  Since April 2017, more than a million innocent Uyghurs have been arbitrarily detained in a network of prison camps, where they are forced to renounce their ethnic identity and religious beliefs.  However, these people are a great people, with a deep identity, and with a history of over 1,000 during which they have been able to develop a culture that deserves to be preserved. Ilham Tohti, through his militant activities, managed to give them a voice. Although he is being held in prison, his voice resonates today with that of his daughter and many other Uyghurs. For over twenty years he has been working tirelessly to promote dialogue and mutual understanding between Uyghurs and other Chinese peoples. Nevertheless, he was sentenced to life in prison on charges of 'separatism'.  The European Parliament calls for his immediate and unconditional release.  His struggle and all the suffering he has suffered remind us that we must fight for freedom of thought. It is a fundamental right that is sometimes won at the cost of human lives.  I would also like to mention, of course, with all of you, the winners of the previous editions of the prize, who are currently in prison and persecuted for defending human rights and fundamental freedoms, and sometimes even for the simple fact that they have won the Sakharov Prize: Nasrin Sotoudeh, Raif Badaw, the 'Damas de Blanco', various members of the democratic opposition in Venezuela and Asmaa Mahfouz.  Therefore, this Parliament urges the High Representative to take all necessary measures, in his contacts with the countries concerned, to secure the release and cessation of persecution of the Sakharov Prize winners. This request is extended to the Member States of the European Union and to our governments, within the framework of their bilateral relations, seek to convey the common values of the European Union and to defend human rights and freedoms. Today should be a day of celebration to celebrate freedom of thought and instead it is a sad day. Once again this chair is empty, because in the world in which we live being free to think does not always mean being truly free.   In the hope that Ilham Tothi will be released, that he will come and visit us, we turn our thoughts to him, his family members and all those who are unfortunately in prison with him.

I want to thank the European Parliament and all those who made it possible for my father to receive the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought. You have highlighted not only my father’s work and the persecution he has endured because of it, but you bring to the attention of the European Union and the rest of the world the plight of over one million Uyghurs who have been forcibly detained in concentration camps in the Uyghur Region. Thank you. Rehmet. It is an honour to be at the European Parliament today to accept the Sakharov Prize on behalf of my father. I am grateful for the opportunity to tell his story, because he cannot tell it himself. To be honest with you, I don’t know where my father is. 2017 was the last time my family received word about him. At that time, he was being held in Urumqi first prison. I have not seen my father since we were separated at the Beijing airport in 2013 – we were on our way to Indiana University, where my father was invited as a visiting scholar. Unfortunately, he never made it to the US. On that day, we were pulled out of the security line. I was given the choice of boarding the plane and flying to the US, or staying with my father. My father insisted that I continue. He said to me, ‘Don’t cry, don’t let them think Uyghur girls are weak.’ I went, and because of his encouragement, I am here in Strasbourg with all of you. But while I travelled on, he was detained, beaten, questioned, and now carries a life sentence at some undisclosed location. I will never be able to travel back to China and will likely never meet my family again. It is hard to believe that my father still physically resembles now the man I knew as a child. The man who worked at my bedroom desk in pyjamas after I complained he spent more time on his website ‘Uyghur Biz’ than with me. When there was a problem, my father always had a solution. He believed that when there was a problem, you need to fix it, just like when there is a hole in a fabric, you need to sew it. An unresolved problem, he thought, will lead to a bigger problem. And so, he moved his laptop into my room and he worked at my desk while I sat on my bed doing homework. This way, we could be together. Sometimes, he would forget how late it was, lost in his work until 4 in the morning. I would go in and out of sleep to the click of his fingers on the computer. I was a teenager then, with little understanding of why my father would give up his profitable business career and our trips to the Nujie halal meat market for the life that landed him in prison. There was a time when we could afford to buy a whole halal lamb or an entire sheep and share it with the neighbourhood. After my father committed himself to advocating for the rights of Uyghurs, halal lamb grew more scarce in our household. My father’s wealth went to supporting the Uyghur community – from poor Uyghur mothers to homeless children. When he purchased a server in the United States to secure his website ‘Uyghur Biz’, there was no money left for lamb. My father was not afraid of being poor as long as he could devote himself to the cause that came to define his life: fostering peaceful dialogue and understanding between the Han Chinese and the Uyghurs living in the western part of China. For him, the problem was clear. Uyghurs were being denied basic rights: the right to believe what we believe; the right to worship the way we want to worship; the right to think what we want to think. For him, the solution was simple: to engage with the Chinese Government in conversation about working with Uyghur people in a peaceful, non-violent and instructive way. The Chinese Government was not interested in conversations about working on the tensions building in the Uyghur region with a Uyghur scholar like my father – a man who was committed to peaceful resolution where the Han and the Uyghurs could live in harmony. Instead, they labelled him a separatist and locked him in solitary confinement for empowering the very people the Chinese Government wanted to control. Today, there is no freedom for Uyghurs in China – you know this – not at school, not in public, not even in private homes. My father, like most Uyghurs, has been labelled a violent extremist, with a diseases that needs to be cured and a mind that need to be washed. It is under this false label of extremism that the Government has put one million people – probably even more – into concentration camps, where Uyghurs are forced to give up their religion, language and culture, where forced labour is widespread and people are tortured. Some have died. History repeats itself. It didn’t end well before; it won’t end well now. China labels them as ‘re-education centres’. Sorry, but I don’t buy this term, and you shouldn’t either. ‘Extremism’ is the kind of language the Chinese Government uses to justify tearing families apart, controlling and monitoring every move of the Uyghurs inside and outside of China, and putting so many innocent people into camps. Even in my home in Washington DC, my phone and computer are often hacked. People ask me, am I scared? Yes, I am afraid. Sometimes I wake up in a cold sweat. Sometimes I worry that my speaking out will bring harm to my family living in China. Even speaking to you today makes me nervous. I’m sure my father was afraid, too. But when he identified a problem, he overcame his fear by working towards a solution, no matter what the cost. I’m here today because I want to support my father. So I ask you in this room and those who are listening: do you see a problem with the way the Chinese Government is treating Uyghur people? If you see a problem, please work towards a solution. Work from your place of influence. To the Members of Parliament: use your laws to hold Chinese Government officials accountable. To businesses: don’t be complicit in the Chinese Government’s persecution of the Uyghur people. To the scholars: continue your research to help expose these atrocities. To the NGOs: keep up the good work and hang in there. (Applause) To students: educate yourselves and never stop your pursuit of the truth and your fight for justice. This is not about fighting China. This is about protecting human rights. A special mention goes to my father’s students who are serving years in prison for supporting him and his projects. These brave people, as well as my Uyghur brothers and sisters, are not alone in the camps. Kazakh, Kyrgyz, Uzbek people are jailed in concentration camps simply for being themselves. Human rights lawyers and human rights defenders are held in prison simply for protecting the rights of other human beings. Elsewhere in China, Tibetans and Hong Kongers, the Chinese Christians continue to struggle to protect their identity and their basic human rights. In the spirit of my father’s work to promote a world of respect and understanding among different communities, I would like to bring to your attention the other finalists. Although they have not received the Prize, their dedication and work deserve equal attention. Therefore, I ask you to discover more about The Restorers, who are doing amazing work in improving the lives of women in Kenya and elsewhere in Africa. In Brazil, the causes of the late Marielle Franco, Chief Raoni and Ms Silva dos Santos must be supported for their tireless work on preserving the Amazon rainforest and the rights of marginalised indigenous people who live in the region. (Applause) These incredible people need to be heard. These people need your immediate support. Finally, while I don’t know where my father is, I believe he is alive. I believe that his spirit, as captured in the Sakharov Prize, honours the father I know who moved his computer into my bedroom when I needed him. Now, the Uyghur people need you. Thank you very much.

Ms O’Reilly, it is a very impressive sign of trust and confidence of the European Parliament and a recognition of your excellent work over the last number of years. The Ombudsman has become a very important pillar of the EU’s institutional architecture since its first election in 1995, and the Ombudsman’s role as a facilitator and a mediator for the citizens and the administration deserves all our full support. We have been working together in the Commission over recent years to make the EU administration better, more transparent and more efficient. Actually too few people realise this, but only 5% of the cases end up with a finding of maladministration, and in more than 70% of the cases the Commission follows the proposals of the Ombudsman. This shows a constructive spirit and a constructive relationship of the institutions with the Ombudsman in the day—to—day work. The Commission will continue to be a constructive partner with an open mind and, as before, we will deal with your proposals for solutions, suggestions for improvements and recommendations in a constructive spirit and with the shared objective of finding solutions that match the citizens’ and the public interest. The Ombudsman and the Commission have a common interest in getting the message across that the European Union and the institutions care about people’s needs and problems and do everything we can to address these problems in a concrete way. So Ms O’Reilly, once again, let me wish you all the best in your new mandate, and the Commission and I personally look forward to our future cooperation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 84, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Thank you to the Commissioner and, of course, good luck to the new European Ombudsman.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 85, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Karen MELCHIOR", "mepid": "197567", "text": "   – Mr President, did we not miss a vote on the original text to recital P by roll call?

The Green Pact cannot be a relabellization of a status quo, it can't be just a little bit more, just a little better, it can't be the same reassigned or re-labeled budget. We need profound transformations; We need breaks. Today, we need public investment of 1% of European GDP each year. We have saved the banks, we can save the climate, we can save the living, especially if it creates jobs and boosts the European economy. So if the green pact is to save the climate, it is to save the living, it is to revitalize our economy, it is to create jobs, at that time, the agreement with Mercosur cannot be signed. The agreement with Mercosur should not even be considered, as we all know, we have discussed it. Deforestation in Brazil has been doubled this year with Bolsonaro. We know how much this president attacks human rights every day, whether it is women, the freedoms of activists, indigenous peoples or homosexuals. We cannot, in the name of the values of Europe, in the name of climate, in the name of the living, go towards this agreement. The agreement with Mercosur, if summed up in broad strokes, is to export German cars to import beef and soybeans. This cannot be the Europe of the Green Pact, because this Europe is a Europe that contributes to the globalisation of junk food, the globalisation of animal suffering, the globalisation of deforestation, the globalisation of climate change and the globalisation of the disappearance of peasants in the mercosur countries as in Europe. As we know, our agricultural model depends on imports of plant protein. Each year, the equivalent of Germany's surface area is imported in plant protein. We must therefore not simply stop this negotiation with Mercosur, we must review our common agricultural policy and the version, the proposal that you, as Commissioner for Agriculture, Mr Hogan, cannot correspond to the Green Pact for Europe. More intensive livestock farming, fewer farmers, more concentration and pesticides, this cannot be the impact of a Europe of the Green Pact. Let's change the CAP and change our trade policy; it's necessary. The Green Pact can be this great opportunity for Europe. Mrs von der Leyen this morning said: 'We must listen to the european citizens, listen to them, they do not want Mercosur, they want us to act with ambition and concrete actions on climate, biodiversity and democracy'.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 135, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, the topical debate proposed is one of great relevance, as it comes only a week after the presentation by the Commission of its proposal for a European Green Deal.  There can be no doubt that we face immense climate and environmental challenges. Europe needs to play its part in responding to these. If we do not, generations to come will question why we did not act decisively. The status quo is not an option. The EU needs to take the lead and work collectively to transform our economy and societies in order to put them on a more sustainable path.  I will leave it to the Commission to describe its policy proposals in more detail. The Council has not had time to discuss them, and it would be premature for me to take a position at this early stage. I can only say that the Council will engage constructively in examining the proposed policies and measures needed to achieve the European Green Deal. The Green Deal strategy cuts across almost every policy sector and will require careful consideration and coordination.  Against this background, I would like to focus my comments today on the Mercosur Trade Agreement. I’m sure that many Members of this House feel very strongly about the trade deal reached with Mercosur. I know that you have discussed it – for instance, recently, following the forest fires which have been ravaging the Amazon region. This is, indeed, deeply worrying for us all.  Just like here in the European Parliament, the discussion in the Council on the EU—Mercosur Agreement is still at an early stage. It is clear that sufficient time will be needed for a comprehensive examination of the negotiated agreement. Concerns that the trade agreement with Mercosur should be sustainable, also from the point of view of our green agenda, are fully understandable. What trade agreements can contribute to this objective is to export EU standards and sustainability goals to third countries. They can be a vehicle to convince others to implement ambitious environmental and climate policies and form part of a global response to climate change. Millions of jobs in the EU, as well as people’s livelihoods, depend on trade. We need to make sure that trade can take place, whilst ensuring that it supports sustainable development and the EU’s climate goals and contributes to a sustainable future.  I would like to recall that the Mercosur Agreement contains a robust trade and sustainable development chapter. This lives up to the highest standards, comparable to those in other modern agreements, such as the Free Trade Agreement with Japan or the trade part of the modernised Global Agreement with Mexico. The Mercosur Agreement contains a specific article on climate change, committing the parties to effectively implement the Paris Agreement. There were also commitments on fighting deforestation. Private—sector initiatives strengthened these commitments, for example not to source meat from farms in recently deforested areas.  The trade and sustainable development chapter includes commitments regarding the sustainable management of forests. It safeguards relevant initiatives on sustainable agriculture. This includes EU private—sector actions on zero—deforestation supply chains and producer—led initiatives, such as the soy moratorium in Brazil to limit the expansion of soy plantations in forest land. The trade and sustainable development chapter also includes thematic articles on trade—related aspects of natural resources, such as biodiversity, forests and fisheries, including combating illegal logging. The agreement provides a platform to actively engage with Mercosur countries on sustainable development issues. The agreement lists a number of areas of potential cooperation with a view to ensuring that trade supports the sustainability agenda. It also offers civil society organisations an active role to overview the implementation of the agreement, including any environmental concerns.  Finally, the trade and sustainable development chapter is fully legally binding and enforceable. It is subject to a specific dispute settlement procedure, under which a complaint concerning non—compliance is first considered in formal government consultations. If the situation is not resolved, then an independent panel of experts can be requested to examine the matter and make recommendations. The report and recommendations must be made public so that they can be followed up by stakeholders, as well as by the relevant institutions of the parties. I know that many of you will strive for a stronger enforcement mechanism – even with sanctions. This matter has been discussed in the Parliament as well as in the Council. On this basis, the Commission unveiled a 15—point plan to make the EU sustainable development chapters more robust and effective. As shown in the bilateral dispute settlement case of Korea, these are not just empty words. What was obtained from Mercosur in terms of environmental and sustainability commitments is the outcome of very long and arduous negotiations. These commitments are a challenge for the Mercosur countries, but one they are ready to assume. We can be confident that an agreement with Mercosur that contributes to sustainable trade with the region, including a binding commitment by the Mercosur countries to implement the Paris climate deal, will provide the EU with the necessary leverage to pursue our ambitious climate and sustainability goals. The recent forest fires in the Amazon are representative of the sustainability challenges facing Mercosur, but I am convinced that it is only through working with Mercosur that we can get the change and global transformation we so much want to see.

The European Green Deal, which President von der Leyen presented to this House last week, is, as she said, the EU’s new growth strategy. It’s an opportunity to improve the health and wellbeing of our people and our planet by transforming our economic model. It sets out an ambitious roadmap for the EU to become climate neutral by 2050, cutting emissions, restoring the health of our natural environment, protecting our wildlife, creating new economic opportunities and improving the quality of life of our people. This will require important changes to our economy, our energy mix, our industrial processes, our production and consumption, and it is clear that our trade policy will have to play its part. We will ensure this is done at the multilateral, bilateral and unilateral level, coherent with our existing international agreements in the WTO and in our bilateral agreements, such as the EU-Mercosur Association Agreement. I believe that this agreement can contribute to achieving the goals of the Green Deal in a number of ways, and I say this as somebody who has been involved in the negotiations. As is the case with the recent EU trade agreements, it will include a ‘trade and sustainable development’ chapter. This chapter includes a legally-binding commitment to effectively implementing the Paris Agreement. This means that we will be able to engage with Brazil, as well as with the other Mercosur countries, on what they have pledged to achieve by 2030 under the Paris Agreement. That was not the case before the agreement was signed. This covers pledges from Brazil to achieve zero illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, to restore and reforest 12 million hectares of forests, and to curb illegal and unsustainable forest practices. This is what is in the agreement. The trade and sustainability chapter (TSD) also addresses issues such as biodiversity, circular economy, waste management and responsible business conduct in supply chains. All of these are important areas and important aspects of the Green Deal. The TSD chapter recognises the right of both sides to take measures and base legislation on the precautionary principle. This is the first time that this has been explicitly stated in an agreement with a major agricultural exporting block. The agreement will therefore help keep our consumers healthy, but it also will safeguard our high environmental and food-safety standards. The ‘political and cooperation’ part of the agreement foresees cooperation based on the UN Framework Convention on climate change and the Paris Agreement. In order to work together towards the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, you will also find in this part of the agreement provisions for dialogue and cooperation on issues such as oceans, seas and energy. This gives us the tools that the European Union does not possess today in its relationship with the Mercosur countries. The agreement with Mercosur contributes to the Green Deal objectives in other ways as well. Many green goods will be liberalised. It will be easier to provide environmental services. The agreement will help lower the carbon footprint of production in Mercosur. The agreement will encourage green public procurement and sustainable procurement practices. Strong IPR rules and improved enforcement frameworks will facilitate a more extended use of environmental and green technology transfer. Let us also not forget the benefits from enhanced civil society involvement in the implementation of the whole agreement, including the TSD implementation. This allows civil society in third countries to hold their governments to account, just as they do in the European Union. As always, implementation is key, and we need to take a more assertive trade and sustainable stance in our TSD policy, in line with the 15-point action plan for TSD implementation which was agreed in February 2018. I can assure this Parliament that the Commission will remain vigilant in this work and in this task. As you know, the Commission will soon appoint a chief trade enforcement officer. This will be an important new role, not only for market access issues but, equally, for trade and sustainability issues, on which we will all acknowledge there is an important and increasing focus. So my conclusion is clear. The EU-Mercosur agreement not only can, but is an essential part of any agreement internationally to support the Green Deal in many ways.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 137, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Sven SIMON", "mepid": "197426", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The Greens are asking whether the Mercosur agreement is compatible with the Green Deal. The clear answer is yes. What is more, the agreement is even a necessary contribution to the Green Deal, just as Commissioner Hogan said. It is a milestone in legal history because, as Commissioner Hogan has also said, we will have for the first time an enforcement mechanism in a plurilateral trade agreement for the environment and social standards. We will establish a standard that we would not have without the agreement. And that is why the real question is: what if we did not sign the agreement, if we did not agree to it? Of course, trade will then also take place, only without rules, without standards. With this agreement, we are taking the step from unregulated free trade to rules-based fair trade. Do you really want to refuse this progress from the very beginning of the discussion, without knowing the agreement more precisely? We will only have influence in the world if we conclude these agreements. We saw it in the summer: even before it came into force, the agreement had already built up political pressure to fight forest fires in the Amazon, thereby protecting natural areas. You just don't see that! Remember the spectacle you have played in the TTIP and CETA agreements. Even then, you covered us with these horror stories: social dismantling, the erosion of democracy, environmental degradation. None of this has happened. It really would be time for the cheerleaders of these fear campaigns to apologise to European citizens instead of once again stirring up half-truths of sentiment against a new trade agreement. If we want climate protection to go beyond your symbolic policy and declarations of emergency, then we Europeans must not only lead the way, but also ensure that the rest of the world follows our standards.

With the new Green Deal, we want to ensure a future that is more just, more sustainable and completely climate-proof. At the same time, we also had to face an unsuccessful COP in Madrid last week, let’s be honest, and one of the parties that was part of the negotiating team that led to that disappointing result was Brazil. ‘I won’t protect any part of the rainforest that can be exploited.’ Those are Bolsonaro’s words. Could it be any clearer? And let’s be frank at the beginning of this term. It is unthinkable that our farmers, our manufacturers, have to make a huge effort in the new Green Deal and at the same time trade policies will remain as they stand. We cannot open our markets to these countries that – at the same time – try to profit from social and environmental competition and a race to the bottom.

First of all, we want the Brazilians – the Mercosur countries, but Brasilia in particular – to take a different attitude with the international states.

We want to have a change in the policies in Brazil on the Amazon. And last but not least – and I’m looking to the Council in particular, but also to the Commissioner – I want to remind you that we, the Parliament, have a long-standing demand to make the TSD chapters legally much more enforceable, and that includes sanctions, because otherwise the paper on which the TSD chapter is written is useless.

Because this debate is flawed, it is flawed in origin and is only seeking and intending to seek a new enemy. Some needed a new \"Z\". They've already found it: Mercosur. And this is what Mr Jadot has shown, and he has made it very clear.  President von der Leyen said in the presentation of the European Green Pact that trade policy can serve to collaborate with our partners in climate and environmental action, with the Paris Agreement being an essential element of any international agreement.  Well, does this Agreement incorporate these principles? Let's see, do you have a specific chapter dedicated to sustainable development and environmental protection? Yes. Does it include compliance with the Paris Agreement as a binding part of the Agreement? Yes. Have the Mercosur countries ratified the Paris Agreement and committed to implementing it? Yes. So, if so, why so many misgivings, criticisms, fears and apocalyptic visions? Because, ladies and gentlemen, for our climate strategy to have a real global impact, we need partners to join it. And we can only achieve that on the basis of agreements. And this is the most modern of those we have signed to achieve these goals. It will not be with opportunistic or populist demagoguery that we will put out the amazon fires, but with commitment, with cooperation and agreement. Because this agreement goes far beyond the strictly commercial. It is a signed agreement between partners and allies who share democracy as a political system, respect for the rule of law and human rights and who believe in a multilateral system linked to rules. Sister countries that want to not only trade with us, but live as and with us. It is also the first block-by-block agreement signed by Mercosur that consolidates existing trade relations, alleducing them to mutually indispensable common commitments, values that this Agreement recognizes, respects and obliges. And for all this, and although this debate has been driven by those who are always against any treaty – with the support of some who want to divert attention from national problems by lying on climate savonarolas, based their criticisms on disrecognisment, prejudice, fake news or lies – we will study this Agreement, its implications, its real benefits.

I very much welcome this, because it is a response to the Commission not only to the devastating climate and environmental crisis, but also to the tens of thousands of young people who have been taking to the streets every week throughout Europe for the past year.  Commission President von der Leyen herself says that the EU will be climate neutral by 2050. In order to achieve this objective, action is needed in all sectors of the economy. But I now ask you directly, Mr Hogan: how does this clear announcement by Mrs von der Leyen fit in with the current trade policy? Yes, let us take the Mercosur Agreement, which undermines all our climate efforts. Mercosur will lead to more imports of meat, dairy products and ethanol. It will make soya imports even cheaper, and all these products must be grown somewhere. 20% of the entire Amazon has already fallen victim to bulldozers and fires. The rate of deforestation in Brazil doubled last year, so that soya, beef and raw material for ethanol can be grown on this large area. We are looking for an ecological crisis. Soon the rainforest has reached the tipping point, and thus one of the most important ecosystems on earth is on the verge of collapse. The EU promotes this with its trade policy, making a pact with Bolsonaro that tramples on human rights and sabotages the entire climate negotiations in Madrid.  In the Green Deal, the Commission promises to change the agricultural industry in Europe, reduce the use of pesticides and fertilisers and protect The European forest. The Mercosur Agreement is doing the opposite abroad – it is schizophrenic. If we are really serious about the Green Deal, then we also need to change our trade policy. Because, as we know, the trade agreements lay down the economic rules for decades, set them in stone, as in a constitution. Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to take the helm. Now is the time for a different trade policy, for a different agreement with the Mercosur countries. We need sustainable supply chains, and for that the Commission must finally come up with a law. Environmental and social standards must be enforceable and not a toothless tiger, as is the case. Products need to be differentiated according to their carbon footprint and production processes, and we urgently need climate protection to be anchored in all chapters of trade agreements.

So it would have been a historic opportunity for this industry, and the initial announcements from the automotive industry to conclude – or conclude the negotiations – were accordingly positive.  Then not only was a new candidate for the Presidency of the Commission conjured up, but also a Green Deal, which completely calls into question the current production matrix of our economy, and also teasingly garnished with the image of a lunar mission. What do we want to export? Neither in terms of infrastructure nor purchasing power are the countries of Mercosur in a position to use electric vehicles, which are now being pressed into European production lines in accordance with ordre du mufti. South America will continue to depend on the incinerator as the engine of individual locomotion. So exactly the type of drive that the Green Deal is now putting an end to. Let us be clear: our companies, with headquarters and production sites within the EU, may be at the mercy of the political mistakes here – as in other capitals such as Berlin – and our trading partners are certainly not, because they can choose new partners. When in doubt, they look for someone who doesn't drive a new ideological sow through the place for a long time.  That is why the picture of the lunar mission that the President of the Commission painted on the Green Deal is perhaps not so wrong.

The result is disappointing! An outdated, very general mandate from the European Council to the Commission – given in the last millennium without any involvement of the European Parliament – became a free pass for neoliberal free trade. The many new weightings of the sustainability chapters in trade agreements, the priority of human rights, environmental protection and employment standards as prerequisites for economic and social development, which have been won in recent years, are ignored. Just a few days after the disappointing COP 25 in Madrid, we are asking, and rightly so, that the agreement is compatible with the Green Deal announced by the President of the Commission? Does it contribute to the implementation of the UN's 17 Sustainable Development Goals? A very clear no! Just one example – Objective 13: the country with the largest rainforest in the world ignores its responsibilities, just as the Commission and many member governments ignore its responsibilities. The Mercosur Agreement will continue to promote the long-term destruction of the Amazon region in favour of the expansion of agricultural land under the conditions of today's market logic. It thus undermines the Green Deal project to preserve biodiversity. Therefore, it is quite clear that if you, the Commission, want to make climate protection the focus of your work, legally enforceable commitment to environmental and climate protection is part of it.

It would be helpful if you could give us some reassurances as to what impact you think this deal will have on European farmers, whether there will be a reduction in meat production within Europe to satisfy the demands of this trade agreement and whether that is a good or bad arrangement.  This morning we voted on a resolution on how to protect pollinators and indeed restore their status, and one of the things that was dealt with was pesticides, plant protection products and a real push to try and use less, and indeed some colleagues would want to ban everything.

It is true that there is a sustainability chapter calling for the implementation and implementation of the Paris climate agreement, where sustainable forestry is called for and where compliance with the core labour standards of the International Labour Organisation is also required. On the other hand, however, we see that under Bolsonaro there is 60% more illegal clearing of the Amazon forest than before, that 150 pesticides have been re-authorised, which are not permitted in Europe, that the land security of the indigenous population is no longer regulated by law, and above all that two laws have been enacted which clearly contradict ILO standards 98 and 87. , that is, constitute a violation of exactly what was envisaged in the agreement. That is why, in my view, it can only be a matter of really moving three things forward now. The first is that we need a monitoring system. It must be ensured that products from illegally deforested areas cannot enter the European Union. It is not enough for this to be written down without sufficient possibility of verification. Secondly, we must also make the good approaches in the sustainability chapter feasible, concrete steps on how the issue of sustainable forestry should actually be implemented and how to ensure compliance with workers' rights.

In fact, this deal would make the Paris Agreement more effective, not less, because it would anchor our climate commitment in mutually beneficial trade. I agree with the science that very ambitious measures must be taken to save the climate. Living up to the commitments in the Paris Agreement will be totally impossible if we don’t do it together. The free trade agreement between the EU and Mercosur gives us a unique opportunity to cooperate, to put pressure on and create incentives for all partners to take responsibility.

And, furthermore, unequal CAP funding also contributes to the agricultural crisis in many countries, like in my own country – Estonia. And then to add to this the new State religion: climate change. Billions of euros will be spent transforming European society in order to achieve so-called carbon neutrality by 2050, and this while countries such as China and India feel no CO2 shame and happily continue to grow their economies. This new Green Deal will come at a terrible cost to the most valuable and treasured members of our society: those who provide us with food, our farmers.  Apart from the effect the Green Deal will have on the agricultural sector, it will also gravely affect countries relying on fossil fuels for energy supply, and as a result the workers that earn their living in these sectors.  And let’s take again Estonia as an example. My country is largely self-sufficient when it comes to energy supply but relies heavily on its domestic oil shale reserves for this. With a new Green Deal, Estonia will be forced to become reliant on other countries for their energy supply. This will in turn jeopardise the country’s competitiveness, but more importantly, its independence and sovereignty. The alternative to fossil fuels was supposedly to be found in biofuels. However, according to recent findings biofuels are not the solution to hunger, environmental disasters or anything else. In fact they will probably make things worse, and the reason for this is simple – physics. The quantities of biofuels needed to generate the necessary energy supply actually increase greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. To put it plainly, wasting energy to produce energy. Furthermore, the crops and land that could have been used for food supply are instead used to produce energy, and instead of worrying about the compatibility of the EU Mercosur FDA and the European Green Deal, the elected representatives of the European citizens should rather be more concerned about the devastating impact both these initiatives will have on farmers in particular and European citizens in general.

In these countries, pesticides with substances banned in the EU are used and products such as chilled beef and poultry are at the top of the list of food alarms taken in 2018 in Italy. In addition, there are the quotas granted for sugar, rice and, above all, citrus fruits, for which there are fears of plant health problems linked to certain parasites in South America.

The European Union thus proclaims its desire to be exemplary in the implementation of the Paris climate agreements. The intention is laudable, but the reality is very different from the display thus realized. By passing free trade treaties with the whole world, the Union is betraying the environmental objectives it has set itself. The best way to combat air pollution is to promote short circuits to limit the movement of goods over long distances, which requires the massive use of kerosene and heavy fuel oil. However, free trade treaties do exactly the opposite. From this point of view, the free trade agreement with Mercosur is emblematic since it is, by Jean-Claude Juncker's own admission, the largest trade agreement ever concluded by the European Union. With more than 770 million consumers and 18 trillion euros of GDP concerned, it is indeed the largest, and this is all the more serious for the environment as Latin America is a continent far removed from Europe. This new partnership will therefore increase the number of particularly polluting exchanges. Secondly, the content of free trade treaties always sacrifices environmental protection to the almost obsessive concern of exporting our industrial production at all costs. The agreement with Mercosur is no exception to this rule. Certainly, there is a chapter that purports to ensure forest conservation and sustainable development. But, in reality, Brazil is destroying the Amazon rainforest more than ever, which speaks volumes about the effectiveness of this guarantee. In conclusion, true to its ultra-liberal DNA, the European Union is deliberately sacrificing environmental protection to business and the short-term interests of the automotive, chemical, pharmaceutical, telecommunications, transport and financial services lobbies.

It is proposed that the trade agreement with mercosur countries be used to enforce their compliance with the Paris Agreement and to halt amazon deforestation. However, it may also result in an increase in CO2 emissions due to transport. Will the Mercosur agreement allow us to enforce from our partners the level of reduction in the use of pesticides, plant protection products, fertilisers proposed by the new green deal and thus the fulfilment of the animal welfare, food safety and food safety criteria to be met by a French, German or Polish farmer?

The European Green Deal, of course, is the new lens through which so many EU policies will now be seen, and trade policy is certainly, and quite rightly, no different. I was very taken by the lavish praise of the Green Party in relation to the von der Leyen Commission and what she and the Commission are trying to do in relation to the European Green Deal, and I have to wonder why you didn’t vote for the Commission led by Madame von der Leyen in the vote for the entire Commission. But maybe that’s a different story. You don’t seem to be ever satisfied. But can I agree with Ms Jongerius, who said that this deal is an opportunity? And today we do not have any deal whatsoever with the Mercosur countries in order to find a way in which those four countries could embrace a much more progressive opportunity for environment and climate action. Many of the concerns that have been expressed by Members of this House – certainly I don’t know any other mechanism, except to write a letter, or to speak here in Parliament, or to speak in an international forum. But I don’t know any mechanism have we have leverage, except through trade arrangements. I certainly feel that this is an opportunity to bring those four countries on board. Now, I did note that there are certainly many speakers in this House who have not studied the deal, and I respectfully say that we should look at it again, because I want to make a few observations. It is certainly wrong to suggest that the EU-Mercosur deal that we negotiated in 2019 is responsible for the fires in the Amazon. People are trying to convey this message here in various contributions, which is utter nonsense. We totally abhor what President Bolsonaro and his government have done in neglecting their duty in relation to protecting the Amazon. All of us share this objective. But we have to ask ourselves: what is the leverage we have to make sure that this sort of scenario will not happen again? What is the leverage we have with President Bolsonaro to ensure that he and his government protect this great place of nature and protect the Amazon? All of us share this objective. The deal is certainly a deal that’s long-standing in terms of negotiations – over 20 years. But we did, at the end of the day, find a basis where we could have a very balanced outcome in relation to sustainability. President Bolsonaro campaigned in his election to say that he did not want to become part of the Paris Climate Agreement. He was adopting the same policy position as President Trump. He changed his mind in the context of this agreement and has now embraced the Paris Agreement, and we will see what will happen in terms of its implementation. But what this agreement – I want to outline to the people that say there’s no progress made in relation to any issues of sustainability – this agreement includes a binding commitment to the implementation of the Paris Agreement, of which all Mercosur countries are signatories. And Brazil’s nationally-determined contributions under this Paris Agreement include the following pledges, to be achieved by 2030: zero illegal deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon and compensation for greenhouse gas emissions resulting from legal deforestation. Secondly, restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forest for multiple purposes. Thirdly, strengthening the implementation of the forest code. And fourthly, enhancing sustainable management of natural forests with a view to curbing illegal and unsustainable practices. There is a commitment to reforest 12 million hectares by 2030, which amounts to restoring over one million hectares per year, compared to the loss of a half a million hectares of forestry at the moment. So if we don’t have this agreement, how are we going to make sure that we have the binding commitments being implemented? Today we have no forum at all to address these issues, and this, in my view, is progress. The Association Agreement will also provide a solid framework for where we can actually include provisions regarding the promotion of the role of indigenous communities in sustainable supply chains of forestry products or cooperation to promote sustainable social products involving these communities. So it’s not true to say we have neglected the indigenous communities. On social rights, which have been mentioned by some speakers: all Mercosur countries have ratified the eight ILO conventions, except one convention in one country. So three countries have ratified all eight and one country has ratified seven. So to say there is no social progress made in relation to this agreement is, again, wrong. Furthermore, the EU and Mercosur have negotiated a firm agreement to labour standards in the agreement, in order to ensure that trade relationships are not developed at the expense of social or labour rights, but instead, fostering mutual support of this between economic growth, social development and environmental protection. The EU and Mercosur Agreement commits to promoting a decent work agenda, which includes issues such as effective work inspections, ensuring health and safety at work, providing decent working conditions such as regular breaks, or clear contracts or reasonable working hours. So these are just some examples, perhaps, that were not mentioned in the debate that are part of the agreement, and I fundamentally believe that we need to study this carefully. Now, agricultural products, of course, are sensitive products. Beef, sugar and ethanol were particularly sensitive, and that’s why we have tariff rate quotas. And I would remind the House that we have 276 000 tonnes of a beef quota already with the Mercosur countries in the European Union, going back over many years. And this quota is not being filled, because the EU standards have risen in such an extent over the years that the Mercosur countries are not able to meet those standards, and no product comes into the European Union from the Mercosur countries, particularly related to agriculture, unless there’s 100% inspections. And the reason we have a lot of products that are returned to those countries is because our controls are working. We have 100% controls at the moment, and this, in my view, should continue. There will be no diminution of EU standards, and we will protect them. All our geographical indications of this deal are protected, and this is a signal of quality products, as you know in your Member State countries, particularly in France, Italy, Spain and Portugal. I know my good friend Mr Wallace has a slight interest in social and environmental matters, and I welcome his new-found interest in these matters. But I’m glad that I was able to explain to my good friend Mr Wallace what huge advances are being made now in environment and social protections, which I know are a massive concern to you and which you will be able to tell your constituents now of the enormous progress that has been made. Finally, we need some leverage in order to ensure that all of the economic, environmental and social dimensions of our free trade agreements and that our trade is able to be used as leverage. And I was taken by what Madame Kumpula-Natri has mentioned in the course of a contribution. Let’s see in the clarification process and in the legal scrubbing of this deal how we can improve it and give more clarity in relation to the issues of concern to Members of this House. I will work with you to try and ensure that the interpretation of this deal and the clarification that you require at all times will be made available to you in order to improve the prospects of approval of this deal. This House has to consent to this deal before it actually goes to the Member States. Finally, could I say, for 20 years, the European Union has been seeking to negotiate a deal with our friends in Latin America and trying to forge links that have been neglected for many years. We now have an opportunity to say to our friends in South America that our long-forgotten cousins and relatives from Europe, who are now in South America, that we are prepared to work with you on economic, environmental and social matters.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 207, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Tytti Tuppurainen", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Madam President, to conclude, I wish to thank you for this very timely and useful debate on this pressing issue that is a matter of concern to us all. Thank you very much for your valuable remarks. I listened very carefully to your concerns and I will certainly convey them to the Council.  And, dear friends, we all share the view that we need to do our utmost to tackle climate change and environmentally related challenges, which are becoming ever more urgent. The Commission’s European Green Deal proposes a comprehensive strategy which we will now all need to study carefully. This is a welcome initiative and I would like to thank the Commission and Commissioner Hogan for this. Trade forms an important policy area where sustainability is an important element. It serves as a platform to engage with trading partners on climate and on environmental action, and the trade agreement with Mercosur needs to be seen in this light as an opportunity to promote change. I firmly believe that this should be seen as an opportunity to promote change, and this will not happen by itself.  Some of you referred to the possibility of renegotiating a new deal. Now renegotiating the Mercosur trade deal is easier said than done. While the current agreement is not perfect – and of course no agreement ever is – it is economically relevant. It is also of great political and geo-strategic significance that goes way beyond the EU-Mercosur context, and importantly, it represents an opportunity for the EU to export its high social and environmental standards to the region.  The EU cannot reverse deforestation and the impacts of climate change on its own. Working with third countries in a spirit of cooperation and trust is of the utmost importance. This holds true also for trade agreements and in particular as far as the sustainable development chapters are concerned. I believe that trade offers us real leverage, but we need to be prepared to use it and accept that, at the end, this will also involve inevitable trade-offs.

We have done this in multilateral fora, such as the last Human Rights Council in Geneva in September and the United Nations General Assembly in New York in October, and I did recently at my meeting with the Foreign Affairs Minister of China in Madrid. We continue to be gravely concerned about the existence of the so-called ‘political education camps’. Reliable and multiple sources of research indicates that it has almost certainly affected over one million people. Another major source of concern is the use of widespread intrusive surveillance. We understand that advance technologies rely on biometrics, and artificial intelligence is used to monitor and keep files on residents in Xinjiang. This includes the registration of very sensitive biometric data and the widespread use of facial recognition. Credible reports refer to severe limitations to the freedom of conscience and religion, with closure of, or controls imposed on, places of worship, as well as limitations on religious education and education in minority languages. Nobody disputes the right of any country to take legitimate measures to combat terrorism and ensure security, but to our understanding, the policies applied in Xinjiang appear disproportionate to the stated aim of fighting against terrorism and extremism. This was also the conclusion of 12 United Nations special procedure mandate holders who analysed the application of the counterterrorism law in China and came to the conclusion that it raises serious concerns regarding arbitrary detention, enforced disappearances and absence of judicial oversight. I would also like to recall our request to allow meaningful access to the region for independent observers: United Nations special procedure mandate holders and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. So far, these appeals have not been heard. Granting them would be an important step. I’ve been talking with the Chinese authorities in order for our ambassadors to make such a meaningful visit to the region. The award ceremony today will also highlight the importance of respecting the rights of people belonging to minorities to freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and the right to education. The European Union will continue to express its principal position and to raise its concerns regarding Xinjiang in the framework of its political dialogue with China and internationally, including for sure on the United Nations stage. On behalf of the EU, I will continue to call on China to uphold its national and international obligations and to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.

Madam President, it has been 20 years since China signed the international pact on civil and political rights. Since then, the international community has been waiting for China to ratify the pact. While China has made progress in the area of social rights, the situation of civil and political rights has worsened. We say unacceptable the arrests and internments of people who have defended the rights of a community, as is the case for Uighurs in Xinjiang province. The European Parliament cannot remain unreactioned after the revelations of the China Cables, which show how vast and systematic the oppression of the Uighurs is. The European Union cannot remain unresponsive and this reaction cannot be limited to words in aside, even if these are important and indispensable. Having presented the Sakharov Prize to Ilham Tohti today is a strong act that rewards and gives indispensable visibility to a peaceful commitment to the rights of an oppressed community simply for its ethnic identity and religious convictions. The number of Uighurs detained exceeds one million. The information coming to us from these camps in Xinjiang is unworthy of a great nation of the 21st century. The Chinese authorities say the reality is quite different. The presence of these people in the camps would be voluntary, some even going so far as to compare these places to boarding schools. If that were the case, then what prevents China from allowing observers from the international community and journalists to visit these camps? We call on China to give access to these camps and to release those detained for simply expressing the need for an ethnic community or because they live their religious conviction. It is also essential, in my view, that we ensure that products that would be manufactured in these camps are not accessible to the European Union market.

China has so far been one of the most important partners of our Union and a central member of the international community, but this does not mean that we can turn a blind eye to grave human rights violations. About one million Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs are being detained without trial and without charges, often for no other reason than being a Muslim. Earlier today, the European Parliament awarded to Ilham Tohti the 2019 Sakharov Prize. Mr Tohti is a leading Uyghur intellectual, economist and scholar whose only offence was to advocate for peace and the rights of the Uyghurs. He has been sentenced to life imprisonment and could not come to Strasbourg to receive the prize. Today he was represented here by his brave daughter, Jewher, and we call – let it be clear – for the immediate and unconditional release of Ilham Tohti. Xinjiang Province has turned into a major centre of mass surveillance for ethnical, cultural, religious and social control. Every single aspect of daily life is being monitored. Once detained, Uyghurs are forced to give up their religious and cultural identity. This is standard practice in the so—called re—education camps. China has committed itself to the international human rights framework. We have the duty to call on the Chinese government to release all those currently detained, and without any charges. All mass detention camps must be shut and perpetrators of the massive human rights abuses must be brought to justice.

I’m very happy now that he has received the Sakharov Prize this year and that he’s the new Sakharov laureate. But he’s not the only one suffering under the Chinese Government. The Uyghur people have been subjected to unparalleled repression by the Chinese Government in the past two years due to their unique ethnic identity and religious beliefs. Since April 2017 over one million innocent Uyghurs have been arbitrarily detained in a network of internment camps, where they are forced to renounce their ethnic identity and religious beliefs and swear loyalty to the Chinese Government. I am deeply concerned about their situation. The European Union needs to demand that the Chinese authorities respect their fundamental rights and freedoms. We should impose sanctions for human rights violations. The Chinese Government has to immediately end the practice of arbitrary detentions, close all the camps and detention centres, and release the detained persons. Furthermore, we want the Chinese authorities to allow free access to Xinjiang Province Autonomous Region for journalists and international observers. We cannot stand by and have normal business with China while these appalling human rights violations are taking place.

The policy of the Chinese Communist Party towards the Uyghurs has never been liberal, but in 2014 a totalitarian turn was taken in Xinjiang that has created the worst police state that we have on the globe today. This extreme policy is even encountering some internal opposition, as we learn from the China cables, and I think that for a nation of such great cultural tradition as China, it is shameful to implement such policies. Fighting terrorism is necessary, but it’s not an excuse for fighting people who want to think as they want, who want to speak as they want, who want to worship as they want. We strongly believe that it’s time to end the lies, to end the excuses and to end the distractions, and to close the camps. We, as Europeans, must also be active beyond just voicing critical words. That’s why this Parliament calls for the halt of exports and the tech transfer of products and services that are used to enhance cyber surveillance. This is why this Parliament asks that forced labour from internment camps must not be allowed to enter into EU-based companies’ value chains, and as has been said before, the products of forced labour must be banned from the European markets. We call on all EU-based companies to draw clear red lines. They are running a high reputational risks if they don’t implement a robust human rights due diligence system that makes sure that they’re not implicated in acts of repression. We also need a human rights sanctions mechanism, as you have discussed with the foreign ministers in the Foreign Affairs Council, and we need that expeditiously. Let me make a last sentence that alludes to Ilham Tohti, our Sakharov laureate. He is not allowed to see his family. He hasn’t seen his family for two years, even though Chinese law guarantees that.

Social credit mechanisms, facial recognition and even emotion control allow mass surveillance of one and a half billion people.

I think this should be a warning to ourselves as well that these instruments, if they exist, can and will be used. So maybe we should also be a bit more careful. Today we gave the Sakharov Prize to Ilham Tohti as a political signal of where Europe stands. Unfortunately, it is not the first time that we give the Sakharov Prize to freedom fighters in China. So now Europe has to follow up and demand the release of the Uyghur people held in the camps, because that’s what they are. I’ve heard many good suggestions by colleagues on how to proceed, but we also have a new instrument at our disposal and that is the EU—wide Magnitsky Act that was endorsed last week by the Council.

I conclude that the majority, if not to say the unanimity, of this House is strongly concerned with the situation in Xinjiang and calls on China to drastically change its policies in the region including, in particular, the use of political re-education camps and widespread surveillance. The legitimate and necessary global fight against terrorism should happen guaranteeing the respect of human rights and fundamental freedoms. Allow me to express my appreciation for your attention and support in maintaining this important issue high on the EU agenda, and in the international arena also because, let me tell you that China is actively promoting the narrative about successes in combating terrorism in Xinjiang and is obtaining strong support from many countries, including the members of the Organization of the Islamic Conference. Let me give an example. At the United Nations General Assembly, a group of 22 countries, among them several European Member States, released a joint statement on their views about the Uyghur population which was immediately countered by a statement by 54 countries, led by Belarus, praising China’s counter-terrorism activities in the region. So as you can see, worldwide, it is not so clear for the international community. We Europeans are strongly committed on this issue. I think we can say that we are a strong power in the defence of human rights. We have been firmly expressing our concerns about Xinjiang including, as I said, the use of surveillance. We have rules on the export control of dual-base goods and technology, which should allow us to monitor exports in key technologies and check them for security concerns. For sure, we have raised concerns about reports of forced labour since 2018 as part of our annual rights dialogue with China, as well as in bilateral meetings with them. We have told our companies that they have to promote the respect of human rights and the application of corporate social responsibility through the entire supply chain. About sanctions, it’s true that the Americans have been very much active in imposing sanctions on Chinese officials – 28 Chinese Government institutions and companies – for their role in Xinjiang. We haven’t done it; we have a different system. You know that I am trying to improve it by launching the initiative that could allow us to approve something equivalent to the Magnitsky Act. We will inform you about the work we have already started. I need unanimity in the Council in order to do such a thing. I will fight for it. We have to be strong in front but also we have to continue dialogue. Dialogue cannot be forgotten. Both things are perfectly compatible, but I only want you to be sure of the strong engagement that we have on this issue and I count on the support of the European Parliament.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 244, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Ewa KOPACZ", "mepid": "197525", "text": "  I have received five motions for resolutions tabled in accordance with Rule 132(2) of the Rules of Procedure.

The figures are shocking: more than 21% of the population suffer from malnutrition; 25% are surviving on humanitarian assistance. There are many, many figures – most of you know them – that show how big this crisis is; one that has left 70% of children without access to regular education. The shortage of essential medicines, electricity and water supply – even if it has been restored in most parts of Caracas – a large part of the country continues to suffer from regular blackouts.  The EU has been lending humanitarian support. The Commission has established a permanent presence in the country to better monitor the situation. We have provided more than EUR 170 million since 2018 – and around EUR 320 million including Member State assistance – both inside Venezuela and in the neighbouring countries. Around two—thirds of the immediate humanitarian response have been allocated for action inside Venezuela, and we are the biggest humanitarian donor inside the country. The other one—third is implemented in the neighbourhood countries. In view of the limited operation capacities in the Venezuelan context, the International Contact Group has increased its efforts on humanitarian diplomacy in order to further access an operating space for humanitarian actors in the country.  This is the most important population movement in recent American history. Every day, about 5000 Venezuelans leave their country. Five million Venezuelans have already left. More precisely, the number of Venezuelan migrants and refugees in Latin American and Caribbean countries has increased to almost 4 million people right now. The United Nations organisation estimates that this amount can still increase to 4 million, and it could reach 5 million by the end of next year.  I would like to praise the countries in the region for their remarkable efforts in welcoming Venezuelan migrants and refugees, but the overall need to help them is increasing. The United Nations has called for a regional response plan that reflects the growing funding requirements, which will double compared with last year to reach more than USD 1.3 billion.  The numbers are overwhelming and we can see, in some cases, patience wearing thin in some of the countries refusing this big flow of people. We, the European Union – together with our Member States – need to keep the momentum created by the International Solidarity Conference held in Brussels in October. There was not a big answer from the point of view of the resources collected: we have to call for another one in order to bring resources to face this problem.  But, no matter how much we dig into our solidarity coffers, our resources will never be enough to address a crisis of this magnitude. We cannot feed millions of people every day. Venezuela remains a wealthy country, and despite the deep poverty it has thrown its people into, it has one of the largest stock of natural resources. It also has substantive financial assets, many of which are abroad. Surely those could contribute to relieving the suffering of their citizens, because I doubt that the world’s solidarity can bring the amount of money needed to help such a big amount of people on a continuous way.  So, I think we must look for creative solutions to mobilise any kind of resources to address this enormous crisis, and I hope that in the near future we will think about new ideas that we should consider in order to break the current political impasse, and to face this humanitarian crisis as a political issue. On that final point, I’ll be clear: the only real long—lasting solution to the multi-dimensional crisis in Venezuela can be achieved through a peaceful, democratic and Venezuelan-grown process, leading to free and fair presidential elections. But we cannot wait for a political solution to face what is going to be one of the biggest crises from the point of view of migration and from the point of view of the well—being of the people.

It is the departure of this regime and return again to democracy. Dictator Nicolás Maduro's tentacles again seek to annihilate Venezuela's only legitimate power, the National Assembly. In recent hours many parliamentarians have been accused, illegally persecuted, exiled and stripped of their immunity, in order to prevent this Corps and its president, Juan Guaidó, recognized by this Parliament, from continuing the struggle to recapture democracy. It is shameful to see the usurping Government's election to the Human Rights Council at the United Nations, causing the United Nations to become a puppet of torturer tyrants who can delegitimate their mandates, missions and investigations into crimes against humanity, while Ms Bachelet denounces the continuity of these abuses. Total disrespect for the dignity of its people has caused more than 4.5 million people to migrate in recent years. 20% of that country has left its lands in search of a better future: one in five inhabitants. There are an estimated 300,000 Venezuelans in Spain today. This puts this country at the forefront of asylum applications in the European Union.

I would like to say, as has been done here today, to give some figures on what is being lived in Venezuela today. 82% of the population lacks regular access to water, 53% suffer power outages, the country lacks 90% of medicines. Eleven million Venezuelans, eleven, need humanitarian aid. Among them, many outside the country – 80% of those displaced in the region, in Latin America – and 35% of the population as a whole. For this reason, there is talk of a massive, unparalleled exodus in the region, one of the largest on the planet. 4.5 million Venezuelans, of people, with a huge impact – as has been rightly emphasized here – on a long list of countries. I would like to highlight Colombia, but there are others, Ecuador, Peru, Argentina, Chile, who also have to make an enormous effort, when they have a workload, of problems that address very important. We want to call on the international community and the European Union to be able to act and, above all, to provide financial support to a crisis that requires it. The United Nations has valued the needs of Venezuelans at 2 billion, both at home and outside the country. This year, unfortunately, only 25% of that figure has been raised. That is why we call for a political, negotiated and democratic exit for the country. We call, as High Representative Mogherini has done this last autumn, to make visible the reality of Venezuelan refugees and migrants.

L'un aprs l'autre, vous avez évoqué une situation qui est bien connue. Il est évident que nous avons un problame politique, vous n'avez pas ' me convaincre. Mais, personnellement, j'ai un problame de conscience et j'imagine que beaucoup d'entre vous pouvez l'avoir aussi. Parce que, c'est évident, malgré tout ce que nous pouvons dire du régime de Maduro, ce pays est privé de la possibilité de faire valoir ses ressources économiques. Depuis 2017, en raison des sanctions imposées, le Venezuela a été emp'ché d'exporter 400 000 barils par jour de son pétrole, soit l'équivalent de 8 milliards de dollars, quatre fois le montant des importations de nourriture. Et si cela continue, et si le revenu du pétrole tombe encore de 60 % comme cela est prévu, il y aura 300 000 personnes de plus qui ne vont pas avoir accs ' la nourriture, ni aux médicaments. Il faut 'tre aveugle pour ne pas s'en rendre compte. It is named after migrants, from gens qui s'en vont, to une cause: c'est que le pays ne peut pas utiliser ses ressources. This does not excuse political criticism of Maduro's regime at all. This does not excuse anything, but it is clear that, however communist the dictator is, the impact of sanctions cannot be denied, and that the political crisis is joined by a humanitarian crisis, to which we cannot expect to make a solution with the international community charitably providing resources. Because it's not possible to feed tens of millions of people every day. It is not possible to get humanitarian resources for that. The political problem is one, and you have no one to convince me that every effort is needed for elections to take place in Venezuela. I don't need any lessons on that. But we shouldn't deny a reality either. And many of you have said this: solutions must be sought to deal with a gigantic humanitarian crisis as a result of economic asphyxiation. And this Parliament has said so. You have voted on resolutions here where you say that no sanction can be applied to harm the people of Venezuela. You voted for that. And so the European Union has not applied economic sanctions against the people of Venezuela, but against its leaders. And, if we need more, more. But against the leaders. You cannot expect to resolve the crisis in Venezuela by massively condemning its people to hunger. It is a serious political problem that we must deal with politically, but we cannot close our eyes to the need— and many have said so — to seek solutions that replace humanitarian aid that the international community will not provide. Because we're not going to collect $1.5 billion of donations, which is what it takes for that, when until now the contributions are in the order of ten times less that amount. I believe, ladies and gentlemen, that we are talking about a problem of an immense human dimension. The problem is not that the dictator is a communist. The problem is that this country is facing a political situation to which we have to respond as we are doing, and I believe that Europe has mobilized its diplomatic and political energies for this, but we cannot close our eyes to the fact that measures are being taken contrary to what you have voted for. Measures are being taken that dramatically harm the people of Venezuela. And that, believe me, is not going to be the solution. That's not going to be the solution.  The solution must be sought in an attempt to use Europe's diplomatic and political resources, in full cooperation and collaboration with Mrs Bachelet. Nothing I say takes away a gram of responsibility from Venezuela's political regime, but I think it would be a mistake on our part to think that migration flows are going to decrease if we continue to keep the country in a situation of economic asphyxiation.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 288, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Marcel KOLAJA", "mepid": "197546", "text": "  The debate is closed.

The EU position has been consistent since the beginning of the crisis. Our policy is to support a peaceful, negotiated and, above all, democratic solution. As in the case of Venezuela, only the Nicaraguan people can choose their leaders and representatives in a free and fair election in line with international standards. Here we can say it’s actually the same thing as in Venezuela, and the government must respect and protect the human rights and freedoms of the people. We established this position last January when, just ahead of the visit by the European Parliament to Managua, the Foreign Affairs Council underlined its readiness to use all policy instruments to contribute to a peaceful, negotiated way out of the crisis and to react to the further deterioration of human rights. At the beginning of this year, the Nicaraguan Government accepted to seek a negotiated way out and sign two agreements on the liberation of prisoners and the re—establishment of political freedoms. But it is clear that the government has failed to live up to these commitments. Most prisoners were indeed freed, but many were arrested again immediately afterwards. Political freedoms were not re—established. Reacting to these negative signals, the Foreign Affairs Council adopted a framework for individual targeted sanctions on 14 October. This, concretely, means prohibiting the entry into European Union territory and freezing the assets of people or organisations who have taken a key role in the numerous human rights abuses carried out by the regime. Our sanctions are individual, reversible and, above all, designed not to harm the Nicaraguan population as Parliament asked. There are three main areas in which tangible progress needs to be made in order to create the conditions for a peaceful and democratic exit from the crisis. They have stemmed from the commitments undertaken by the government itself – we are not requiring anything else – that fulfil these agreements. We have consistently repeated these in public and private, including as a part of the Council conclusions last October, and they are in line with the recommendations of the High—Level Commission and of the Organization of American States. First, re—establishment of political freedoms and the legal status of banned civil society organisations, as well as the release of the remaining political prisoners without charges. Second, full cooperation with and the return of international human rights bodies to Nicaragua, including the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Third, an agreement on electoral reform between the government and the opposition, including the Civic Alliance. This agreement should guarantee fair and transparent elections, according to international standards, and be in line with the European Union electoral observation recommendation. We are ready to support with expertise and eventually with an electoral observation mission. The European Union stands with the Nicaraguan people and recalls that repression needs to stop and respect for the constitutional rights of all Nicaraguans must be re—established, including the right to liberty and the freedoms of expression, assembly, religion and peaceful protest. That’s what I want to again stress today in front of the Members of this Parliament, hoping, I’m sure, that with your support you can apply more pressure in order to fulfil these requirements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PSE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 292, "date": "2019-12-18.json", "name": "Leopoldo LÓPEZ GIL", "mepid": "197777", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President, I greet and applaud the words of the High Representative.

I would like to recall that in 1979 the people of Nicaragua fought and died for freedom, for democracy, for dignity, against the dictatorship of Somoza. I was there and I remember the absolutely fundamental support of Felipe González's Spanish Socialist Workers' Party. Forty years later it is tragic that this town has to fight again and die for the same thing, and this time against a new liberticide, that of the Ortega-Murillo marriage. Yesterday was the Soochistic National Guard, today it is the political police, the armed gangs that blood the streets of the cities in Nicaragua. The reports of Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, the Organization of American States, the United Nations, the Meseni, are absolutely abracadabrating, they are devastating. Because in Nicaragua there is neither democracy, nor justice, nor human rights, basic principles that cannot be excluded from our conscience and solidarity. That is why the most important groups in this Parliament have agreed on a joint resolution without amendment.

Every one of you wishes the best for the Nicaraguan people. Me too. But politics is not just piling up wishes. What can we do? Some have proposed suspending the European Union-Central America trade agreement with Nicaragua. I think the suspension of the trade part of the EU-Central American Association Agreement could create hardship for the Nicaraguan population, not only in Nicaragua but also in the rest of the Central American region. And I do not think this is a good idea.  Why not suspend EU cooperation? We haven’t suspended EU cooperation, once again, to avoid harming the Nicaraguan population. Our cooperation activities have been screened to ensure that they do not benefit the regime directly and our financial instruments have been used to support human rights defenders and the Nicaraguan refugees in Costa Rica. Why has the European Investment Bank not suspended its operation? For the same reason. We are sticking to our contractual obligations.  Should we call for early elections? Well, during the demonstrations in mid-2018 the opposition insisted on bringing forward the elections, a request that President Ortega fiercely rejected. I think that if electoral reforms are not adopted beforehand, then the electoral process would be of no help. Our priority should be the implementation of electoral reforms on the basis of the recommendations made by the European Union in the last observation mission.  Why haven’t we sanctioned Ortega or Vice-President Murillo? Well, the US and Canada have adopted individual sanctions against Vice-President Murillo and members of the Ortega/Murillo family. We haven’t done it yet. This is something the Member States should be reflecting upon. I don’t exclude it, but sanctions are meant to create incentives for a change. That’s why and how we have to calibrate them.  Are we expecting to send an electoral observation mission to Nicaragua? Well, in the current situation of repression and failure of the rule of law, I do not think it would make any sense. What we have to do is put our political and diplomatic pressure in order to release the prisoners, not only the Belgian lady that has been mentioned, there are many others. I have to inform you that our head of delegation in Nicaragua has been visiting the families of these prisoners and in particular, the father of Amaya.  We will continue putting political pressure, because I think that there we really have a systematic violation of human rights and there is no excuse for it. It’s not a matter of multinational injuries, it’s clearly a matter of a regime which doesn’t pass any kind of test about their behaviour with respect to their people’s rights.  I have mentioned the desirability of adding names to the list of individual sanctions. This would require a discussion at the level of the European Union foreign affairs ministers and then agreement by unanimity. We will discuss it and I really ask for your support in order to face the situation in Nicaragua, which is, as I said, as bad as in Venezuela, but we don’t talk about Nicaragua as much. Today is a good occasion to do so.

I and my service have followed the developments around the recent protests very closely. Since they began on 15 November, one month ago, we have been trying to obtain reliable verified information on the number of deaths, injuries and arrest. We have also seen, as I am sure you have, video of snipers shooting at protesters and seen official confirmation of at least 7 000 people arrested. This underlines the severity and the magnitude of what is occurring, what has occurred, what is still happening.  We have not been silent in response to these developments; on the contrary, we have responded both privately and publicly. Indeed, my first statement as High Representative on behalf of the 28 – still 28 – Member States on 9 December was about the protests in Iran. In that statement we clearly stated that despite repeated calls for restraint, the Iranian security forces’ disproportionate response to the demonstrations led to a high number of deaths and injuries, and once more I want to emphasise that whether in Iran or elsewhere, the widespread use of force against non—violent protesters is unacceptable. We have urged the Iranian authorities to ensure transparent and credible investigations to clarify the number of deaths and arrests and we expect all perpetrators of violence to be held accountable.  I’m aware that this crackdown also extended to access to the internet and that Iranian citizens were prevented from accessing global networks, which severely impacted communication and the free flow of information.  We are committed to pursuing a balanced and comprehensive approach with Iran; a balanced and comprehensive approach with Iran with a view to addressing all issues of concern and this of course includes our long-standing concerns regarding the human rights situation. In the context of the regular EU-Iran high-level political dialogue with Iran – with the adoption of the Iran nuclear deal, the famous JCPOA – we have raised human rights issues and cases. We have also regularly engaged with the authorities to demand progress on several important human rights, including the use of the death penalty, the rights of women and Iran’s practice of detaining dual nationals. This has also extended to demanding such improvements in international fora such as the United Nations Human Rights Council.  I fully understand the severity of the situation with regard to the protests, and we will continue to address this response and urge concrete actions as part of our diplomacy with Iran, which is not limited to the nuclear problems still. We firmly believe that the Iranian authorities must live up to their international obligations, including both the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Rights such as freedom of expression and assembly must always be respected and I am looking forward to working with you to promote better respect for these rights across the world.

Just, therefore, add a few elements to what the high representative said. First, remember that these demonstrations are surely the largest that have been experienced in four decades of Iran's current regime. Demonstrations that, as has been said, have failed to take place peacefully and in which proven reports from the United Nations and Amnesty International have shown that they have caused at least 300 dead and 7,000 non-fatalities. Many of these protesters, it has also been said, have been arbitrarily detained, face death sentences, and are also denied basic rights, such as informing their relatives of their whereabouts and health status, as well as assisting effective legal defense. The high representative himself spoke of the digital blackout. I believe that the resolution which this Parliament votes on tomorrow is a necessary initiative, which we hope will support and contribute to the work you are doing in this area. The voice of the European Union and this Parliament must be heard. The Iranian government's reaction has been extremely violent and could be the beginning of a more oppressive cycle in the coming days.

Last month saw the biggest protest since the 1979 revolution break out in response to a 50% increase in fuel prices. This peaceful protest was followed by a brutal crackdown by the Iranian authorities, involving the arrest of up to 7 000 individuals, hundreds of people being injured, and according to Amnesty International, at least 304 people, including children, have been killed. Freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are recognised as fundamental rights by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to which Iran is party. The protestors in Iran had a legitimate reason to be protesting, yet the Iranian authorities responded disproportionately and inflicted harm on them. It is the duty of governments to protect their own people. These actions are a far cry from that. Furthermore, the nationwide shutdown of online communications by the government has made it difficult for Iranians to tell their stories. This is an infringement of their free speech. Such behaviour is set against a backdrop of an increasingly repressive environment in Iran, which has seen human rights defenders, independent media, lawyers and online activists targeted for speaking out about what is happening in the country.

The official death toll as well as the whereabouts of many detainees continue to be unknown. There are also credible claims that those who have been held in detention have been subjected to ill treatment. Journalists, students and human rights defenders have been among those detained and killed for defending their rights. We therefore have to call on the Iranian authorities to put an end to the ongoing crackdown on protesters and to ensure that a prompt and impartial investigation, led by the United Nations, is carried out to clarify the facts and hold accountable all those responsible. The EU and its Member States should join this call and ensure proper scrutiny of the facts by proposing an independent inquiry into those human rights allegations. The economic situation in Iran has been worsening as a result of the US sanctions, and the recent protests are a reflection of this economic unease.

These sanctions must be removed, and this must also be made clear from here. The worsening of the social situation in Iran is not only made in Iran, but also made in the USA. Anyone who is really serious about human rights must also criticise the United States, which must stop its unilateral policy of interests in the Middle East, because that is destructive.

I’ve lost count of how many virtue-signalling MEPs have tried to score cheap points by insulting Europe’s greatest protector and ally, but if we want to keep the Middle East nuclear-free, resume trade, and support the human rights of Iranians, only the Americans have the power, relationships and influence in the region to make this happen.

We have to keep making it clear that we have a nuclear agreement.

The imposition of sanctions cannot and should not be an excuse for the brutality and violence of a regime that relies increasingly on the repressive apparatus and paramilitary forces with which violence is carried out at home, but also in the region.  Whatever the interests, the European Union must strongly condemn the regime's actions in Tehran and unequivocally tell it that, despite our interests, we will not depart from our fundamental values. We must demand from our interlocutors that at least minimum established human rights, international law and, last but not least, respect for our own national law.  The brutality of the regime, however, points to its instability and sense of danger, and the Iranian theocratic regime must be aware that the use of brutal force at home and the creation of regional hegemony will prove to be a viable one.

It’s obviously natural and right to support the victims of repression, but the skewed emphasis in this Parliament to twist it into a one-sided imperialist human rights agenda that only condemns repression in Iran, China, Russia, whatever – never the United States or Europe and their clients. Where’s the speaking out against the repression of Palestinians brutally repressed by the vicious Israeli war criminals? This helps to downplay genuine human rights abuses.

I can assure you that we will not ignore the plight of the thousands of individuals in Iran who were involved in, or affected by, the protests. I confirm our commitment to address these issues with Iran, publicly and privately, until we’ve got clarity on the full scale of what has occurred and with the expectation that those identified as responsible for the violence will be held accountable. This is in general terms. I will try to answer some of the specific issues that you have raised. It has been asserted that support for the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) has prevented the European Union from focusing on other issues. That’s not true. We have engaged in a frank and active dialogue with Iran on all issues, maintaining a range of EU autonomous restrictive measures, including on human rights violations.  We don’t believe that we would be in a better situation to address those without the JCPOA being in place. I can assure you that this is my strong belief. The JCPOA was first enshrined by a United Nations Security Council resolution and was not an invention by Europeans. It was the United Nations Security Council which adopted this agreement and we view it as a crucial issue for regional and European security. No one wants to see a nuclear arms race in the region and no one has been able to come up with a peaceful way of ensuring that Iran does not develop a nuclear weapon.  Having said this, we have on several occasions since June 2019 expressed our strong concern about Iran’s reduction in its commitment and we will continue defending the objective and full obligation of this agreement. We will do our best in order to save the JCPOA Agreement. Other people say that we are too soft on Iran. I want to engage with you in a frank and deep debate, and not to say that everybody is happy. No. Let’s go to the real issues. Are we too soft on Iran? I don’t think so. The EU still has a number of sanctions in place: first, nuclear proliferation sanctions under the CPOA; second, human rights sanctions – currently 83 individuals and entities, including a ban on exports to Iran of equipment which might be used for internal repression and equipment to monitor telecommunications because, when you disturb the traffic on the internet, you do that with sophisticated telecom instruments – and, third, sanctions under our Syria and CP931 terrorist regime.  So we are not being especially soft or hard. We do what we have to do and personally I think that you will understand that the JCPOA is something that is important for us, but it doesn’t prevent us from taking a tough position when such things as the ones we have seen in Iran happen. It is the case for additional human rights listing in response to the protest. To tell the truth, there are currently no proposals for additional listing on the table.  Having said that, the process for the annual review of the human rights regime is ongoing. As things stand, we still have human rights sanctions in place, as I told you, which affect 83 individuals and entities in Iran. This is a difficult question and we will continue working on it, at the same time using our diplomatic capacity in order to save a deal that is very important for our security and, on the other hand, defending human rights in Iran and elsewhere with our sanctions regime, our diplomatic pressure and our permanent claim to respect human rights.  This has been a very intensive part-session. It was my first part-session, ‘mon baptême de feu’. I would like to thank all of you for all your contributions and for your support. I know that not everybody sees things in the same way. From the left to the right, there are different approaches and different understandings of what’s happening in this difficult world in which we have to live. Today, having covered four difficult issues, thank you all for your contribution and thank you for your support for my job.

We are serious about our joint commitment, under the European consensus on development and sustainable development goals, to work with partners to eliminate all forms of sexual and gender-based violence and discrimination, including harmful practices such as, in particular, female genital mutilation. The EU and its Member States have long demonstrated strong commitment and leadership at multilateral level in promoting the rights of women and girls and gender equality. The Joint EU-UN spotlight initiative to eliminate violence against women and girls is an exemplary case in point, an unprecedented global effort to invest in gender equality and women’s empowerment as a precondition and driver for the achievement of the sustainable development goals. In Africa, the spotlight initiative is addressing sexual and gender-based violence, child marriage, female genital mutilation and their linkages to sexual and reproductive health access. The recent International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD +25) Summit, co-hosted by Denmark, Kenya and the UN Population Fund in Nairobi, was extremely successful. Extensive financial pledges were made from both public and private sources, as well as political commitments, notably a reaffirmation of efforts to achieve zero female genital mutilation by 2030, in line with our commitment under the 2030 agenda for sustainable development. Our achievements and leadership are real, but we must continue pushing until we have lived up to our commitment to achieve the objective of zero harmful practices against women and girls. The UN has named 6 February as the international day of zero tolerance for female genital mutilation, and around that day, the European Commission will take stock, as every year, of EU efforts in this field. We look forward to this report. We would also look with keen interest at the proposal from the Commission to renew the EU’s strategic engagement for gender equality that will be expiring at the end of this month. This should, hopefully, include an EU strategy to end female genital mutilation around the world once and for all. Before concluding, let me recall that, unfortunately, a significant number of women in the EU live with the lifelong consequences of female genital mutilation or are at risk of it. Without dismissing our achievements, therefore, we are aware of the need to do more in Europe with respect to the implementation of national laws, specialised support services, or enhancing multidisciplinary actions with affected communities. But I am convinced that, by continuing to work together, we will be able to secure further achievements in Europe and globally.

I also thank the Finnish Government for their commitment towards gender equality. This is a subject that is very close to my heart and I am committed to doing everything within my power to eliminate this scourge, this suffering which millions of girls and women are made to endure, even now as we speak. It is essential that we expose and combat this severe violation of human rights, women’s rights and children’s rights.  The EU and the United Nations programme to eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls, with an investment of EUR 100 million, is the Spotlight Initiative, as was already mentioned. With this project, the scope is to leave no girl, no woman behind. The current EU projects in several African countries and the support the EU gave to the UNICEF programme on abandonment of female genital mutilation (FGM) have reached more than 1.5 million women, who received services for protection and care related to FGM. This programme also galvanised civic movement through the encouragement of more than 3 000 communities, representing 8.5 million individuals, to make a public declaration of abandonment.  We know that FGM exists also within the European Union. Estimates show that at least half a million girls and women who have suffered from genital mutilation live in Europe. The European Institute for Gender Equality plays a leading role in providing information and research on female genital mutilation in the EU. In all our Member States, FGM is a crime. The efforts to combat it and support its victims are also integrated in EU legislation, notably the Victims’ Rights Directive. The issue is covered in EU asylum legislation.  The Commission continues to provide funding through the DAPHNE strand of the EU programmes for projects aimed at combating gender-based violence, including FGM. The next call for proposals will open in early 2020 with an indicative budget of EUR 12.4 million.  Honourable Members, we need to do more to make sure that the predictions of another estimated 200 million FGM victims by 2030 will not materialise. President von der Leyen’s Agenda for Europe has put the prevention of gender-based violence and the protection of victims at the heart of the Union’s equality policy for these five years. I am fully committed to the fight against gender-based violence and I am sure I can count on the support of the European Parliament on this matter.  The forthcoming robust gender equality strategy, which we will adopt in 2020, will address violence against women directly through various measures, including those addressing FGM. It is important to work on different areas at the same time and to tackle the issue from different angles and across the portfolios. I believe we can continue to work on the five priority areas outlined in the 2013 Commission communication on ending female genital mutilation, that is: improving knowledge and data, supporting sustainable social change, protection, prosecution and combating FGM worldwide.  Women’s rights are indeed at the core of EU foreign policy, and this includes the fight against FGM. We need to work with our international partners across the world to support the implementation of the UN sustainable development goals, which cover violence against women. The European Parliament has an important role to play through its political networks around the world. We have to acknowledge that FGM is a sensitive matter to tackle. It encompasses a variety of areas, from general human rights to women’s right to bodily integrity, the tackling of gender-based violence and the right to health. This is why it is important that we work together with FGM survivors, FGM practicing communities and experts in an empowering manner, free of misunderstandings and misconceptions. We must avoid stigmatisation, racism and xenophobia at all costs. We should instead promote empowerment, cooperation and dialogue. Apart from funding and legislation, we must include all stakeholders at all levels, from our political dialogues with national administrations, to our support for health care professionals, religious and community leaders, and families in eradicating female genital mutilation once and for all. I look forward to your views today, and to working with you towards this mandate on this very important issue.

Female genital mutilation (FGM): three words that have come to be understood as culture, tradition, even as a medical procedure. But those three words, those three letters are none of those things. What those three words are: an assault – violence, violence against women. And violence against women which results, as we know, in fundamental life-changing injuries: injuries that damage women and the very essence of what it means to be a woman. As of October 2019, UNICEF estimates that 200 million women and girls have undergone FGM in 30 countries – and that is just an estimation, let’s be clear, with many cases going unreported. When they think of FGM, most people’s minds go to the African continent, to places like Guinea, where 97% of women have undergone FGM, including 45% of girls below 14 years of age; places like Ethiopia, where 65% of women have undergone FGM. But the reality is, it’s happening in countries across the world, in places like Indonesia, Malaysia, and so on. What would we say if this was our mother, our sister, our wife, our cousins? Would we be as complacent as we sometimes are? We would be outraged. And we have to be the voice for those women who cannot speak for themselves. We are working to make sure the Istanbul Convention is implemented. Be clear: FGM is violence against women, and we must use every resource available to us to eradicate it. How do we do this? It has to be a serious, top-priority re-engagement on this issue. We have to have political leadership from the political leaders around the world, men and women. We must engage in a global multi-stakeholder approach: NGOs, communities and families working together. UNICEF concluded, from the surveys they have conducted, that the majority of girls and women in most countries with available data think FGM should end. We need champions to make this happen, like Ms Kanko, who I thank for raising this issue, like Ifrah Ahmed, an Irish champion who is working with the government of Somalia to eradicate FGM.

Madam President, female genital mutilation covers all interventions that involve altering a woman's genitals for non-medical reasons and are a violation of the fundamental rights of women and girls. These practices also violate their right to sexual and reproductive health as well as their physical integrity. Mutilation is a universal problem that affects countries in Africa, the Middle East, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia and Europe. In Germany, according to a prevalence study, there are more than 20,000 circumcised women and more than 4,000 girls considered at risk of female circumcision. The victims of mutilation living in Europe are mainly from immigration; they are in total close to 500,000. Genital mutilation is based on a foundation of social norms and erroneous religious beliefs. Despite a clear setback and the development of laws in 24 of the 29 countries concerned in Africa, pockets of resistance still exist. The participation of dignitaries and religious of Islamic obedience in awareness campaigns could be an asset in the eradication of genital mutilation. These are obsolete traditions that, over time, have been falsely equated with the Islamic religion. There is nothing in the Qur'an, the Bible or the Torah that requires a woman to be excised. Awareness and education work, supported by health practitioners, with the participation of young people, the future Charming Princes, can bring a new lease of life to achieve zero tolerance by 2030. We need to break the taboo through awareness and prevention, to reorient female circumcisors to other income-generating activities, and to work with the communities that practice mutilation, without stigmatizing them. The European Union must support organisations that help protect the physical integrity of women and girls, while respecting each other's culture, so that we can achieve the abolition of female genital mutilation.

FGM is an extreme form of discrimination and violence against women. To excise is to cut the clitoris of young girls, even children, with scissors or razor blades. These are acts of torture that constitute an attack on the dignity of women. The disturbing truth is that our countries have imported on our soil cultural and religious traditions that practice these acts of barbarism. Today, about 124,000 girls in France have undergone this barbaric practice and 21% of girls from countries practising female genital mutilation are at risk. The European Commission estimates that more than half a million women in Europe have been maimed, alarming and intolerable figures. What kind of society do we become, when so many girls in our own country have to live with the fear of being maimed? At the last plenary session in Strasbourg, my group proposed an amendment on these acts of torture. We condemned this hideous practice, we advocated clear measures to be taken, but unfortunately the text was rejected for political reasons. The list is there: 450 parliamentarians voted against. In some areas, female genital mutilation may be based on tradition, but this is not our tradition. Such beliefs have no place in our societies. In France, young girls who are victims of female circumcision point out that French legislation was not strong enough to counterbalance the weight of social pressure. It is therefore high time that our countries systematically prosecute the perpetrators of female genital mutilation. I therefore urge Member States to enforce mandatory reporting of genital mutilation by health and education professionals.

So let's look at what can actually be done about prevention. Today, a very good example was that, at the initiative of my fellow Member Kanko, we were able to receive a group of young Kenyan girls called 'The Restorers', as others have mentioned, and indeed have a dialogue with the younger generations. Let us note that only in Africa, the continent I love dearly, 42 percent of the population is under the age of 14. With the new generations growing up on the youngest continent, we need to do much more, much more efficiently, but this can only be achieved through dialogue and education. We must stand up for the women and girls in the conflict who are among the most at risk. When we talk about tradition, tradition, it has nothing to do with religion. Education is an indispensable tool for gender equality and women's empowerment and empowerment.

Female genital mutilation is an absolutely barbaric practice, it is indeed a crime. I don't know any justification for any social, cultural norms or customs.

We have been talking about this repeatedly since the last period and this is really striking that in the European Area this practice is on the rise. Yes, they are closed communities or communities of newly arrived refugees, but clearly the control component is failing. Those who are supposed to oversee this action from the point of view of criminalising it are closing their eyes.

I will work so that the EU will manage to ratify the Convention during this term, but I count on your support to convince the remaining Member States.

In February, we will indeed celebrate the International Day of Zero Tolerance for Female Genital Mutilation (FGM).  Ladies and gentlemen, let’s now put an end to FGM once and for all. All women and girls should be allowed to live free and safe, as whole individuals. In the light of the proposed accession of the EU to the Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence, the Istanbul Convention, the Finnish Presidency calls on all actors to devote special attention to ensuring coherence between internal and external EU policies and action.  Combating all forms of violence against women and young girls is a core element of the respect for human rights and fundamental rights. Our Finnish Presidency has continued working on the EU accession to the Istanbul Convention, and we have encouraged those that still have not ratified the Istanbul Convention to do so. I have no doubt that, among those actors, the European Parliament – you, as representatives – will continue to lead on those issues that are at the heart of our common EU values.  Thank you again for this very important debate, and it this indeed a great honour to conclude the Finnish Presidency with this important topic. President, allow me to thank you all for this extraordinary autumn. It has indeed been a tremendous time with you here in the Parliament, debating all kinds of different topics. I’ve spent hours representing the Council and the Member States in this plenary here in Strasbourg and in Brussels, and it has been worth every minute. Thank you so much. Thank you all. Our Presidency eventually comes to an end, but the fight for human rights, democracy and the rule of law continues. Thank you all, and I wish you all a Merry Christmas.
