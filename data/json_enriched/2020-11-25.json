Before we begin our plenary session, I would like to address the issue of violence in our society. We need to talk about it for so many reasons. We need to talk about it in order to free the voices of the victims and help them break their silence. We need to talk about it in order to raise awareness and express our commitment to non-violence and equality. Above all, we must talk about it in order to find solutions and put an end to this scourge that affects our society. This year the COVID-19 crisis has revealed and intensified this violence, especially domestic violence. This has often happened in a sneaky way, behind closed doors, with no possibility of escape, not least because in many Member States shelters and assistance lines are deficient or not sufficiently funded. This is unacceptable. The European Parliament will continue to insist that all EU Member States ratify the Istanbul Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and we will work, together with the other institutions, to present a directive on combating gender-based violence. As the European Parliament, we have set an example by turning one of our buildings into a temporary centre to house vulnerable women affected by COVID-19. Our public institutions have a decisive role to play and they must be close to the citizens, they must set a good example and be able to help them. That is also why we are all proud of the work that the European Parliament carried out during the negotiations on the Multiannual Financial Framework to guarantee an additional EUR 0.8 billion for the Rights and Values programme, which provides funding for gender equality, the fight against violence against women and girls. In addition, the Commission will develop a methodology for assessing Community funding to promote gender equality and to improve gender mainstreaming in Community programmes. We have a duty, as institutions, to talk and raise the debate on the violence that women and girls suffer and we must talk about it in the right words, but it is also necessary to strengthen ourselves collectively, adopting an integrated, global approach that focuses on socio-economic and institutional aspects, gender equality and women's rights. On the occasion of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, the European Parliament is committed to pursuing this objective, to doing so for women and girls, but also for all of us.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 1, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   The next item is the debate on the Council and Commission statements on the preparation of the European Council meeting of 10 and 11 December 2020 (2020/2833(RSP)).

It’s about Brexit and about the situation we are facing with respect to the Multiannual Financial Framework and NextGenerationEU. Honourable Members, these are decisive days for our negotiations with the United Kingdom, but frankly I cannot tell you today if in the end there will be a deal. There has been genuine progress on a number of important questions: on law enforcement and judicial cooperation; on social security coordination, and also on goods, on services and transport we now have an outline of a possible final text. In these areas there are still some important issues to agree, but they should be manageable. However, there are still three issues that can make the difference between a deal and no deal. The crucial topics for the European side are of course questions linked to the level playing field, governance and fisheries. With very little time ahead of us, we will do all in our power to reach an agreement. We are ready to be creative. But we are not ready to call into question the integrity of the Single Market – the main safeguard for European prosperity and wealth. This is why we need to establish robust mechanisms, ensuring that competition is – and remains – free and fair over time. In the discussions about state aid we have still serious issues, for instance when it comes to enforcement. Significant difficulties remain on the question how we can secure – now and over time – our common high standards on labour, on social rights, on the environment, climate change and tax transparency – you know all these standards. We want to know what remedies are available in case one side will deviate in the future. Because trust is good, but law is better. And crucial in the light of recent experience: a strong governance system is essential to ensure that what has been agreed is actually done. Concerning fisheries: no one questions the UK’s sovereignty on its own waters, but we ask for predictability and guarantees for our fishermen and fisherwomen who have been sailing in these waters for decades, if not centuries. Honourable Members, as I said, the next days are going to be decisive. The European Union is well prepared for a no-deal-scenario, but of course we prefer to have an agreement. I fully trust in the skilful steer of our Chief Negotiator Michel Barnier, but one thing is clear: whatever the outcome, there has to be – and there will be – a clear difference between being a full member of the Union and being just a valued partner. I am fully aware of the challenges the current situation is creating especially for Parliament and the ratification process, and this is why I sincerely thank you for your support and understanding. As in the past, we will walk those last miles together. Sehr geehrte Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Zur gleichen Zeit wartet die Union auf grünes Licht für unseren nächsten mehrjährigen Finanzrahmen und NextGenerationEU. Die Kommission hat im Mai ihr Aufbauprogramm NextGenerationEU und den Mehrjahreshaushalt vorgelegt. Die Staats- und Regierungschefs der 27 EU—Mitgliedstaaten haben im Juli vier lange Tage und Nächte verhandelt und einen Kompromiss gefunden. Sie, meine sehr verehrten Damen und Herren Abgeordnete, haben dieses Paket weiterentwickelt. Am Ende steht jetzt ein Ergebnis, das die vielen politischen Anliegen angemessen berücksichtigt.  Jetzt haben zwei Mitgliedstaaten Zweifel angemeldet. Der beste Weg wäre, diese Zweifel auszuräumen. Im Juli haben sich alle 27 Staats- und Regierungschefs auch auf einen Konditionalitätsmechanismus verständigt. Es geht hier um Verstöße gegen das Rechtsstaatsprinzip, die das europäische Budget gefährden, und nur um diese. Das ist angemessen, das ist verhältnismäßig, und das ist auch notwendig. Es ist sehr schwer vorstellbar, dass irgendjemand in Europa irgendetwas dagegen haben könnte. Meine Damen und Herren, wer dennoch Zweifel hat, für den gibt es einen klaren Weg. Er kann vor den Europäischen Gerichtshof ziehen und die neuen Regeln auf Herz und Nieren prüfen lassen. Das ist der Ort, an dem wir üblicherweise Meinungsverschiedenheiten über Rechtstexte auslegen, und nicht zu Lasten von Millionen Europäerinnen und Europäern, die dringend auf unsere Hilfe warten. Wir sind ihnen eine rasche Antwort schuldig. Und zwar denjenigen, die ihre Restaurants und Geschäfte zu unserem Wohl vorübergehend schließen mussten, denjenigen, die in ihrer Existenz bedroht sind, den Menschen, die um ihre Jobs bangen – auch in Polen und in Ungarn. Honourable Members, this is especially the case as the pandemic situation remains serious. With nearly 3 000 deaths a day, COVID-19 was the number one cause of death in the EU last week. Hospitals remain under stress, and in some regions intensive care units are overwhelmed. I know that shop owners, bartenders and waiters in restaurants want an end to restrictions, but we must learn from the summer and not repeat the same mistakes. Relaxing restrictions too fast and too much risks there being a third wave after Christmas. Weeks ago, I said that this Christmas will be different. And yes, it will be quieter. This is also a question of solidarity between Member States.  But there is also good news. The Commission has now secured contracts on vaccines with six pharmaceutical companies. The first European citizens might already be vaccinated before the end of December. There is finally light at the end of the tunnel. And yes, as I’ve said, vaccines are important, but what counts are vaccinations. Member States must get ready now. We’re talking about millions of syringes, we’re talking about the cold chain, we’re talking about organising vaccination centres, we’re talking about trained personnel that is there – you name it, all this has to be prepared. In short, Member States have to prepare the logistics for the deployment of hundreds of millions of doses of vaccines, because this is our ticket out of the pandemic.  Honourable Members, with or without COVID, there is another crisis that rumbles on: global warming, the crisis of our planet. And, honourable Members, a growing number of countries have pledged carbon neutrality by 2050. Good news. I firmly believe we must all put a price on carbon. These words could have been mine, but they’re not. These are the remarks of António Guterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, at the G20 summit last weekend. For the first time in four years, the G20 agreed on clear commitments for the fight against climate change, and Europe has been proudly leading the way. By now, more than half of the G20 members have committed to climate or carbon neutrality around 2050. This demonstrates that being courageous pays off, and it shows that we have chosen the right course when we decided to cut back CO2 emissions until 2030 by at least 55%. This should also encourage the Heads of State and Government to confirm this goal at the next European Council. Et avec cela, nous voulons renforcer la coopération et permettez-moi de parler à la fin de la sécurité des personnes en Europe. Je suis sûre que je parle au nom de toute l’Union quand je dis que l’Europe est solidaire des Français et des Autrichiens. L’Europe est unie face aux attaques terroristes au cœur de nos villes et l’Europe est prête à agir. Le 9 décembre, la Commission présentera un nouvel agenda européen pour la lutte contre le terrorisme, nous voulons renforcer la coopération entre les services de sécurité, nous voulons donner aux gardes-frontières la technologie moderne dont ils ont besoin, intensifier nos efforts pour éviter la radicalisation et mieux protéger les lieux publics. But there is only so much we can do when Member States do not put into practice what they agree upon. For example, the strong rules against money laundering and terrorist financing, or against the use of firearms. Implementation is key and I’m sure the European Council will be an opportunity to turn to action quickly. Honourable Members, from Brexit to the fight against the pandemic, from the budget to the fight against terrorists, it is when we manage to join forces that we Europeans can achieve the most. It is when we negotiate hard and then stick to the compromise found that we move forward best. This is how we will finally leave the corona world and continue to build our future. Lang lebe Europa!

If we look at the Council, we should be reminded of the situation in europe as a whole. There is a lot of fear, a lot of concern in this European Union. People are looking forward to Christmas and don't know how to celebrate Christmas. Economic forecasts have improved somewhat, but 2020 is still a historic 7% to 8% slump in our European economy. In our neighbourhood we have enormous uncertainty with Turkey, with Brexit. It is therefore not the time for party politics, nor is it the time for national selfishness, but it is the time to work together now and to give orientation to the people of this continent, to give hope, to give perspective, to show a strong Europe. The first central point is the question of Corona. I am a proud European because we have managed to find a common path in vaccination, on the vaccination strategy. I would like to warmly congratulate the Commission, including you, Madam President of the Commission, on the fact that this common approach has been practised. It was European researchers who were at the forefront of this, who have made this great progress with European research money. With the treaties that have been concluded, we will now show that there are not poor and rich Europeans, there are no large and small countries, but that all Europeans will have access to this vaccine at the same time and can be vaccinated accordingly. We should ensure that distribution begins as simultaneously as possible in all the member states of the European Union, in order to make this comprehensible.  This development of vaccines also shows us what Europeans can achieve if we invest. I am thinking, for example, of cancer, another major health issue. If we act together, we can achieve a great deal. The second, of course, is the economy: EUR 1.8 trillion, Corona and MFF are on the table together. It shows that we stand in solidarity. It would be a sign of stability if we could achieve results quickly, and that is why the veto by Poland and Hungary is simply irresponsible. We in the European Parliament have healed the mistake of the July Council. At that time, the Heads of State or Government were not in a position to take appropriate decisions on the rule of law. I would like to thank our team very much. Without the European Parliament, this mechanism would not exist, and together we have now achieved a great deal. I would still like to argue that I would like to discuss with Hungary and Poland, because, for example, the argument that Europe would dictate how to organise abortion in Poland is simply a lie. It is simply a lie! The European Union will not have a say on abortion issues, because it is national competence. Therefore: Please deal with the arguments fairly! The second is that if someone claims that this proposal is not covered by the Lisbon Treaty, as Viktor Orban does, then All I can say is that I see it differently, and please go to the ECJ and let it be clarified there. This is how the European Union works, but not with a veto. That is why we must send out a clear signal: the European Parliament will not back down a millimetre. This mechanism is right, it is necessary, it is overdue, and the sword that we then have is then in the hands of the Commission, which I want to motivate to use it, to enforce the rule of law in the European Union. Ladies and gentlemen, another issue is the neighbourhood around us, which creates uncertainty. In particular, I would like to say a few words about Turkey, because that too will play a role in the European Council. The list is now very long: the breach of international law in Syria, Varosia, now the breach of UN resolutions on gas disputes. We have offered Greece to have this clarified in The Hague – that is where Erdogan refuses. And in Libya, the question is whether weapons will be supplied, whether Turkey will supply weapons there, and whether international law, UN resolutions, will also be broken there. And I have not yet talked about what is going on in Turkey with the breach of fundamental values, the independence of the judiciary and the media. Enough is enough! Cyprus and Greece must ensure that the European partners stand by their side, that we act together. And now that Turkey was discussed in the October Council, when sanctions were postponed, we must now make it clear that the words have changed enough, and that action must now follow in the term. European Council. The European Union always offers partnership with Turkey. We want cooperation, but if someone constantly rejects this partnership and constantly provokes us, then there must also be consequences. Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has done. The situation we are in is difficult, but I believe that we have a good chance with the steps that are being taken to show people in the winter of 2020 that it is better if we act together, because then we will be stronger.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 4, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Iratxe GARCÍA PÉREZ", "mepid": "28298", "text": "  on behalf of the S&amp;D Group – Mr President, I will be allowed to begin my speech today, November 25, with a memory of the victims, the women who have been murdered at the hands of their abusers. Our memory and support for their sons, their daughters, their families and the clear commitment that the institutions will not stop working until we get to end the largest scourge that this world is currently living, and that women are killed by the mere fact of being women. Ladies and gentlemen, the position of this Parliament has always been clear. Since 2018 we have been claiming the need for a legislative instrument linking the budget with the defence of the rule of law, and that is why we will not change a single comma from the agreement we have reached in the work of tripartite dialogues with the Council in this regard. This is requested by ⸻the 77% of European citizenship is in accordance with this instrument of the rule of law⸻; we are asked to do so by trade unions in Hungary and Poland; we are asked to do so by the mayors of Warsaw and Budapest; a large part of European citizenship asks us to do so. And it's not time to choose between money and the rule of law. If we want to defend the European project, we need both and we need them urgently. The European Union is not a bazaar. The European Union is a community of law. And in this sense, I also ask for courage. I ask the People's Party for courage to continue to defend the rule of law as it has so far, but understanding that it is quite contradictory when there are Members in its ranks of governing parties who are blocking this proposal. Social democracy, it's clear. We're not going to disappoint the public. Nor Hungary and Poland, which trusts the European Union. Nor will we accept solutions that harm the beneficiaries of the funds. In addition, we are in other kinds of negotiations that are also fundamental to us. Negotiations with the recovery fund continue, and let's hope they come to fruition by the end of the year. And we also expect agreement on our future relationship with the UK. We are on time, but we need to exercise our work and our responsibility as a European Parliament. We cannot give up a reliable and stable governance system, competition rules that protect our internal market and an agreement that guarantees the interests of our fisheries sector. You see, ladies and gentlemen, there are weeks left of work and we have to continue to exercise our responsibility. Months ago we saw competition between Member States in managing the COVID situation. We now see how progress is being made in this health union that our political group claimed from the outset. We have also seen what the need is like to move forward with this transparent plan for the purchase and distribution of vaccines, which is the horizon of hope we have right now. This is how Europe is built, and that is why I ask the council leaders to get to work and not waste a single minute. And I'm done. Don't waste a single minute on reforming the Pact on Migration and Asylum, either. We need a binding mechanism for the relocation of immigrants and refugees. Fundamental rights must be respected. In recent days my country is one of those most under migratory pressure in the Canary Islands, but we have been calling for a real policy of solidarity for many years now, which would have prevented the dramas of Moria, from Lampedusa. We're late, but we're still on time, because in the Mediterranean not only is the lives of human beings sinking.

Mr President, Madam President, I will start with topics that are still under discussion: the draft multi-year budget and the recovery plan, own resources, and the mechanism to protect the rule of law. Europe is being held hostage by two countries that come from a region hard-hit by the communist experience, which has spent a few decades behind the Iron Curtain and where I come from. A region where the pandemic has hit many families hard, where hospitals, entrepreneurs, researchers, farmers, communities and young people are in urgent need of European investment. A region where we still remember very well what the word oppression means, as do the words freedom and democracy. And, in the face of this history, accusing Europe of being Soviet is really ridiculous, even more so when you are behaving yourself as a despot and queuing up to get the first carton of vaccines from Putin. Yes, Europe is being held hostage, but there is no fatality or east-west divide. There are Eastern and Western, North and Southern Europeans who are determined to live in a state of law, respectful of freedom. The European budget is protected from fraud, but we must now also protect it from corruption, in a neutral and impartial manner. But the polls are clear: for European citizens, some authoritarian politicians would no longer listen to their people. They would like us to believe that the abuses come from Brussels. The problem of our Union is not authoritarianism, but the difficulty in deciding and making clear decisions. And in the face of the pandemic, we have begun to show that this is possible. Colleagues, let us also show that Brussels, as they say, knows how to take strong decisions to defend our freedom and democracy and also continue to protect our interests and values in negotiations with the United Kingdom. We must insist that the points that are essential to us are included in the agreement, but also stress the importance, for European democracy, that Parliament has sufficient time before deciding on an unprecedented partnership agreement. But let's do it too by building with our international partners. Let us use all the strength and influence of Europe, as you said, Madam President, and prepare for COP26 in Glasgow today by working with the United States to fight global climate change. Parliament and the Renew Group have already sent a strong message on these issues. We support the Green Pact for Europe and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030. The Council will also have to prove a similar determination and unity on the subject of climate change. I hope you will convey that message to him.

Yet, five months after that date, we are almost back to the starting point. Time has been lost, there are responsibilities and, as you know and as they teach us, time is money, time has financial value, doing things sooner is better than doing things afterwards. Today we are pointing the finger at two countries that veto, legitimately, because we cannot talk about rules that apply only on the one hand and not consider that this power of veto is a legitimate power. Therefore, those who demand respect for the rule of law because it is a fundamental point, a fundamental pillar of the Treaties, must also respect the powers and methods of exercising them, which are guaranteed to countries by the Treaties and our rules. As always, when there is a situation of conflict, the responsibilities are on two sides, they cannot be claimed only on one side. Allow me to play the pun: I am surprised at those who are surprised at this veto today. We knew, and it was clear back in July, that if we had moved forward on a mechanism known as the 'rule of law' - but anyone who has read that regulation knows and cannot but deny that this regulation is not about the rule of law - Poland and Hungary would veto it, and the majority of these institutions have decided, knowingly, to move forward and to provoke this veto. So there are clear responsibilities for delays on both sides and in this Parliament, in the majority of this Parliament which has decided to move forward on a political and punitive mechanism which, I repeat, has nothing to do with respect for the rule of law, provoking the veto of these two countries. I am also surprised by the so-called Pro-Europeans, who are today calling for an intergovernmental agreement to overcome this impasse. I am surprised because they are the ones who wanted to go ahead with the Recovery Fund, on the recovery plan, with the Community method, which has shown all its limitations today, which has shown today what Europe really is. It is not a united continent, it is a continent made up of nations which, legitimately, also have different and conflicting interests. So who's to blame? Who are the responsibility? In my opinion, the greatest responsibility today lies with those who continue to use the rules in a political way to punish those who are not aligned with a certain unique thought. We must take this into account, because the method we use does not work and we cannot expect there to be a dictatorship of the majority, as some would like. The rules are fine when we go in the desired direction, the rules must be changed if a minority goes against the will of the majority. Then we must decide what kind of democracy we want and we must finally decide to understand what the mistakes and limitations of this European Union are. The mistakes of wanting rules that should help us in times of need and when we are in need we must suspend these rules.

It did need a lot of pushing from the European Parliament and not everything is ideal in that package, but this is still an unprecedented common effort to help citizens in an unprecedented crisis. It was - and is - a big step forward in European history.  But now this big success is at risk because two governments only care about their own power and about staying in power because that’s, in the end, what the veto by the Hungarian and Polish Governments is all about. Like Trump, who is killing Corona support in the US, Orbán is doing the same in Europe. Blocking the recovery fund will be felt and shouldered by Hungarian and Polish citizens just as much as by any other Europeans. What a cynical disregard of the needs of one’s own citizens. And let’s not forget that there is no binary choice to be made. The recovery fund is essential to overcome this crisis, the MFF is essential to set the EU on the path to a Green Deal transformation, and equally, the rule of law framework is essential to ensure these EU funds serve the needs and best interests of European citizens.  Dear Hungarian and Polish friends, your governments are gambling with your future. The European Union is founded on values such as human rights, democracy and the rule of law and this Parliament will never stop defending those values. For too long, many governments may not have been happy with straying away from democracy in some Member States, but they have never truly spoken out. That time is over. At this summit, it is time for everyone to take a stance. Decisions are also needed at this summit to ensure that the EU takes serious climate action. At the last summit, any decision on the 2030 climate targets was postponed. Now governments must act. The European Parliament has delivered an ambitious target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 60% by the year 2030, and the governments must now follow suit to allow for swift and decisive climate action. I also want to stress that we need to have an honest emission reduction target, not one with creative calculations and loopholes that might create pretty numbers on paper, but would fail in real life. The task is to preserve a liveable planet in all of its biodiversity and the measures must live up to this target. With an extraordinary year coming to an end, we’re also running out of time to find any agreement with the UK. While we’re immensely sad that the UK will be leaving us, it is also clear that we cannot just simply agree to anything that comes up at the last minute. This Parliament needs time for scrutiny and for debating any possible agreement. As the Verts/ALE Group, we will not just sign off any deal. We will look very closely at whether this is an agreement that is of mutual benefit, that safeguards social and environmental standards and that does not endanger peace in Northern Ireland. We will not hesitate to defend those rights and standards for the benefit of European citizens, but also, we believe, for the benefit of British citizens, now and in the future if the UK decides to rejoin.

But it is the European Parliament, you are proposing to break these rules. There is no link between European funds or the European budget in the Treaties, the disbursement of these funds to the rule of law. This is an attempt by the majority in this Parliament at the moment to impose rules that are not enshrined in the Treaties, which are not in force, which the European Union has never discussed and adopted, so if you are talking about the rule of law, you have to answer yourself the question whether you are breaking this rule of law at the moment. Poland, my country, has often been cited here, and I must tell you that the rule of law is excellent in Poland. In democratic elections, Poles decided to choose a party, my party, Law and Justice, which has formed a government and has consistently implemented the programme to which the Polish people have committed us. Polish, the government cares about the Polish and cares about the interests of Poles, because that is its role and has been obliged to do so in democratic elections. And here we are trying at the moment, here in this House, to convince everyone that the July agreement was about something different than what was actually agreed, because the rule of law, or this discussion that was going on at the time, was going in a completely different direction, and you know that very well.  The will of the majority of minorities cannot be arbitrarily imposed simply because you represent the majority of the European Parliament here believe that what is good for you is good for the European Union - it is not.  The European Union is twenty-seven countries, it is twenty-seven sensibilities, it is twenty-seven nations, it is twenty-seven economies, and it is our duty, because the Treaties oblige us to do so, and what the idea on which the European Union was built obliges us to do so is to solidarity, to take into account the interests of all Member States and all Europeans and to protect the interests of all the people of the European Union and to take care of their interests.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Martin SCHIRDEWAN", "mepid": "190517", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, I would like to thank the The EU budget does not meet the expectations of Europeans or what is needed in the face of the Corona crisis. The Member States have agreed on an historic low in contributions and are reaching deep into the discount box. The roadmap for own resources is so vague that it is doubtful whether there will ever be a comprehensive financial transaction tax or a strong digital tax. And the Rule of Law Mechanism, the rule of law mechanism, has also been weakened and falls far short of what Parliament originally called for. But the fact that it is precisely because of this weak rule of law mechanism that the autocrats in the EU are now taking the Community hostage and vetoing the Corona Reconstruction is completely unacceptable politically. The Orbans and Kaczysskis can only do this because their activities have been watched in silence in recent years and they have been protected from all of them by the conservatives, including in this House, out of power-tactical calculation. The PPE-DE is still refusing – and I am now citing a somewhat more far-sighted conservative – to exclude 'the little dictator Orban'. To demand the rule of law on the one hand and, at the same time, to peddle their enemies is not only implausible, dear conservative colleagues, it is seriously damaging to democracy. On Brexit, it remains a question of whether the left can agree to a deal. We need a robust level playing field to prevent ruinous dumping competition in the social, environmental and consumer protection standards. Boris Johnson must finally show a willingness to compromise, or there is no deal.

He has now reiterated this throughout his time as Prime Minister without succeeding in getting strong measures in place. We even have, lo and behold, a newly built police station outside Stockholm, where the police officers who have been stationed there must have a police escort on their way to or from their work. The situation is horribel to say the least. We have a Minister of Justice who wants newly trained police officers, which in itself is positive. But according to a survey by the Police Federation, 42 percent of current police officers are looking for new jobs because of their vulnerable situation. That's 4 out of 5 cops. Why, then, do we have this situation? Of course, one problem is the governments we have in our own country, both current and past, which have failed completely in their tasks.

As a result, it has resulted in a direct exclusion of people who no longer enter society. The EU and national governments, I mean, have a social contract with their clients, and that is the taxpayer. It is to deliver a safe, secure society to live in, and there we have failed from politics. Violence must be repelled by all means. We must do our part from the European Union and governments must do their part.

The pandemic is not yet over, but this European Council and the decisions that we will make together in the upcoming weeks will determine what the European Union will look like and how the European Union will act in the years to come. I want a European Union in which we are together, united in solidarity and based on our values. These are the principles which I want for the relation with one of our closest neighbours, the United Kingdom. These are the principles which I want when we spend money. We are now about to spend more money than the European Union has ever spent in its history, EUR 1.8 trillion, and the more we spend, the more we need to make sure that money reaches the people in need. The EU budget is money from the people for the people and we, and all of those who manage EU money, have a special responsibility to make sure that EU values are respected. Spending money in the interest of the people means spending it well, but it also means to decide fast. Parliament and Council have made several agreements and in a democracy, once something is agreed you have to adopt, vote and then implement it.  This is why I call upon the European Council and upon the Council of Ministers, to vote and adopt what we have agreed – budget, own resources, recovery package and the rule of law. It’s in the interest of all of us, given that the Union is based on the freedom of people to move, the freedom of companies to move, that the rule of law is respected in every single corner of the European Union. As soon as the budget will be sent to us for a vote, we will vote on it. We expect the Council to do the same.  In conclusion, a word about one of the countries in our immediate neighbourhood. Madam President, dear colleagues, in the Republic of Moldova, a country that we have a direct border with, a pro-European, pro-reform candidate attached to European values and to the rule of law, has won an election against the incumbent, pro-Russian, pro-Kremlin president. This is good news for us, for Europe. This is why I call upon us to work closely with this immediate neighbouring country of the European Union.

We have heard this morning that both teams are working tirelessly, day and night, as well as over the weekends, to finally reach an agreement.  In many fields indeed, texts have now been finalised. However, as the Commission President pointed out, the three major stumbling blocks related to the level playing field, to governance and fisheries remain, due to the British position. There are only 36 days left until the United Kingdom will have left the customs union and the single market, yet there is still no agreement and there’s still no text available.  I want to point out that we cannot simply wait until the very last minute to agree on a text, since we as a Parliament have to scrutinise the final text, in the same way as we have been scrutinising the entire negotiation process.  The United Kingdom will remain a close partner and ally of the European Union. For this reason we should use all our efforts to set the ground for fruitful cooperation beyond the end of the transition period. This will, colleagues, indeed require a certain degree of flexibility, creativity and pragmatism concerning our parliamentary procedures.  But to be very clear, we as the European Parliament will have the last word. To give our consent we need to receive the text as soon as possible. Nobody should underestimate the risks that a late submission entails for the orderly start of our new EU—UK relations.

We must strengthen health preparedness in the crisis. But we must also begin work to build a new future, a new sustainable economy for the future. We're not going to build the old economy. We're going to build the new green economy. The Green Deal and the Paris Agreement will be our road map for building europe's economy sustainable and for us to be able to give hope for the future.

Footballers are tired in injury time, but politicians are not. I think that politicians are at their best in injury time. I am still optimistic, because it’s in the interests of both to have this agreement.  On the rule of law, I want to simply echo what Luis Garicano and my colleague, Valerie Hayer, have said here in the debate. Ms Szydło, and Mr Zanni – sorry they are no longer here – can read the Treaty. The rule of law is not a question of subsidiarity, because that’s what they in fact are saying, that it’s a question of sovereignty. Freedom of expression, freedom of gathering, democracy, that is not a question of subsidiarity. Respect for the LGBT community in your country, that’s not a question of subsidiarity. That’s a value of the European Union, and that’s the reason we have to stick to the compromise we have found, even when I personally don’t think – and I’m grateful for the tenacity of Ms Merkel in still trying to find an agreement with Poland and Hungary – that there is a lot of room for compromise, because already in the text today you need to prove a link between the breach of the rule of law and the accounts of the European Union before the European Commission can act. So, if there is room for making it better, it’s to strengthen the system, not to weaken the system. If it is not possible – I repeat – there is only one way forward, which is enhanced cooperation inside the Treaty, based on Article 226 of the Treaty, like we did with the euro, like we did with Schengen and like we did with the European Patent. That is far better than to cave in to the blackmail of Orbán and Kaczyński.

If we are having a debate today in preparation for the European Council – 10 and 11 December – then allow me to single out two things that are of particular importance to me. The first point is the relationship between the European Union and Turkey. As you know, accession negotiations have been under way here since 2005. And instead of being able to make progress here at least by a metre, Turkey is moving in a completely wrong direction. You are all aware of the debate on the human rights situation, the lack of the rule of law, the lack of democracy. You are all familiar with the debate on the treatment of minorities, namely Kurds. You are all familiar with the discussion on Turkey's foreign policy activities, keywords conflict Nagorno-Karabakh, eastern Mediterranean, Iraq, Syria. Everywhere you have behaviour that is diametrically designed to form a kind of consensus of European interests. Moreover, do not forget that If Turkey were a Member State of the European Union, it would be an Islamic country, and so that the European Union would also sail under the Islamic flag, with a country that has the most inhabitants – a fundamentally wrong development. My approach would therefore be to speak clearly and finally to put an end to this accession process, instead of continuing these negotiations and giving hundreds of millions in euros and preparatory aid. A second point, which is also very important to me and which will perhaps bring about a debate at the Council meeting, is terrorism. In Austria, we had an ugly attack by an Islamist assassin at the beginning of November, resulting in four deaths and more than 20 serious injuries. If this European Union does not see itself as a western-style set of values and discourages this Islamism from being the whole thing, then the EU will also fail.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ID", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 31, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Marie TOUSSAINT", "mepid": "97236", "text": "   Madam President, the Council will meet after ten months of an unprecedented health crisis.

Since the wars we have not had as much need as we are now to be united and to work together, but neither have we made as much of an effort as we are now making to provide ourselves with funds, to provide us with European money that saves Europeans.

Next year, for the first time, we Europeans are going to give us money that is not going to come from any state, but from our pooled debt; but not the UK, because the UK next year is going to be out. The family is there for when you need it and so does the European Union, and now they're going to see how bad it is when you're alone. With no recovery fund, no single market if we don't reach an agreement and without Donald Trump, the UK can become a real economic island.

The question is how far our House can go with pragmatists. We have to be clear on one issue where there is no space for pragmatists: the Council decision of 25 February this year authorising the opening of these negotiations made it very explicit. It says that the negotiations of the envisaged partnership should be premised on the effective implementation of the Withdrawal Agreement and its three protocols. Full and timely implementation of this agreement is fundamental for us here. We hope to hear again soon from Vice-President Maroš Šefčovič on this.

Every intention that works in the opposite direction is a historic mistake and is a sign of political weakness. We will not succumb to this. The fact that Prime Ministers Orbán and Morawiecki got so hysterical about this probably demonstrates that we are on the right track because, if the rule of law is as much in order in these countries as they claim, then why do they hate their citizens so much to deprive them of the recovery money in times of crisis, alongside so many other millions of Europeans?  Let’s make something clear: this is not an east-west divide, it is not about a bizarre global conspiracy theory, it’s not an anti-Hungarian coup and it’s not an anti-Polish machination,  because what can be more pro—Hungarian or pro—Polish than standing up for the money that belongs to the citizens to get where it really has to be - to the small businesses, to the local communities - and not into the pockets of autocrats or members of Viktor Orbán’s family? It is not about Christianity either. Last time I checked, stealing is against the Bible too, so let’s keep that in mind.  One last thing, let me say to those on the right in this House and to the Conservatives in the Council: please stop appeasing European autocrats. It’s not working and you are making a huge mistake here. Please stand on the side of the people and on the side of European values. After so long, you have a historic chance to do that.

In recent weeks, Islamist terrorism has hit Europe hard again. He knocked in Paris, he struck in Nice, he struck in Vienna and the terrorists did not come from here. They entered the continent without difficulty, then crossed unhindered the borders that separate the European countries, which were supposed to be strengthened in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. In its 25 years of existence, the Schengen area has shown its indigence in the face of each of the crises we have gone through. Europe has been unable to stem the migrant crisis of 2016: the Schengen system placing the full weight of controlling migration flows on countries of entry into the EU, already hard hit by an economic crisis. The Schengen system has not protected us from the terrorism crisis. Nor has it protected us from the health crisis, while elsewhere in the world, from Asia to New Zealand, it is the countries that have closed their borders very early on that have withstood the epidemic best. Today, Europe continues to flee forward. The European Commission is proposing a pact on migration that will jeopardise the continent's demographic stability and MEPs are calling for an immediate return to the open borders of Schengen in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Faced with this ideological stubbornness, European heads of state must now decide on the suspension of the Schengen agreements.

We need to give Europol a stronger mandate and more resources. We need a European anti-terrorism prosecutor. The European databases we have or put in place need to be better informed and communicated with each other. There is an urgent need to better secure our external borders, freedom of movement in Europe does not apply to terrorists, radicalised Islamists or arms traffickers. To all of us, the Commission, the Council, Parliament, I ask us to take our responsibilities to ensure that the regulation on the removal of terrorist content online is adopted quickly and that we commit ourselves without weakness to combating hateful content on the internet.

Professor Samuel Paty, the faithful of Notre-Dame de Nice, the recent victims of the Vienna attack were not victims of a vague anonymous extremism, but of a clear ideology: Islamism. And naming things is not superfluous, it is the condition to be able to finally act effectively because, in order to put an end to terrorism, we will obviously have to improve our cooperation in security and justice, but we must finally agree to fight an ideological battle. Islamism attacks what Europe has too often given up defending: our civilization, our principles, a certain way of living, deliberating and transmitting. In short, all the police in Europe, despite their dedication, will not prevent violence from striking if we have done nothing upstream to combat the grip of this ideology, especially among the youngest. The Commission really wants to be reduced to sending its condolences, attack after attack? So there is no point in indignanting in the vacuum against violent extremism, we must start by no longer being complicit in this ideology, by stopping funding associations inspired by the Muslim Brotherhood that spread, with European funds, the hatred that will make other innocent victims tomorrow, by stopping subsidizing Islamist leaders, like Erdogan, when he is still attacking by stopping turning a blind eye - and I turn to you, ladies and gentlemen, in this Parliament which says it is so attached to the rule of law - that in many parts of our countries, the leaden cloak of a fundamentalist Islam has replaced the authority of our democracies. We must put an end to our denial of migration, so many attacks would have been avoided if no one had been able to enter Europe if it had not been legally allowed.

Turkey did not take advantage of the window of opportunity given to it by the European Union to sit at the table for dialogue with Greece, instead continuing its aggressive behaviour in the Aegean. Erdoğan himself has ostentatiously violated United Nations resolutions with his visit to Varoshi. Turkey is serially violating the rules of the rule of law. Turkey is insulting our values by turning Hagia Sophia, the World Heritage Site, into a mosque. Turkey is violating the peace operation to monitor the embargo on Libya. Turkey is violating and demonstrating its strength in Nagorno Karabakh, violating international legitimacy and ultimately believes that the European Union will not deliver on its warnings. Will the European Union stay in the words? Will he succumb to the attack of friendship of the last twenty-four hours, when there are already scenarios that bring Erdoğan ready to annex occupied Cyprus?  Will the European Union give such a window of opportunity to Erdoğan who appears as an official trespasser of international legitimacy, not only in the Eastern Mediterranean, but also in the Caucasus? It is very important to understand this: by postponing decisions on sanctions on Turkey, the European Union is not only undermining the course of Greece and Cyprus.

A recent report by the Tactics Institute for Security and Counter Terrorism, the UK-based research organisation, publicly presents worrying facts: technological transactions of know-how between the West and third countries, which use them against their opponents to subvert democracy. Examples include the UAE's infrastructure and internal surveillance program, DREAD, which has been used to monitor Saudi women's rights activists, UN diplomats, FIFA staff and political and human rights activists. Other examples are project Travel and project Karma. The first helped the United Arab Emirates identify political opposition to the monarchy; the second developed iPhone violation features. Activists, diplomats and rival foreign leaders from the Middle East have been targeted with malware spread via mobile phones, or by email or remotely. We must recognise that many totalitarian regimes use these weapons. Some prefer to be part of the Western Internet ecosystem, engaging directly or by proxy to undermine transparency and privacy, to outline their digital sovereignty while maintaining the economic benefits of connectivity. Authoritarian regimes can become so efficient and sophisticated in suppressing opposition with information technology that they do not have to resort to brutal coercion. They may even appear benign in the eyes of world public opinion. The European Union should then concern itself with the export of knowledge and technology, with strict restrictions, as well as the export of conventional weapons.

And the same goes for the respect of the withdrawal agreement, which must be implemented as agreed and on time, and here I would say, Deal or No Deal. Peace and prosperity on the island of Ireland is of paramount importance and the respect for the Good Friday Agreement is absolute, and I really would like to assure of that Mr Kelleher who made this point very clearly. To respond to Ms Hübner in greater detail, I would like to tell her that if it comes to the withdrawal agreement we are also working around the clock on proper and timely implementation of this agreement. I’m glad that I can pass the good message to the 4.5 million citizens of the European Union in the United Kingdom concerning their residence rights, because here we are working very hard and I believe that for sure we will solve this issue. I am in frequent contact with Mr Gove. I would not hide that the negotiations are difficult, but I appreciate the constructive atmosphere and I hope that it will help us to adopt all the necessary decisions of the Joint Committee which are due before the end of the year.  Here again, we are also in the endgame and I’m looking for having the Joint Committee meeting in the next days and I really would like to use it as a decisive one to find a solution on all outstanding issues, especially on the proper implementation of the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland, and we are fully aware of the scrutiny requirements by this House, and by the Council. The Commission President told you this morning that we don’t know if we reach a deal with the United Kingdom or not, but I can assure you that we will do our maximum, our utmost, but we will not accept a deal at any price. The next days will be absolutely decisive and therefore I would like to underscore how much we appreciate the European Parliament’s readiness to hold an extraordinary session for proper assessment of the eventual deal. We will continue the close cooperation with you and with this House on this issue and we will respect to the fullest the transparency which was established in this process because we know that this is how we can earn your trust which is so important for all of us.  Many of you address the issue of multiannual financial perspective and the NextGenerationEU instrument, and I would say that an overwhelming majority of honourable Members, most of the leaders of the political groups, have been a very clear. In this unprecedented crisis we need the firepower, the novelty of this new financial structure to tackle the crisis, to restart the economy, to save lives and jobs, and to modernise our economies. I can assure you that for the European Commission, the rule of law is part of the deal and the European values are not negotiable. And I would like to assure you that the Commission will be working relentlessly with you, with the Council, with the German Presidency, to resolve the situation which is becoming very grave and to make sure that the European Union and our citizens will have the necessary financial means to perform our duties as of the beginning of the next year. Ms García Pérez, Mr Eickhout, Ms Van Brempt and Mr Picula referred to the importance of vaccination. I have to say that thanks to the advanced negotiations and prepayment to the pharmaceutical companies it’s very important to say that we will have enough doses of vaccines for all of the European Union citizens, and we are not thinking about them only because we make sure that we want to develop the mechanisms how the citizens of the world can benefit from this very important vaccine because only in that way would we be able to tackle finally the COVID-19 pandemic. If it comes to the vaccination we already asked the Member States to develop their vaccination strategies and we also issued a recommendation how we believe they should be developed for the orderly and fair process of the vaccination of our citizens. The next financial perspective and NextGenerationEU will have to focus on achieving our very ambitious Green Deal on our ambitious goals in the area of the digital agenda. Ms Keller, Ms Bonafè and Ms Cseh were actually highlighting the importance of the climate discussion and climate targets which have to be assessed and we believe positively decided upon by the leaders in the next European Council. Your calls for clarity is the same what we hear from investors, from business leaders, from our citizens, that we need the clear deal coming from the European Council meeting on climate goals to put into the higher gear our efforts to reach the ‘fit for 55’ agenda. The good news is that very soon we will have a strong ally in the United States in fighting climate change. The initial contacts of President-elect Biden with Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, but also with other European leaders, and the track record of Mr Blinken, Mr Kerry, whom I know personally, is an absolute guarantee that the United States and the European Union will work hand-in-hand if it comes to the importance of tackling climate change. And to conclude, a quick response to Ms Loiseau and Mr Bellamy who raised the issue of counter-terrorism. On 9 December the Commission will present an EU agenda on counter-terrorism. It will set out the EU counter-terrorism strategy for the next four years, setting out new measures to better anticipate, prevent, protect and respond to the terrorist threat. It will include a strategic approach to respond more effectively and with innovative approaches to radicalisation. But we should also not forget that Member States need to implement the current framework and that it is high time to agree and adopt the proposal on terrorist content online.  In addition to that, in December, the Commission plans to adopt a revised mandate for Europol, as well as proposals on critical infrastructure and network information security. The Commission also included in the next year’s work programme a new agenda on counter-terrorism that will set out the new measures to counter radicalisation and terrorism.  Madam President, I really would like to thank all the honourable Members for a really very rich debate covering all the important topics which are on the European agenda. I very much appreciate the support, the clarity of the message and I really thank you for the floor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 87, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Roberta METSOLA", "mepid": "118859", "text": "", "language": "en", "original_language": "sq", "translation_provider": "", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 88, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Clara AGUILERA", "mepid": "125045", "text": "  in writing. – The most relevant discussions were the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, counter-terrorism and violent extremism, situation in the Eastern Mediterranean and relations with Turkey, EU relations with Southern Neighbourhood countries, EU trade policy.

It is a shame that today's Hungary, the illiberal mafia state of Orban, would no longer be included in this European club. It is a shame that the people's party community of the founding fathers is still cowardly assisting in the illiberal rampage and it will be a historic crime if the Heads of State or Government stab the European Parliament, which is representing the will of nearly 450 million European citizens, and finally make a deal with the mobsters. It's a visceral law not to negotiate with political hostage takers.  I wonder how much Angela Merkel's support for Orban in the German car industry is worth, or whether it is another chunky and unnecessary Hungarian military order. It is worth it for the independence of the Hungarian judiciary to be eroded; that the public media can demonstrably lie to political control and gradually abolish the rule of law?

Many things have happened since I last addressed this House on the Istanbul Convention and violence against women. Since March, the world has changed. The number of cases of gender-based violence, violence against women and, in particular, domestic violence, has been on the rise. This is what we know because, as we know, this is one of the most under-reported crimes.  The strict confinement that many of us have been experiencing led to heightened exposure of women and children to domestic violence and abuse.  Home is not a safe space for everyone, especially not during lockdown. Anyone can experience domestic and intimate partner violence, but the majority of victims are women, and children, by witnessing violence, are being targeted directly.  This trend is extremely worrying, in particular as a second wave of confinement rules has been introduced in many countries. We must do all that we can to prevent domestic violence, protect its victims and punish offenders. We have taken a commitment in the EU Gender Equality Strategy, concluding that the EU’s accession to the Istanbul Convention is a key priority for the Commission since the Convention is the benchmark for international legislation on tackling gender-based violence.  As requested by the Parliament, the European Court of Justice is currently assessing the compatibility with the EU treaties of the Council signing decision and adoption procedure. The Court’s Opinion will be delivered in the second quarter of 2021. Should the EU’s accession subsequently remain blocked, the Commission will propose, in 2021, a legal initiative to prevent and combat violence against women in order to reach the same objectives as the Istanbul Convention. But we also need to act quickly to ensure a high level of protection and adequate specialised support services across Europe. Women should not be afraid to report cases of violence, nor should there be a fear of revictimisation. We must also counter the rising trend and prevent violence from happening. Last week, on the initiative of the German Presidency, the 27 EU Ministers for Gender Equality reiterated their strong commitment and support in strengthening and improving actions on combating gender-based violence and violence against women.  I am encouraged by these developments as the Commission shares the Ministers’ determination to prevent and combat gender-based violence. We will also need your strong support for our legal proposal on violence against women. As co-legislator, you will have a key role in making this happen. Additionally, as announced in our different equality strategies, we will present an initiative to extend the list of Euro crimes to hate speech and hate crime.  I am also here to call for your support to defend our common values. Gender equality is a core value of the European Union and a principle we will keep fighting for. I will continue to stress that the Istanbul Convention is the gold standard in terms of policy in this area and I will continue to facilitate a better understanding of its aim and provisions. The European Parliament has consistently taken a strong stance on the issue of violence against women, and has repeatedly called for EU accession to the Istanbul Convention and for its ratification by individual Member States. I count on your continuous support for the work ahead of us.

Every day, women in Europe are murdered because of the violence they suffer from their partner. COVID—19 has put many people in a very difficult situation. It has also become a dangerous outcome for those women who are being trapped in their violent relationships during lockdown. Across Europe, violence in close relationships has increased dramatically during this crisis, and we must increase our forces to put an end to this now. The Istanbul Convention is the first binding international instrument on preventing and combating violence against women. It’s a strong and necessary tool for protecting women from all types of violence, but unfortunately the Convention and the fight against violence against women is under attack by a great deal of unfair disinformation. Some say, ‘Oh, the Convention supports destructive gender ideology’; others say, ‘Oh, the Convention will introduce a third sex’; some more say, ‘Oh, but we don’t need this Convention, we already have legislation’. But this is untrue, this is false, and these are myths, because even in my own country, Sweden – which is considered to be at the forefront when it comes to gender equality – violence against women is a serious problem and the Istanbul Convention is a very important tool for national and local legislation and the judiciary. So it has a big impact in combating these kinds of crimes. The Istanbul Convention is about guaranteeing fundamental human rights also for women, and the perpetrators that are beating, abusing or killing their partners must be put behind bars. How can one even be against that? I don’t understand. This is why ratifying this Convention is so important. The victims of violence have no time for more excuses. As legislators we must do all we can to protect victims and to end the increasing violence now. We have the responsibility to fight for women’s rights, for their freedom, for their safety, the basic right not to be beaten, not to be raped, not to be murdered. An important step towards this is that every EU Member State and the EU itself should ratify the Istanbul Convention and that violence against women should be an EU crime.

Silence has been over the centuries the greatest accomplice of violence against women and girls. That is why silence and isolation from confinement have caused violence against women to have increased. Some data tell us that complaints have declined, that court proceedings and protective orders have declined, but violence has increased, because phone calls to victims' special phones have increased. The women and girls in their homes, together with their aggressor, have called and whispered to us to help them. That is why today, this 25 November, I think it is important that the victims get a very clear message: the European Parliament, the European Union is with them, they are not alone. And, as we are with them, from this Parliament we demand, once again, the Member States which have not ratified the Istanbul Convention, to do so: Latvia, Lithuania, Slovakia, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic and Hungary, ratify already!. And, to Poland, we say that it cannot withdraw from the one Convention, the only international legal instrument we have to combat gender-based violence, because it is the heart of the rule of law, which is precisely where the fundamental rights of victims are located.

Our duty is to stand up for women.  Violence against women is a violation of fundamental human rights. It is the most drastic form of gender-based discrimination. Equality between women and men is one of the fundamental values of the European Union. We create smart cities, produce autonomous cars, we fly into space, but at the same time there are women in Europe who cannot feel safe in their own homes. They live in fear, they fear for their health and life. Many women do not report violence to the police. They are ashamed. They do not trust the state. They hear that these are family matters. The time of COVID-19 is special. The scale of domestic violence has increased. There are still countries in the European Union that call the fight for women’s rights an ideology. They use tradition, religion and protection of family as an excuse. There are countries in the European Union that have still not ratified the Convention. We have countries that want to denounce the Convention.  A year ago, we gave the Commission a clear signal. We called on the Commission to include violence against women in the catalogue of EU-recognised crimes. A year ago, we called for the ratification of the Istanbul Convention but 12 months have passed and nothing has happened. We jointly criticised governments that ignore the European Parliament’s resolutions, but sometimes the Commission does the same thing: it ignores European Parliament resolutions. Dear colleagues, let me remind you that the President-elect of the European Commission promised us all of this over a year ago in Strasbourg. While it turned up with nice words, how long will women in the European Union wait for equality, safety and the right to dignity?

Following the very important intention of protecting victims of domestic violence, it introduces the concept of the gender perspective. It literally says that \"the structural nature of violence against women is gender-based.\" I mean, the woman's a victim because she's a woman. And, therefore, that man for being a man is a mistreater. This conditions permanent suspicion against man. But the man does not rape, he does it a rapist; man does not kill, kills a murderer; man does not mistreat, he does it a mistreater; man does not humiliate, humiliates a coward. This only confronts men and women and also destroys the fundamental right of equality and non-discrimination. Attacking this foundation ends our judicial systems, as has happened in Spain, where an unfair law of gender-based violence has stripped the male of another fundamental right such as the presumption of innocence, determining in advance his guilt. It has also given women a supremacy that has rarefied relationships in our environment, blurring what is criminal and what is not. For example, today it is a crime to say a compliment. As you can see, it's a poisoned gift that doesn't help victims of violence and does break our society. Don't be fooled.

We have all learned to grow with his reflexes of self-defense, the only answers that our patriarchal society has given us. But do you really know how we feel? Today, I want to tell you our rage, that of women who can no longer suffer violence from the streets to our homes, in public space or intimacy, including here in the European Parliament. Suffer macho remarks, walking hands and be silent for fear of losing his job. Feeling a body you do not want, being considered a vulgar object, being forced, raped, sometimes by a stranger, but much more often by a spouse, father or friend. And to suffer in his flesh the violence of a sex that one does not want. Feeling dirty, humiliated and still being silent for fear of not being believed, ashamed, feeling guilty: double punishment. And like so many women, hear from the one who was chosen first criticisms, then insults, ever more frequent, and then the first slaps, isolation, stigmas on the body, suffocated, paralyzed with fear, pain, not being able to flee, see death approach, the beatings more and more violent to those who kill. These femicides, all too often described by the media as a crime of passion. Life torn away for the mere fact of being a woman. Since January, 86 of them in France have been killed at the hands of their spouses or ex-spouses, and even more in the whole of the European Union. They're our mothers, our sisters, our friends. I would like their name to resonate loudly in this Chamber, even if, for that, Madam President, I must exceed my speaking time and be interrupted. If neither our testimonies nor our rage inspire you to act, then I hope that this morbid count of those lives that we should have saved will compel you to do so.

Certainly even one death is one death too many. This goes to show how much more we still have to do in order to eradicate this scourge from all our societies. No society is free from the scourge of violence against women. Again, I reiterate my thanks for your support for everything we are attempting to do to combat this reality. As Pina Picierno rightly pointed out, this is barbarism versus civilisation. She put it exactly as it is because what you have demonstrated, Manon, is barbarism. It’s not civilisation. As Pina also pointed out, this is about men. When we speak among ourselves here, among women, we are speaking to the converted. We all know what the problem is. Some of us are victims. So it would have been good had we had some male speakers during this session, but I am sure that they are listening and I am sure that there are many men – I know many men – who want to fight this. But, as I said, it would have been good had they been vocal about it in this particular session. And, yes, as María Soraya Rodríguez Ramos put it, silence is complicity. So at no point must we stop working on this reality. Sylwia Spurek, I said that we are working on the ratification and simultaneously we are working on legislation. As you know, we are committed to this and this is in our Gender Equality Strategy, which we presented last March. So of course we are committed to this and we shall keep our promise, but obviously we also need your support.  Again, as Manon Aubry said, gender-based violence is not only about being physically beaten by your partner. There are many other forms of violence which some women don’t even realise, like the examples you mentioned –this is violence against you. There could be psychological violence, there could be financial violence and there could be other things, which the Me Too movement has highlighted and worked upon. The world started to realise then that many things happen in life to women and that women don’t speak up. Until they did speak up, which is a good thing, but of course there’s so much that we have to do in this area of policy.  We are committed. We will keep our promise. We have been saying how this year has been a challenging year, especially for women facing violence. I therefore count on this Parliament’s support to put in place an instrument that helps prevent violence against women and domestic violence, protects victims and prosecutes perpetrators. There is no time, nor any excuse, to roll back on gender equality and on women’s rights.  I thank you again for your participation in this debate today and I thank you heartily for your support. I know that you are with us on this and we shall continue fighting until we don’t come here to this Parliament with lists of women who have been killed in these situations.

Interestingly, and apart from the little pinches of “gender” ideology proposed by article 3/b of the Convention, studies are showing that it falls short of attaining its goals. For instance: Just in Sweden, the National Council on Crime Prevention reported that the number of people killed in domestic violence doubled between 2017 and 2018. Belgian Interior Minister Pieter De Crem also denounced an increase in domestic violence during the same period, in other words before victims were locked in with their abusive partners because of confinement measures.

The increase in violence against women in Europe is mainly linked to immigration from certain countries of origin and regions. For example, a study by the Federal Criminal Police Office in November 2019 on partnership violence pointed out that in the categories of murder, manslaughter, sexual assault, rape, pimping and forced prostitution, the proportion of non-German perpetrators is significantly higher than the proportion of foreigners in the total population of Germany. Immigration is confronting us with an image of women that has nothing to do with equal treatment and non-violent relationships. Researchers in Beirut pointed to the link between violence against women and societal factors such as the lack of political and economic participation of women, discriminatory legal systems and impunity for violence against women and girls. In some Middle Eastern countries, 70 percent of women are victims of sexual violence. In this way, social progress becomes impossible. A 2019 survey conducted by the Ministry of Social Affairs in Morocco found that about 54 percent of all women experience violence.

The Commission attaches great importance to freedom of expression, media pluralism and freedom of the media in the EU Member States as well as in the EU candidate countries and potential candidates. Free and pluralistic media is essential to democracy. It helps citizens hold to account those in power and allow them to make informed electoral choices and fend off disinformation and attempts to manipulate the democratic debate and interfere in elections. It also helps ensure that a plurality of views can be expressed and heard in the democratic debate. This is why the Commission will include measures to strengthen media freedom and pluralism in the upcoming European democracy action plan, alongside measures targeted to fighting disinformation and ensure free and fair elections.  While the measures presented in the action plan will in a large proportion address threats to democracy in the EU, the plan will also have a strong international dimension. The Commission already supports media freedom and pluralism through a variety of initiatives within the scope of its competences. The media pluralism monitor, drawn up by the independent Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom and co-financed by the Commission, examines threats and risks to media pluralism in the EU and selected candidate countries and potential candidates. Media freedom and pluralism is also part of the Commission’s annual rule of law report. The 2020 report adopted in September covers all 27 Member States, including Hungary and Slovenia. The report examines a number of issues relevant for media freedom and pluralism, including transparency of media ownership, state advertising and political control of the media.  Concerning North Macedonia, the Commission and the EU delegation are following the developments in the media sector in the country very closely. The Commission reports on these issues in its regular enlargement packages, including in its latest 2020 report on North Macedonia. This report assessed that greater transparency on media ownership and possible illegal media concentration is required.  In accordance with the division of competences between the European Union and its Member States, matters regarding the application of electoral laws are the responsibility of the Member State authorities and it is for the competent national administrative and judicial authorities to ensure compliance with applicable EU law and relevant standards. As a part of the electoral package issued by the Commission in September 2018, the Commission asked the Member States, in line with their applicable rules, to encourage and facilitate the transparency of paid online political advertisements and communications. National and European political parties, foundations and campaign organisations were asked to provide such transparency. The law in many Member States, including Slovenia and Hungary, regulates transparency in campaigning.  Concerning the online platforms’ role, the major online platforms that are signatories to the self-regulatory code of practice on disinformation have committed to provide transparency and public disclosure around online political advertising.  Democracy is a common value of the European Union. The functioning itself of our Union is founded on the principle of representative democracy. Elections in Europe shall be conducted according to the highest democratic standards. You can count on the Commission’s vigilance on these important matters in line with our competence. The aim will be to counter disinformation and to adapt to evolving threats and manipulations, as well as to support free and independent media.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 129, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Romana TOMC", "mepid": "125104", "text": "  Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, i would like to thank the Commission for your – Dear Sirs! We are talking about an issue that is asked solely for the purpose of interfering in internal affairs and discrediting the Slovenian Government. It is absurd to do so that it is based on information from a cyber-organised Slovenian web portal with suspicious and opaque ownership, known for attacks on the centre-right government and by journalists who have already been indicted at the press honorary tribunal. In Slovenia, we have serious problems with the media space, which has been completely unbalanced for thirty years. Monopolies, which have formed in all areas, from the economy to the judiciary and the media, during this time, are in the hands of the left. This prevents democratic processes in the country from being realised. A particular problem is national radio-television, which you would expect to be independent, but unfortunately that is not the case. The dominant media in Slovenia accounts for 90% of the media space. Those in Slovenian ownership are in the hands of the left tycoon elite, which through them implements the political agenda. And their power is extraordinary. With a few bright exceptions, objective journalism in Slovenia is unfortunately a myth. They don't write stories that don't fit. There is a lot of cover-up and biased reporting, which is why those few non-left and independent media are really important to Slovenia. The European Commission also notes a great lack of transparency in ownership. Changes are therefore necessary and do not mean the destruction of independent media. On the contrary, they are an attempt to make the media space better, more independent, transparent and balanced. Unfortunately, this is precisely the case that is an obvious demonstration of how even in the European Parliament Slovenian socialists are abusing the media for political struggle. I will be treated by two former Slovenian journalists who have extensive experience with an unbalanced media space.

If it is true that Hungarian companies are close to the closeest circle of Hungarian Prime Minister Orban, talking about €4 million, financing media purchases in North Macedonia in the run-up to the elections in support of the former Macedonian prime minister Gruevski, who later gained asylum in Hungary, this can be a rough interference with the country's democratic processes. Half a million Hungarian money is also alleged to have come from the accounts of two Slovenian media outlets close to this currently ruling SDS. The remittances were investigated by a parliamentary commission, but unfortunately the government was replaced and the investigation was halted.

Just yesterday, we discussed here that the state of media freedom in the Union has deteriorated. And it is precisely most of the issues raised yesterday, in fact, we can see in the case of Hungarian interference in the media in North Macedonia and Slovenia. Moreover, it is no longer a secret that the Slovenian Government is trying – without the mandate of the public – to reash Slovenia into an iliberal society. Modeled on Orban, how much.  Attacks on the public media, undermining their funding and running a parallel partisan media landscape, which, on top of that, are clearly funded by Orban's circle, are just three of many attempts to usury power by methods that violate the Union's core values.  The Commission should therefore, in my view, also monitor many of our government's other moves, because the actions of the largest party are essentially growing into a union-wide problem. I think that we are all aware of this here, as we are also aware that in the past the Union has naively delayed action for too long until one such problem has got out of control.

Today's debate illustrates the chasm that now separates citizens from Member States from their elites. Indeed, its purpose boils down to a collection of specious allegations relating to certain North Macedonian media financed by Hungarian personalities and the promotion that would be made up of brands of olive oil or magnets for fridges. This is what the European institution is reduced to, determined to make fire of all wood to corner the government of Viktor Orban. In reality, the latter is guilty in their view only of having opposed an end to the reception of migrants and vetoed the European budget in response to the inequitous principle of conditionality. This discussion on a subject of no interest to our fellow citizens is deftly diverting attention from the real time bomb of the senseless enlargement project in the Balkans, particularly Albania and Northern Macedonia. For the interference that we should denounce in this case is not that allegedly practised by Hungary for the benefit of a conservative North Macedonian party, no, it is that of Tirana, who, with the base of some 25% of Albanians in Northern Macedonia, seems to be patiently weaving the web of Greater Albania. It is also the one implemented by Turkey with great cooperation in the military and political fields, notably through its affinity with the pro-Albanian Movement Besa, but also educational and cultural. This is evidenced by Ankara's project of history textbooks for Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Northern Macedonia, which are strongly or predominantly Muslim countries. A significant example of the rewrites of neo-Ottoman history that flourish in the wake of Sultan Erdogan, while Europe is called upon to repent of its colonial past. But it is also and above all the interference of associations with the charitable façade that, coming from Saudi Arabia, Qatar, or Even Pakistan, crisscrossed the country from the moment of its independence, while the so-called Islamic Youth Forum, emanating from the Muslim Brotherhood, has always been on the street in its capital, Skopje. Radical Islam is also driven by the surge in migration. A report published by the European Parliament denounced, as early as 2012, the infiltration of Islamist militants via the Balkan route, as well as the radicalisation of children within the diaspora of these states, which are based in the European Union and, according to the report, in Austria. A warning that freezes the blood, since it recalls the profile of the Islamist terrorist shot in November in Vienna, an Albanian from Northern Macedonia. The Commission cannot pretend to ignore the considerable risks it exposes Europeans at a time when the Balkan countries, a region of Europe where the concentration of jihadists returning from Syria or Iraq is the highest, are the only ones to voluntarily and publicly repatriate men affiliated with the Islamic State and held by Kurdish forces, according to a reference source. And by inserting itself, in spite of common sense, in its plan to extend to States affiliated with Turkey from Erdogan, it will bear sole responsibility.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 133, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Tineke STRIK", "mepid": "197772", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Mr President, this morning in this House, many of us made clear that if Hungary can continue to violate the rules and the values of our Treaty and enjoy impunity, breaches of the rule of law will spread throughout the European Union.

Another big Slovenian paper is owned partially by Austrians, and one of its commercial TV channels is now in Czech hands. Or let me tell you that RTL Klub, a popular TV channel in Hungary, is owned entirely by the German RTL Group. Believe it or not, 80% of regional papers in Poland and 60% of the print media in Croatia are also in German hands. Doesn’t this give you a hard time sleeping at night? Well, it should not.

There are problems with the media in Slovenia, therefore. The vast majority, especially the mainstream media, are left-leaning. It cannot be argued that in Slovenia the media space is balanced and plural. Investment in new media can, however, increase media pluralism and the independence of journalists, who today often write after the dictatorship of the advertising clique and left political elites, who often do not even hide sympathies with old and surviving communication patterns. In short, the media sphere is asymmetrical. And on the left, they will do anything to keep it that way, because it allows them to control the media space.

I will first reply on the comments addressed to the Commission. This Commission does everything to support an independent, professional and trustworthy media because, more than ever before, we need objective news which will inform citizens about the situation. We have to do it and we are doing everything with the competences we have.  Concrete steps on the concrete situation is always a matter of a thorough analysis as to whether this is against EU rules and whether we have the instruments to take concrete steps which will address an individual case. You know the system very well. We work on individual cases, which can be addressed by enquiry into infringements – which is not this case – and we can work by adopting new legislation, or proposing new legislation, to address systemic issues. This is what we are doing. We now have the Audiovisual Media Services Directive already being transposed into national laws. We are scrutinising whether it is done in full because, if not, we have to launch an infringement against the Member State and ask for an improvement in the implementation or application of the European Directive in national law. This is now ongoing because this Directive came into force this year. We are preparing very thoroughly for the application date of the Copyright Directive, which will come next year in June. It will be a very important moment in history for strengthening the position of professional journalism because, behind this heavily lobbied piece of legislation – I think you will remember the time when this was in the final stage of adoption – there was a very simple idea, namely that professional journalists have to get paid for their work.  This is going to come into force next year in June and the Commission is prepared to help with proper implementation in the Member States, which will not be possible to circumvent. We have already seen in France that an effort was made by Google to find some middle way solution, and we said no. It has to be implemented and applied in full.  We are going to adopt the European Democracy Action Plan and the Media Action Plan next week, on 2 December. I will not go into details because of the time limit here, but you will see that in everything we are doing – by the current legislation which is already in application or the rules we are going to adopt – we are trying to strengthen the position of independent media because we need the independent and professional media to be strong and do their job. The character of their job is twofold. One is that they are economic actors. What we see now, in the time of COVID, is the more we need professional and objective media, the less money they get. They are in horrible financial distress now in the time of COVID. That’s why we recommended to the Member States to use the state aid schemes also to help the media as economic players and employers. The second task of the media, and an indispensable role, is that they must remain strong watchdogs of democracy. They must hold us, who are in power, under control. We are also working in this direction. You will see in the European Democracy Action Plan that we will propose several actions to strengthen their position as the watchdogs of democracy. I will always emphasise professional independent trustworthy media. This is what we are speaking about.  And why? Why are we trying to strengthen the position of the media? Because we see clearly that when the media are weak, they are easy targets for political and economic pressure. This is what we see in Europe. The trend is worsening. In the summer this year, we published the Media Pluralism Monitor, where we saw this very clearly. A worsening trend of political pressure on the media has increased everywhere in Europe. Economic pressure, now made more dramatic by the impact of COVID, has made the situation of the media very difficult. Advertisers have moved to the online sphere and 50% of all advertising money goes to Facebook and Google in Europe. This is the reality. When the media are hungry, then they have no other choice than to take the money from those who want to impose the political agenda. This is what we are witnessing in many cases. So we need to do everything we can – this is for me a systemic measure – to make the media stronger and not to be driven into this financial trap because they of course need to make money doing their job. We have a very vivid dialogue with media organisations because we also want the EU money to help, but of course we cannot pay individual media because we have to respect the independence of the media. I will finish by asking all of us to try to look at things objectively. The EU is, of course, supporting the media, which is also financed by foreign actors when they operate as business players. But when we see that there is a political agenda behind that, then there is something wrong.  Thank you very much for this debate. I do not believe that this was the last debate about the media. This was a geographically—specific one, but it also revealed the systemic issues we are facing and that we are trying to solve at European Union level because we have a limit to systemic functioning solutions, including the increase in transparency of ownership. This is one of the things which we now want to scrutinise in more depth because this is one of the conditions which are already in the Audiovisual Media Services Directive, which is now in force.

You also know – we all do – that high—quality sexual and reproductive health services are essential to women and girls. This includes access to contraception, prevention and treatment of HIV and other sexually—transmitted diseases, and fertility and sex—specific cancers, and access to abortion.  From a legal perspective, it is clear that the EU has no competence on abortion rights within a Member State. Legislation in this area is up to the Member State concerned. I will state factually that the recent decision by the Polish Constitutional Tribunal has restricted Poland’s abortion law. As you know, in the Article 7 procedure launched by the Commission in 2017, we raised concerns over the independence and legitimacy of the Polish Constitutional Tribunal. As recalled in the 2020 Rule of Law Report, these concerns have so far not been resolved.  In the weeks following the Polish Constitutional Tribunal’s decision, we have seen how many Polish citizens have taken to the streets – civil society, women and men protested in Poland – and I wholeheartedly hope that these voices are being heard and listened to.  Strong women’s rights are an asset and an achievement which the whole of Europe must be proud of. But progress is hard won and easily lost, and we see this in Europe and worldwide. As President von der Leyen said: backsliding is not an option for a continent that aims to win the future.

A party that seeks to sabotage the very institutions that built a democratic Poland, that sought to oppose guiding principles after the fall of communism, where once the Solidarity movement took to the streets amidst a tidal wave of support for fundamental values. Now a pitiful government cowers behind Mr Kaczyński as he tries to tear down the very essence of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  And yet, as the poet from my own country, Seamus Heaney, would say: the longed-for tidal wave of justice can rise up. And where the spirit of the Solidarity movement rose up in the 1980s, so too does the spirit rise up again today, and it can be seen on the streets in cities across Poland – Warsaw, Gdańsk, Kraków, Poznań and others. The great spirit of Polish women can be seen on the streets again. From the country that gave the world women like Marie-Skłodowska Curie, Wisława Szymborska and Edith Stein, once again, Polish women are rising up and indeed inspiring the world and the autocrats and the strong-man politicians better watch out.

And in the face of this situation of injustice, this Parliament must manifest itself as it is done on the streets full of men and women in Poland by claiming the freedom and rights of women.

Eighteen years ago, my wife and I faced a difficult decision. We had welcomed our ninth child, and the ultrasound had diagnosed a neck fold. Should we let the amniotic fluid test be done now or not? We decided against it, because an abortion would never have been an option for us, and Paul was born healthy. For the curious among you: God also entrusted us with a tenth child. Ten years after this birth of Paul, I was for the first time at a demo, at the March for Life in Berlin – against abortion. There I met them, these lucky charms, these joyful people with trisomy 21, Down syndrome. They reported from their lives, their profession or from school and how much they loved their parents for allowing them to live. Nowhere have I seen so much contagious cheerfulness and light-heartedness as on these demos for life. But unfortunately – behind the police cordons – nowhere has so much hatred and enmity against the beautiful, the good, the selfless and the holy. And now we want to rebuke and condemn the Poles for saying 'yes' to life, because they are committed to their Christian roots? They are fighting for one of the greatest assets that our human rights declarations and constitutions want to protect: for human life. Poland is right to object to abortion being made a human right by means of the detour of protecting sexual health. Even the ECJ defined the result of merging a male sperm cell with a female egg as human life many years ago, and we now want to criticise the Poles for respecting a person's right to life more than our selfish rights to self-determination?

Even the former Members of the Court judged that the Court could not have ruled otherwise in this case.

It is not the only government, dozens of countries, and the United States, have signed such a shameful anti-abortion declaration. This is another blow to the rights of young women and couples. The Polish government's aim is a total ban, pushing more women into illegal abortion, rewarding the commercialisation of health, reinforcing anachronistic views on the role of women. Moreover, it is an example of alignment with the EU's anti-grassroots health commercialisation guidelines aimed at fully flattening the rights of women, the working-class family as a whole, but also at criminalising support for socialist conquests, which laid the foundations for achieving gender parity in social life.

The right to abortion should not be a political struggle, it is a right. But the Polish government has made it an ideological battleground.

Minorities have been under attack, the rule of law has been under attack and women – indeed women's bodies – have been under attack. The right to abortion has been slowly but surely stolen from Polish women. The Polish government's ideology removes rights from people. Creating LGBTI-free zones, it's an ideology, the removal of a woman's rights over her own body, it's an ideology. But regardless of the Polish government's ideology, remember that a ban on abortion does not make abortions disappear, it just puts them underground. Those who can travel abroad do so, those who cannot, are left to crochet needles and kitchen tables. Secret, unsafe, dangerous abortions.

The ruling of the so-called Constitutional Court, whose impartiality and legality of action raise objections, has provoked widespread agitation and spontaneous protests across the country. The Court's decision of 22 October leads to a near-total ban on abortion, which can be regarded as an attack on the fundamental rights of all Citizens of the Union. It also puts Poland on the inglorious podium of countries with the strictest anti-abortion laws in the Community and, more importantly, is contrary to the popular opinion of Polish society.  This attack on the freedoms of Polish women is doubly outrageous when we realise that it was carried out on a political order, in the midst of a pandemic with which the Polish government is completely uneasy. By provoking social dissent, the power-dependent Court has put citizens at risk by giving them a deadly choice between freedom and health.  In Polish tradition, the defence of women is considered a noble attitude. When the Polish authorities raise their hand on The Poles, it is our duty to defend their dignity. That is why I appeal, first of all, to the European Commission – we can help, for example, a mechanism of financial support for women who decide on their own body and will be forced to carry out the procedure outside Poland.

Since the founding of the European Union, its Member States have intensified their efforts to build societies based on shared values of human rights, equality and non—discrimination. In response to increasing societal pressure to ensure equal rights for all, we have made some progress over the years in fighting discrimination and in advancing equality and inclusion of LGBTIQ people in Europe. However, we still have a long way to go. Today in the EU, too many LGBTIQ people cannot be themselves without fear of discrimination, exclusion or violence. In 2019, 43% of LGBTIQ people felt discriminated against. In 2012 this figure was lower, at 37%. All of this takes place in a climate of growing opposition against the protection of LGBTIQ rights and the global pandemic, which has compounded existing inequalities for LGBTIQ people. So the European Commission is taking a strong stand for European diversity by launching the first ever LGBTIQ equality strategy as part of the union of equalities strategic approach. The LGBTIQ equality strategy will help to build a Union where people, in all their diversity, are equal, where they can be themselves without risk of discrimination, exclusion or violence. To achieve this vision, the LGBTIQ strategy presents the Commission’s key actions and objectives for the coming five years around four pillars: tackling discrimination, ensuring safety, building inclusive societies and leading the call for LGBTIQ equality around the world. Several Member States do not have laws to punish hate crime and hate speech against LGBTIQ people. The Commission’s new strategy announces the initiative to extend the list of EU crimes to cover hate crime and hate speech, including when targeted at LGBTIQ people. Due to legal differences across Member States, rainbow families continue to struggle to have their family ties recognised when they cross the EU’s internal borders. Despite the differences in national legislation, the Commission will push for mutual recognition of family relations in the EU. As the President said in her State of the Union speech, when you are a parent, you are a parent everywhere. And in order to improve legal certainty for EU citizens exercising their free movement rights, the Commission will review the 2009 guidelines on free movement. The reviewed guidelines will reflect the diversity of families and hence contribute to facilitating the exercise of free movement rights for all families, including, of course, rainbow families. To realise the strategy’s objectives, the Commission will harness all tools that are at its disposal. Targeted actions will be combined with enhanced equality mainstreaming. LGBTIQ people, like all other groups, are not a homogeneous group, which is why intersectionality will be used as a cross-cutting principle throughout the implementation of the strategy. Furthermore, EU actions to advance LGBTIQ equality need to be matched by sustained efforts at all levels, which is why we are calling for LGBTIQ equality strategy in all the 27 EU Member States. So I really look forward to your debate and your impressions on this strategy.

As an MEP, I consistently advocate for the protection and promotion of good mental health and make sure that my work within Parliament reflects this.  The numerous references throughout this strategy to the importance of ensuring that our LGBTI+ community have their mental health protected is deeply important to me. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to appeal to colleagues in the House, and all EU institutions, to support an EU—wide ban on conversion therapy, a clearly destructive and disgusting practice which has horrifying, detrimental impacts on those who go through it. It has no place in Europe. It violates the fundamental rights of our citizens. It destroys a sense of self and it must go.  My second focus is on the importance of inclusion of LGBTI families in the strategy. For me as a gay woman, being a European, I welcome the rainbow families. They already exist in Europe, they have done so for generations, and we simply have failed to accommodate and advocate for them. This sets that right.  Picking up from what our President, the Commission, and indeed Commissioner Dalli has said herself, a parent in one country is a parent in every country. We cannot pick and choose which families we protect. I am hopeful and I expect us to work together.

This long-awaited strategy is welcomed by LGBTIQ civil society organisations, but also by millions of LGBTI people living in Europe, their parents, their children, and their families and friends. As the Co-Chair of the European Parliament LGBTIQ intergroup, I would like to thank you for the close cooperation we have had with you and also for your close cooperation with civil society. This strategy comes at a very opportune moment because in several Member States of the European Union, for instance Poland and Hungary, the governments have organised a real witch-hunt against LGBTI people. This has even intensified during the pandemic because they want to divert attention from the failures in fighting the virus. We Socialists and Democrats appreciate that this strategy also tackles discrimination in employment by bringing forward legislation to enhance the role of equality bodies. We also welcome the fact that EU funds will strengthen LGBTIQ civil society and research on gender in the Member States.  Hate speech and hate crime is on the rise in the European Union and therefore extending the list of hate crimes, including when LGBTIQ people are targeted, is crucial. Enhancing legal protection for rainbow families and facilitating the exercise of free movement for all families is paramount. We welcome the strong commitment of the Commission that when one is a parent in one country, one is a parent in every country. However, it is regrettable that the commitment on mutual recognition of same-gender partnerships between Member States is softer. By urging Member States to adopt national LGBTIQ action plans, the rights of trans, non-binary and intersex persons can no longer be ignored by Member States. Yes, they exist. They live with us. They live next to us. This strategy, together with the EU Gender Equality Strategy and the intersectional approach, is the best answer to counter the anti-gender movement – a movement made up of ultra-hard-core conservative politicians and their followers by religious fundamentalists, who stand for an outdated patriarchal society where women’s rights and LGBTI rights have no place.  Let me finish by recalling that being an LGBTI person is not an ideology, it is not an identity, and it is not a choice – but being homo, bi, trans and inter-phobic is a choice.

What the Polish government is doing is not representative for the majority of people. That’s why it’s very good that this is on the table, because it’s a political statement. It is representative for the set of values that we represent, the kind of society that we represent: a society where everybody has a place, every European is welcome and safe. What’s in it on hate speech and hate crimes, legislative proposals on rainbow families, is very good, but I would like to echo what has been said by Maria Walsh on conversion therapies, where we want a legal ban at European level. Please, Commissioner, also think about LGBTI sex workers, people who are very marginalised, very vulnerable; think of transgender persons, who still in five countries undergo unnecessary sterilisation, and people who, thanks to Covid measures, are back in an unsafe situation. Finally, Commissioner, I hope that this Commission is not just going to put forward new proposals but will also enforce the existing instruments, because we already have a lot of tools that we could use a lot better.

The European Union, according to all the reports of the European Institute for Gender Equality, Eurobarometer and the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights, is one of the most LGBT friendly areas in the world and it is absurd that ad personam measures should be taken to protect certain categories instead of others, creating discrimination on the contrary. Instead, we want a Parliament that protects all citizens, without distinction of sex, opinion, weight, health, age, personal, political or religious convictions, even when they say that the family is only the natural one, that every child has the right to a mother and a father, that surrogacy is an inhumane practice and that in school our children should not be subjected to gender lessons. Finally, when the President of the Commission talks about the recognition of parenthood for homosexual couples, I would like to remind her of Article 81 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, according to which family law is the exclusive competence of the Member States, and even when there were transnational implications, it would be the Council that should intervene and not the Commission.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 180, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Terry REINTKE", "mepid": "103381", "text": "  on behalf of the Verts/ALE Group. – Madam President, let’s be honest, Europe’s LGBTI community has been attacked on many occasions in recent years but, importantly, this strategy is now a comprehensive plan to create a Union of equality for all of us.

For the first time, the Commission has put a comprehensive equality strategy for LGBT+ people on the table. There is no doubt that these aspirations stem directly from EU values - everyone must be equal, enjoy the right to live in harmony with themselves and must not be discriminated against on grounds of sex, sexual orientation, religion, origin or disability. It should therefore come as no surprise that Parliament is reacting at a time when LGBT+-free zones are being created in some Member States and non-heterosexual teenagers are taking their own lives because of an atmosphere of intolerance in the statements of politicians or state media, which directly translates into public sentiment. The objectives of the strategy are to fight discrimination, ensure the safety and building of a society that includes LGBT+ people, and promote lgbt+ equality efforts around the world. We have a lot of work to do in this regard, in Poland, for example, there is no category of hate crime based on sexual orientation, and education does not provide for the promotion of non-discrimination. ILGA research shows that 70% of LGBT+ teens suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts.

We must do everything we can to ensure that no European is afraid and discriminated against in his daily life, not in the workplace, on the streets, let alone online. I would like to thank the Commission's new LGBTIQ strategy, in fact it is high time that we ensure that all people are not discriminated against. The addition of all forms of hate speech and all hate crimes, including rainbows, to the eu-confirmed list of crimes is a good thing, hate crimes and hate speech are constantly on the increase and we must put a stop to this. We need to ensure that LBGTIQ+ people receive good, reliable, knowledgeable and confidential healthcare in every Member State.

Social policy issues, including measures to combat inequalities, social exclusion and discrimination, fall within the competences shared between the European Union and the Member States (Article 4 and 7 TFEU) and therefore, in the actions taken in this area, the Union is committed to the principle of subsidiarity. The issues of morality, sexual morality, family shape, the relationship between parents and children, the extent of public interference in citizens' intimate lives are deeply rooted in the culture of the EU Member States and are fundamentally diverse. This strategy explicitly seeks to uniformise member states' cultures in terms of understanding basic terms such as gender or social institutions, such as family. In that regard, it infringes Article 167 TFEU. There is no possibility, in accordance with the Treaties, of arbitrary interference by the Commission or Parliament in the content of teaching, including the use of the term 'family' in the context of same-sex relationships. In accordance with Article 167(1) TFEU, the Union has a duty to respect the diversity of member states' cultures, while emphasising their common cultural heritage with Judeo-Christian roots. In accordance with Article 167(4) TFEU, in all its activities under other provisions of the Treaties, the European Union has a duty to promote the diversity of cultures represented there.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 206, "date": "2020-11-25.json", "name": "Nicola BEER", "mepid": "197437", "text": "  We now come to the second round of voting today.
