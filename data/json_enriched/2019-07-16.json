C’est grâce à elle et à toutes les autres icônes européennes que je vous présente aujourd’hui ma vision de l’Europe.  Et 40 ans plus tard, c’est avec une grande fierté que je peux dire: «C’est finalement une femme qui est candidate à la présidence de la Commission européenne.» (Applaudissements) Je le suis grâce à tous ceux et toutes celles qui ont brisé les barrières et les conventions. Je le suis grâce à tous ceux et toutes celles qui ont construit une Europe de paix, une Europe unie, une Europe des valeurs. C’est cette conviction européenne qui m’a guidée tout au long de ma vie et de ma carrière, en tant que mère, en tant que médecin et en tant que femme politique.  C’est ce courage et cette audace des pionnières, comme Simone Veil, qui sont au cœur de ma vision de l’Europe. Et ce sera cet esprit qui guidera la Commission européenne que j’ai l’intention de présider. Herr Präsident, meine Damen und Herren Abgeordnete! Die Gründungsmütter und Gründungsväter Europas haben – aus den Trümmern und der Asche der Weltkriege – ein gewaltiges Werk errichtet: Frieden. Ein starker gemeinsamer Markt, grenzenloser Handel, Reisen, Forschen, Arbeiten. 500 Millionen Europäerinnen und Europäer leben heute zwischen Riga und Limassol, zwischen Athen und Lissabon in Wohlstand und Freiheit. Die Generation meiner Kinder kann sich ein Leben ohne dieses Heimatgefühl Europa gar nicht vorstellen. Als diese glückliche Generation geboren wurde, dachten auch wir Älteren, dass es immer so weiterginge. Heute ist auch den Letzten klar, dass wir wieder kämpfen müssen, dass wir aufstehen müssen für unser Europa. Die ganze Welt ist herausgefordert, mit disruptiven Entwicklungen umzugehen, die auch an Europa nicht vorbeigehen. Der demografische Wandel, die Globalisierung der Weltwirtschaft, die rasante Digitalisierung unserer Arbeitswelt und natürlich der Klimawandel. Keine dieser Meta-Entwicklungen ist neu, sie wurden von der Wissenschaft lange vorausgesagt. Das Neue ist, dass wir heute als Bürgerinnen und Bürger Europas – egal, in welchem Land wir wohnen – die Auswirkungen konkret erleben und spüren. Ob es die finnischen Weizenbauern, die durch die Dürre betroffen sind, ob es die tödliche Hitzewelle in Frankreich ist: Wir spüren den Klimawandel ganz konkret. Ob es die Rentnerin in Irland ist, die mit Online-Banking umgehen muss, oder der Arbeiter in Polen, der sich nach 20 Jahren im Job weiterbilden muss, um überhaupt seine Arbeit zu behalten: Wir spüren die Digitalisierung ganz konkret. Ob es Regionen in Europa sind, in denen Schulen, Krankenhäuser, Betriebe schließen müssen: Wir spüren den demografischen Wandel konkret. All of this has left people with a feeling of losing control: of looser ties with our communities. None of these challenges will go away. But there have been different ways to react to these trends. Some are turning towards authoritarian regimes, some are buying their global influence and creating dependencies by investing in ports and roads. And others are turning towards protectionism. None of these options are for us. We want multilateralism, we want fair trade, we defend the rules-based order because we know it is better for all of us. We have to do it the European way. (Applause) But if we are to go down the European path, we must first rediscover our unity. If we are united on the inside, nobody will divide us from the outside. If we close the gaps between us, we can turn tomorrow’s challenges into tomorrow’s opportunities. Our most pressing challenge is keeping our planet healthy. This is the greatest responsibility and opportunity of our times. I want Europe to become the first climate-neutral continent in the world by 2050. (Applause) To make this happen, we must take bold steps together. Our current goal of reducing our emissions by 40% by 2030 is not enough. We must go further. We must strive for more. A two-step approach is needed to reduce CO2 emissions by 2030 by 50%, if not 55%. The European Union will lead international negotiations to increase the level of ambition of other major economies by 2021 because, to achieve real impact, not only do we have to be ambitious at home – we have to do that, yes – but the world also has to move together. To make this happen, I will put forward a Green Deal for Europe in my first 100 days in office. I will put forward the first ever European Climate Law, which will set the 2050 target in law. This increase in ambition will need investment on a major scale. Public money will not be enough. I will propose a Sustainable Europe Investment Plan and turn parts of the European Investment Bank into a Climate Bank. This will unlock EUR 1 trillion of investment over the next decade. (Applause) It means change. All of us and every sector will have to contribute, from aviation to maritime transport to the way each and every one of us travels and lives. Emissions must have a price that changes our behaviour. To complete this work, and to ensure our companies can compete on a level playing field, I will introduce a Carbon Border Tax to avoid carbon leakage. But what is good for our planet must also be good for our people and our regions. Of course, I know about the importance of cohesion funds. But we need more. We need a just transition for all. Not all of our regions have the same starting point – but we all share the same destination. This is why I will propose a Just Transition Fund to support those most affected. This is the European way: we are ambitious; we leave nobody behind; and we offer perspectives. (Applause) If we want to succeed with this ambitious plan we need a strong economy – because what we want to spend we first have to earn. For that, we need to strengthen the backbone of our economies: the small and medium-sized enterprises. They are innovative, they are entrepreneurial, they are flexible and agile, they create jobs, they provide vocational training to our youth. But they can do all this only if they have access to capital everywhere in this huge single market. Let’s get rid of all the barriers. Let’s open the door. Let’s finally complete the Capital Markets Union. Our small and medium-sized enterprises deserve it. (Applause) And we need to work within the Stability and Growth Pact. Where investment and reforms are needed, we should make sure they can be done. We should make use of all the flexibility allowed in the rules. We are proud of our economy. We want to make it stronger. But there is also a clear and simple logic. It’s not people that serve our economy: it’s the economy that serves our people. (Applause) In our social market economy we must reconcile the market with the social. Therefore, I will refocus our European Semester to make sure we stay on track with our Sustainable Development Goals. And I will stand for fair taxes – whether for brick-and-mortar industries or for digital business. When the tech giants are making huge profits in Europe, this is fine because we are an open market and we like competition. But if they are making these profits by benefiting from our education system, our skilled workers, our infrastructure and our social security, if this is so, it is not acceptable that they make profits but barely pay any taxes because they are playing our tax system. If they want to benefit they have to share the burden. (Applause) Honourable Members, the European way is also about using all of our potential: our people, our talent, our diversity. It is about creating a fairer and more equal Union. This will drive me forward every single day I am in office – as it has throughout my career. We have come a long way since I was a minister for family affairs and had to fight to introduce parental pay or access to childcare for families. But the fight for fairness never stops. It is still too difficult for hard-working families to make ends meet in Europe. I want to ensure that work pays. In a social market economy, every person who is working full time should earn a minimum wage that pays for a decent living. (Applause) Therefore we will develop a framework, of course respecting the different labour markets, but I think the optimal option is to have collective bargaining by employers’ unions and trade unions, because they tailor the minimum wage to the sector or to the region as necessary. Of course, I am aware there are different models, but we have to create the framework.  And I want better protection for those who lose their jobs when our economy takes a severe hit. A European Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme will support our economies and our people in times of external shocks. Of course, there are national unemployment insurance systems, but the Reinsurance Scheme for those heavy external shocks is needed in Europe. I also want more equality and fairness for our young people. Youth unemployment is at 14% in Europe, but ranges from 5% to 40% in some countries. We cannot accept this. Young people have aspirations – they want to work, they want to have a future – and it is our job to let them achieve this. That is why I will make sure that the Youth Guarantee, which I started when I was a Minister for Labour Affairs in the Council, is working as well as it can in every Member State. And I will support the European Parliament’s idea of tripling the Erasmus+ budget as part of the next long-term budget. (Applause) We have to care for the most vulnerable: our children. We have to fight poverty. I know, as a mother of seven, that it makes a difference for their entire life if children have access to education, sports, music, healthy food – and a loving environment. We need a Child Guarantee to help ensure that every child in Europe at risk of poverty and social exclusion has access to the most basic of rights, like healthcare and education. It will empower them and it pays tremendously if we back them when they are young. This is part of my action plan to bring our Pillar of Social Rights to life. And I will start at home by example: I will ensure full gender equality in my College of Commissioners. (Applause) If Member States do not propose enough female Commissioners, I will not hesitate to ask for new names. Since 1958 there have been 183 Commissioners. Only 35 were women. That is less – less – than 20%. We represent half of our population. We want our fair share. (Applause) We also need to talk openly about violence against women. If one in five women have already suffered physical or sexual violence in the European Union, and 55% of women have been sexually harassed, this is clearly not a women’s issue. I will propose to add violence against women to the list of EU crimes defined in the Treaty, and the European Union should join the Istanbul Convention. I am convinced: if we close the gaps between us, we will emerge stronger as a Union. (Applause) The cradle of our European civilisation is Greek philosophy and Roman law. And our European continent went through its darkest period when we were ruled by dictators and the rule of law was banished. For centuries, Europeans fought so hard for their liberty and independence. The rule of law is our best tool to defend these freedoms and to protect the most vulnerable in our Union. That is why there can be no compromise when it comes to respecting the rule of law. There never will be. (Applause) I will ensure that we use our full and comprehensive toolbox at European level. In addition, I fully support an EU-wide Rule of Law Mechanism. And to be clear: the new instrument is not an alternative to the existing instruments, but an additional one. The Commission will always be an independent guardian of the Treaties. Lady Justice is blind – she will defend the rule of law wherever it is attacked.  Honourable Members, the rule of law is universal. It applies to all. In the last five years, more than 17 000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean, which has become one of the deadliest borders in the world. At sea, there is the duty to save lives … (Loud applause) … and in our treaties and conventions there is the legal and moral duty to respect the dignity of every human being. The European Union can and must defend these values. The European Union needs humane borders. We must save, but saving alone is not enough. We must reduce irregular migration and we must fight smugglers and traffickers: it is organised crime. We must preserve the right to asylum and improve the situation of refugees: for example, through humanitarian corridors in close cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. We need both empathy and decisive action. I am aware of how difficult and divisive discussions on these issue are. We need to address the legitimate concerns of many, and to look at how we can overcome our differences. I will propose a New Pact on Migration and Asylum, including the relaunch of the Dublin reform. This will allow us to return to a fully functioning Schengen Area of free movement, the key driver of our prosperity, security and freedoms. A centrepiece in this ambition is a reinforced European Border and Coast Guard Agency. We need to reach a standing corps of 10 000 Frontex border guards not by 2027, but way earlier, at least by 2024. We have to modernise our asylum system. A Common European Asylum System must be exactly that – common. We can have stable external borders only if we give enough help to Member States facing the most pressure because of where they are on the map. We need solidarity. We need to help each other and to contribute. We need a new way of burden sharing. And we must make a fair cooperation offer to countries of origin and transit, in the interest of both sides. Diplomacy, economic development, investment, stability and security are needed so that people have a perspective. I would like to tell you a story about perspective. Four years ago, I was lucky enough to welcome a 19-year-old refugee from Syria into my home and my family. He spoke no German, he was deeply scarred by his experience of civil war and flight. Today, four years later, he is fluent in German, he is fluent in English and, of course, he is fluent in Arabic. He is a community leader by day, in vocational training, and a student for his high school degree by night. He is an inspiration to us all. And one day, he wants to go home. Honourable Members, as a defence minister, I have been many times in this war-torn neighbourhood. I will never forget the words of former President of Iraq Fuad Masum, who said: ‘We want to see more Europe here.’ The world is calling for more Europe. The world needs more Europe. I believe Europe should have a stronger and more united voice in the world – and it needs to act fast. That is why we must have the courage to take foreign policy decisions by qualified majority, and to stand united behind them. (Loud applause. Mixed reactions) The cornerstone of our collective defence will always be NATO. We will stay transatlantic, and we have to become more European. That is why we created the European Defence Union. Our work for our European Union of security and defence is embedded in comprehensive security. Stabilisation always comes with diplomacy, reconciliation and reconstruction. Our servicemen and servicewomen work side by side with police officers, diplomats and development aid workers. These men and women deserve our utmost respect and recognition for their tireless service for Europe. (Applause) I cannot talk about Europe without talking about our friends from the United Kingdom. In 2016, for the very first time, a Member State decided to leave the European Union. (Applause from a section of the House) This is a serious decision. We regret it, but we respect it. Since then, together with the current Government of the United Kingdom, the European Union has worked hard to organise the orderly departure of the United Kingdom. The Withdrawal Agreement concluded with the Government of the United Kingdom provides certainty where Brexit created uncertainty: in preserving the rights of citizens and in preserving peace and stability on the island of Ireland. These two priorities are mine, too. However, I stand ready for a further extension of the withdrawal date, should more time be required for a good reason. (Applause. Objections) In any case, the United Kingdom will remain our ally, our partner and our friend. (Applause) Honourable Members, when I came to Strasburg 13 days ago, I promised I’d come to listen. I have heard your concerns, your hopes and your expectations. The political guidelines, which I sent to you today, reflect our discussions. From what I have heard, I have drawn my conclusions and I have made my decisions. First, I want European citizens to play a leading and active part in building the future of our Union. I want them to have their say at a Conference on the Future of Europe, to start in 2020 and to run for two years.  Second, I want us to work together to improve the Spitzenkandidaten system. We need to make it more visible to a wider electorate and we need to address the issue of transnational lists at the European elections as a complementary tool of European democracy. (Applause) And third – yes – I support a right of initiative for the European Parliament.  (Loud applause) When this House, acting by majority of its Members, adopts resolutions requesting the Commission to submit legislative proposals, I commit to responding with a legislative act in full observance of the proportionality, subsidiarity and better-law-making principles. I am convinced that our stronger partnership will further help to make people’s voices heard. Herr Präsident, mein Vater war 15 Jahre alt, als der schaurige Krieg, durch den mein Land Tod, Verwüstung, Vertreibung und Zerstörung über unseren Kontinent gebracht hat, endete. Er hat seinen Kindern, mir und meinen sechs Geschwistern, oft davon erzählt. Er hat vor allem davon erzählt, was es für ihn bedeutet hat, dass die anderen Länder uns wieder die Hand gereicht haben und uns zurückgenommen haben in den Kreis der demokratischen Völker. Er hat bei der Montan-Union angefangen und hat uns anfangs gesagt: „Wir treiben wieder Handel und wenn man Handel treibt, dann schließt man Freundschaften, und Freunde schießen nicht aufeinander.“ Er war Kabinettschef bei von der Groeben in der Hallstein-Kommission und später Generaldirektor für Wettbewerbsfragen. Deshalb bin ich hier in Brüssel geboren und Europäerin gewesen, bevor ich später gelernt habe, dass ich Deutsche bin und Niedersächsin bin. Und deshalb gibt es für mich nur eines: Europa einen und stärken. Wer mit mir dieses Europa stärken, wachsen und blühen lassen will, hat mich als leidenschaftliche Kämpferin an seiner oder ihrer Seite. Wer aber dieses Europa schwächen, spalten und ihm seine Werte nehmen will, der findet in mir eine erbitterte Gegnerin. (Beifall) Als mein Vater alt und an seinem Lebensende war, da hatte sich seine Erzählung von Europa verändert. Er sprach nicht mehr so viel vom Krieg. Er sagte: „Europa ist wie eine lange Ehe. Die Liebe wird vielleicht nicht größer als am ersten Tag, aber sie wird tiefer“. Weil wir wissen, dass wir uns aufeinander verlassen können, in guten wie in schweren Zeiten. Weil wir wissen, dass wir streiten können, aber uns auch wieder versöhnen können. Weil wir nie vergessen, warum wir diesen Bund eingegangen sind. Und wir hier alle in diesem Raum leben in einem Europa, das gewachsen ist, das gereift ist, das stark geworden ist mit seinen 500 Millionen Menschen. Über 200 Millionen Menschen sind zur Wahl gegangen. Dieses Europa hat Einfluss. Dieses Europa will Verantwortung übernehmen für sich und diese Welt.  Das ist nicht immer leicht, das weiß ich, das ist schmerzhaft und anstrengend, aber es ist unsere nobelste Pflicht! Die Menschen wollen sehen, dass wir liefern, dass wir vorankommen. Die Jugend fordert das. Meine Kinder sagen mir zurecht: „Spielt nicht auf Zeit, macht was draus“. Und dazu bin ich angetreten. Dazu brauche ich Ihre Hilfe und Unterstützung. Dazu rufe ich alle Europäerinnen und Europäer auf, mitzumachen.

Following the election of our President two weeks ago, the election of the President of the European Commission is now on the agenda. I would like to thank Ursula von der Leyen for her programme, for her ideas, for her proposals for the future of Europe. For us as the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, our election promises are at the heart of the agenda. The promises we have made to the people are a point of reference for us. 40 million people have been elected by the 183 Members of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. We are committed to these 40 million people, and they expect us to implement the issues we have promised them: a just Europe with comparable living conditions for all, a modern Europe where we remain or must become the research department of the world, a secure Europe that secures borders against illegal migration and at the same time helps people in need, a europe open to the world, a europe open to the world. , trade and partnership with Africa, and an ecological Europe that protects our environment, our climate while keeping an eye on social and economic consequences. Ursula von der Leyen is a Christian Democrat, she is a convinced European, and that is why we will work with her to implement our election promises. The European People's Party will support and vote for Ursula von der Leyen today. I would like to thank Frans Timmermans, Ska Keller, Bas Eickhout and others for their dedicated campaigning at European level. I enjoyed the contest of being a candidate, showing face, accepting the contest, fighting for his convictions objectively, convincing people and then respecting the election result as a Democrat. 201 million people took part in the European elections – what a celebration of democracy! And their desire is to have a democratic Europe.  Developments in recent days have not always taken up this strong sign of people. If, for example, we designate democratic nominees as unelectable out of party political egoisms, thereisabout damage to democracy. Damage has been done, yes, but you cannot heal damage done by dealing new damage. Europe now needs capacity for action and stability. That is why, two weeks ago, my group supported the Socialist candidate David Sassoli as President of the European Parliament, and I expect today, as group chairman of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, to support Ursula von der Leyen as President of the Commission. I say today that we must be able to rely on each other, and that is the only way that Europe can succeed. (Applause) Of course, over the next five years, we must be committed to a democratic Europe: a right of legislative initiative – thank you for the commitment – strengthened investigative rights, better control of the implementation of European law and the legal anchoring of the leading candidate concept, so that the backrooms are finally a thing of the past. I and my group will be in favour of a Europe that belongs to the people. For us Christian Democrats, today is a day of departure. We now want to tackle and shape, with Ursula von der Leyen as the new President of the Commission.

The future of the Union is in our hands. And my political group, which has been in its DNA since the beginning and has Europeanism in its DNA, wants to continue to build this Europe of ours. We have a responsibility to the citizens who have given us their trust and that is why we want to act with responsibility. We want to make sure that, over the next five years, we will lay the foundations for a project and a sustainable future for all Europeans and Europeans. Let me, on a day like today, remind a great Europeanist who, just forty years ago, took the floor in this Parliament: Willy Brandt. In that plenary session, held just after the first direct elections in 1979, he appealed that is now worth remembering. He lamented how slowly European democracy was advancing and that it had taken too long to implement the direct suffrage elections. He also lamented that the European institutions still seemed far removed from citizenship. That is why he called on MEPs to be able to get to work, beyond ideological and geographical differences, to solve people's problems and, above all, to connect with young people. Forty years later, this speech is more alive than ever. It still seems to the Socialists that European democracy is moving too slowly. We have put a lot of enthusiasm into the Spitzenkandidat project and we have also been beaten by transnational lists. But on this occasion we haven't made it. However, we do not give up. European democracy has no turning back. That is why we welcome your commitment, Mrs von der Leyen, to resume and refine the Spitzenkandidat process by 2024. We also want Europe to solve people's problems, who are able to meet today's challenges. And we need to know that before we give it our support to chair the Commission. We need to know if he will be able to lead the change that citizens are asking of us and the transformation that young Europeans are asking of us. You have sent us a letter pointing in the right direction, which proposes progress, but now you have the possibility to make even more concrete. You assume the objective of combating climate urgency and translating that ambition into legislation. This law is necessary, as well as setting binding targets to meet our emission reduction commitments by 2030. But, in addition to ecological transformation, it is essential for us that no one is left behind and, therefore, we are pleased to see that you accept the substance for a just transition. It also reflects the need to implement an investment plan for a sustainable Europe. It is important to make it clear that a significant part of that effort must come from public investment. When we ask to introduce the sustainable development goals in the European Semester, we do not just want them to be considered as a principle. We also want measurement criteria and indicators to be introduced. We do not want governments that invest in an economic transformation that cares for people, creates new opportunities and lays the foundations for a sustainable future with excessive deficits. That is why we insist — and you have also included this in your letter — on the flexibility of economic rules and on the incorporation of unemployment insurance. Europe has to protect the most vulnerable. That is why we will always support from our political group the European social pillar and, in particular, the Children's Guarantee and the Youth Guarantee. Mrs von der Leyen, we need stronger action against poverty in general. To finance all these policies, everyone must do their part, including large technology corporations. You want them to contribute their taxes to the common effort, but have you thought of a figure? It also mentions that the situation of workers on the new platforms should be protected and improved. Here you will have a political group that will support a directive in that regard. I am pleased to see that, on issues of gender equality, we are on the same page. Because you know that, for my political group, it's a clear priority. Adopting a binding equality strategy and including gender-based violence as one of the offences covered by the Treaties of the Union is undoubtedly a good start. He says he will defend the rule of law and proposes a new mechanism to ensure compliance. Can you explain to us what this mechanism would consist of? I believe that many and many in this room would be reassured to see that, indeed, you intend to maintain the demand shown by the current Commission and, in particular, Commissioner Frans Timmermans on rule of law. With regard to migration management, we appreciate your proposal to act more in solidarity between member states and to end Dublin's reform. We need to talk about solidarity. We need to talk about humanitarian corridors. It's not just about strengthening security and increasing Frontex's troops. It is also about saving people's lives and, for that, we need a rescue system that does not criminalize NGOs and a humanitarian visa system. Only then will we live up to the circumstances. Mrs. von der Leyen, we're here to listen to you. We do not want an institutional crisis that further delayed the changes Europe needs.

You know very well, the Council that appointed you is a divided Council. Finally agreed on a comprehensive package of appointments to achieve a compromise after long and difficult negotiations. Moreover, I regret that the balance between the east and west of the European Union is not reflected in this package, and I hope, however, that it will be partially restored with the allocation of important portfolios in the future college. Today, here, there is no package. There is only one nomination – yours – based on the commitments you have made before us. Today, we are looking for a majority that will enable Europe to move forward and meet the very clear expectations expressed during the elections.  The idea of Spitzenkandidat – to elect the President of the European Commission by the vote of all European citizens – has not been carried out. This Parliament will have to do so by the end of this mandate, and I am glad that you are taking on the idea of a conference for the future of Europe, which will complete this process of democratisation. Europeans need to know that in these last days, the negotiation carried out with you by pro-European political groups has been based on a common political platform of these groups. If elected, this platform should provide us with a common and transparent framework between Parliament and the European Commission, with clearly assumed objectives for the next 5 years.  Our group is ready to support you, insofar as you assume independence and the force of proposal for the renewal of Europe. The clearer the commitments you are making today and are shared by a strong pro-European majority, the more we will be able to build a Europe for European citizens that restores confidence and hope. Before the elections, a great anti-European wave was announced, which would have overwhelmed this Parliament and put Europe in great difficulty. Well, this tsunami has not occurred, and pro-European forces are strong in this new Parliament. But we must no longer disappoint the millions of Europeans who have said 'yes' to this Europe. They expect it to defend the rule of law without hesitation. We cannot disappoint the millions of young people who have come to vote and called for the fight against climate change, for decent jobs for their generation. We must not disappoint millions of entrepreneurs, employees and farmers, who expect Europe to become a real opportunity in an open world, a Europe that builds an economy for people, able to integrate ecology, climate balance, sustainability, but also new technologies and digital strategy, as opportunities and not constraints. The internal market must be taken out of the logic of numbers and bureaucracy and generate wealth for people.  But above all, we expect from you, Mrs Ursula von der Leyen, a real European and pro-European leadership. Europe is not just an administration, but it is primarily a political ambition, an ambition of citizens. If you are confirmed by this Parliament, which I want you, you will often hear explanations and arguments around you that convince you that many changes are not possible, and yet you will have to make them possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 5, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr President, our common house is burning. It is burning with a dying climate, collapsing biodiversity and depleted natural resources. It burns with ever deeper inequalities, fuelled by neoliberal globalization and technological revolutions. It burns with a sudden, or sometimes more devious, retreat from fundamental freedoms and the rule of law.  In the face of this triple emergency, goodwill and general intentions are not enough. We need a fierce determination to change course, even if it means offending head-on the interests of those who defend the status quo. This is our determination and it is on such a mandate for change that the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance was elected in May.  So here you are today in front of us, Mrs von der Leyen. Just three weeks ago, you had no idea that you would run for the highest office in the European Union. That's not to say that learning must have been fast.  Your performances last week did not convince us of your sense of urgency, nor of your determination to reorient the Union's policies. By comparison, the speech you have just given and the accompanying writings are a clear step forward. I welcome your plea, supported by concrete measures, for equality between women and men.  I also note that you are personally in favour of halving our CO2 emissions by 2030, that you are taking up the idea of a carbon tax at the borders or that of European unemployment reinsurance, all of which are taboo ideas in the political family from which you come; I salute your courage in this regard. But if your speech is more concrete today, it falls well short of our expectations. Let me explain why based on a few examples. Why, for example, raise our climate targets in two stages in the face of urgency, and not immediately? In fact, when you read the detail of what you write to two political groups, you feel this idea of conditionality. In other words, we will move forward when others are ready to move forward as well. You rightly point out that the ecological transition should not leave anyone at the side of the road. However, you cannot ignore that if the price of carbon rises, everyone - and, in particular, the most insecure - will be affected.  The answer to this is not, as you suggest, a European Adjustment Fund, but rather a profound revision of our taxation so that it finally becomes fair again. The environment is not just about the climate. Not a word from you about biodiversity or the depletion of resources such as arable land or fresh water. In these areas, the Common Agricultural Policy, the EU's first budget, has a disastrous impact. A Copernican revolution is therefore necessary, but it remains taboo for you. Would the great ambitions be shattered by the well-understood interests of some? Let's move on to free trade treaties. In their present form, they are cardinal instruments of a globalization that, at the same time, exhausts the planet and exacerbates inequalities. You are in favour of these treaties including, as they already do, sustainable development clauses, but you cautiously refrain from committing to these clauses being binding and punishable. Nor is there a word about the preferential treatment that continues to be reserved for so-called investors.  On the issue of asylum and migration, I have not really heard you question the 'fortress Europe' scandal. It is shameful and undignified that the Union relies on authoritarian regimes or failed states to ensure the sealing of its borders at all costs. And this at the cost of massive human rights violations, sometimes committed by armed gangs such as these famous Libyan coastguards, financed with European money. You are proposing a new pact on asylum and migration. Mrs von der Leyen, this pact exists. It was adopted by a majority of five political groups by this Parliament. Don't reinvent the wheel! Take it over and go fight the Council!  Finally, on the rule of law, your language is all the stronger because your proposals remain relatively vague. Is it a question of changing the situation and ensuring that European values are respected everywhere and at all times, or, on the contrary, of sparing those Heads of State and Government who, within the Union itself, as in Hungary and Poland, regularly flout fundamental freedoms and the separation of powers?  In short, where a change of course is required to the extent of the triple social, environmental and democratic emergency, you propose here a inflection, there incremental changes and, above all, a lot of blur.  You will understand that, under these conditions, the environmentalists are not ready today to entrust you with the helm of the Union.  Dear Mrs von der Leyen, I would like to point out that since the elections, the Greens/European Free Alliance group has spared no effort to form a majority here that is both pro-European and pro-change. Such a venture takes time to bear fruit. Your insistence on a vote today deprives us of that time.  While we welcome your courtesy to us, we have not felt any real preference for such an alliance on your part. On the contrary, we feel ready to welcome any support from wherever it comes, including populist national ranks. We cannot do that. But, as I told you a week ago, the sale starts when the customer says no.  If you were to be elected tonight, rest assured that we will be prepared to be persuaded and to assist whenever your proposals are up to the social, environmental and democratic emergency, in other words, to meet the existential challenges we face.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 6, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Jörg MEUTHEN", "mepid": "190518", "text": "  On behalf of the ID Group, I would like to make a i-see of the Mr President, Minister von der Leyen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the Commissioner for her work and for her work. We have a very important and exposed personnel decision to make today in this House. The office of President of the European Commission is of great importance to the Union and its Member States. That is why this decision is to be taken with great care. Only one person of the highest suitability can be eligible for this position. Minister von der Leyen, with all due respect to you, we in the Identity and Democracy Group, after careful consideration, believe that you are not up to the demands of this office. I would like to explain this briefly: firstly, we Germans have our own experience with your way of running and shaping policy. Over the years, we have seen you in Germany as Minister for Family Affairs, as Minister for Labour and Social Affairs, and finally as Minister for Defence. In none of these offices have you satisfactorily fulfilled your task of serving the good of the German people. I am saving you and the auditorium here an explicit list of your failure. They have destroyed our squad. Today it is as miserable as it has never been equipped and practically incapable of defence. There will be a great breath of fresh air in the Bundeswehr when you resign as Minister of Defence tomorrow, regardless of the outcome of today. A complete reboot in virtually all areas will be needed here.  Now, German governments in the past have often placed politicians who have become unpopular in Brussels posts. But that can no longer be the claim here and now. From our point of view, there is nothing to suggest that you would fill the position of the Commission Presidency better than your previous posts. Your presentation tour through the House and its political groups, your long list of cloudy promises of this and that, and usually also of its opposite, depending on where they were presented, was by no means only critical of us. You assure the left and liberals that you want to stick strictly to the Article 7 procedure against Poland and Hungary. In the ECR Group, you agree to mild rules of law and tolerance in the distribution of migrants. These contradictions are glaring. And today you serve here an incredible bouquet of well-sounding keywords. There should be something for everyone that they like to hear. Here in your candidacy tour, you show a classic mainstream political behavior, make empty promises, play a kind of Jekyll and Hyde with the factions in the fearful hope that somehow enough votes for your election will be able to generate in the end. Their problem with all this is that they lack any convincing vision of a modern Union of the fatherlands that truly serves the people of the Union, wisely and sensibly limited to its core tasks. On the contrary, they promise even more centralisation, even more taxation, even more paternalism, even more presumption of competence and completely contradictory content. They are still afflicted with the old thinking, but obviously do not feel it. Of the questions I asked you last week in the Conference of Presidents on my group, you did not answer two at all and the third answered very unsatisfactory. You cannot convince us of the ID Group with such a socialist performance, as we have said here today. We shall therefore vote against you.

I will make a speech on the one hand, from what you have said, in more circumstances, in recent days, than the role of Parliament: you rightly called it 'the heart of democracy'. I start from this to say that we have systems here that can make things work, but things only work if everyone respects the system. She spoke of gender equality, she spoke of the great importance and importance of the role of a woman for the first time at the head of the Commission. It does so just a few hours after what happened last night in this Parliament, in which another woman, one of the most voted in Europe ever, former Prime Minister of her country in Poland, was not voted chairman of the EMPL Committee for a partisan, undemocratic, illogical and incomprehensible choice.  And I start from this, because I think it is important when we always remind ourselves of the rules, otherwise we risk appearing hypocritical with regard to the rules, because in no way can we imagine asking for a consensus or giving Parliament a role by not respecting the d'Hondt method or having prejudices of this seriousness.  And why will our position lead to even more careful reflection? Because in the last few hours you have written letters and, as you know, words fly and instead the writings remain. We have therefore read very carefully the letters you have written to the Socialist Group and the Renew Group, and we are asking you to clarify them this morning, just as the other groups have done.  But, if possible, I respect, for example, the things that Mrs García Pérez said, which are contrary to what you asked for. In other words, you have asked for clarification on the subject of the rule of law mechanism. Well, we also ask you to clarify this, in your reply, but from diametrically opposed positions, because if the method is that of the past five years, invented by Timmermans, we are certainly on a totally alternative and contrasting position and therefore we have no clarity with regard to the rule of law mechanism, just as it is important to talk about climate change as well. Because it is clear that on the subject of climate change there are positive points, which have been indicated by you, such as the Just Transition Fund to help communities mitigate the effects of climate policy, a bank for sustainable investments to mobilize private capital, but once again we are discussing targets. We are moving the stakes of our ambitions higher and higher without saying how we can achieve them.  Will we ever set ourselves a goal and really stick to it? It's all a little confusing. You suggest that it should be changed this morning, if I have understood 50 %, last week 55 %, it does not seem to me to be a small difference from the objective to be achieved, and all this seems more like a declaration of intent, given that there are countries which, as you know, and you know very well, have more than a third of coal production. But still the subject of social policy to which reference is made. An important issue such as the one that our group has always had the opportunity to criticise, why is there enthusiastic talk of the European minimum wage guaranteeing all young people a job, with what resources and with what relation to the policy of the individual Member States on all this?  And again on immigration, you gave us this morning a very nice, positive example of a school. She told us that a refugee arrived in Germany, was welcomed by her and then became a very beautiful and interesting story. Well, that is not the case, because in addition to the refugees there are immigrants, there are illegal immigrants and there are situations for which it is good to ask you for a word of clarity, because in this Parliament, in recent days, something has happened from our very serious point of view.  Because a person who is under investigation in our country for ramming a Guardia di Finanza ship, failing to comply with the orders of the national authorities and risking the death of Italian law enforcement officers in this Parliament, was the subject of a debate in the LIBE Committee last week in order to be able to invite her to a hearing. These are simple approaches, for which I would like to ask you for equally clear answers, because with these answers it will facilitate our reflection which will be made at the end of this debate at our group meeting.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE-DE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "PPE-DE"}, {"id": 8, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Martin SCHIRDEWAN", "mepid": "190517", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to like to sanendour sto -- on behalf of the GUE/NGL Group. Mr President, Mrs von der Leyen, I would like to thank mrs von der Leyen for her excellent work and for the work she has done. There has been a lot of talk about European citizens, and I have received hundreds, if not thousands, of e-mails in the last few days, as probably many other Members, who are dealing with your nomination. I would like to take this opportunity to give the floor to the European demos here, by quote from one of these e-mails. It says: 'As a voter, I expect Parliament to elect one of the leading candidates as President of the European Commission'. And the lady, from whose e-mail I am currently citing, then continues: \"In my view, the appointment of a Defence Minister as President of the Commission would be a decision with a fatal signal that the EU is taking a course towards militarisation and isolation.\" I do not think there is anything to add to the criticism of your nomination or to the content. I would like to refer to the meeting we had last week. You were in the Left Group and presented your idea, your vision of the European future, and it has become clear that our vision is different. I would also like to justify this at this point. We are the only group in this House who are united in our opposition to the continuation of austerity. And if someone like you, who, like you, talks about the future of Europe, I believe that he must finally break with this false neoliberal ideology. Austerity has not led, for example, to the rebuilding of state budgets, but, on the contrary, it has only meant that public investment could no longer be made, for example, that there was no longer any investment in education, that no more investment was made in health protection, and also that there were no resources available to fight decisively against climate change. The victims of this policy are the citizens throughout the European Union. Mrs von der Leyen, anyone who wants to combat the climate emergency must act now, and anyone who wants to cope with economic structural change must invest now, and anyone who wants to guarantee social security in the European Union must now break with this false austerity policy. 113 million people – these are official figures from the Commission – live in poverty or are affected by poverty in the European Union, and I expect more than flowery words from a Candidate for the Presidency of the Commission. I expect you to stand here and say: yes, I understand that we need a social offensive for the European Union. My aim is that in five years' time, no European citizen, no matter what age, in which region, will be affected by a need for livelihoods, but will be able to live a dignified life.  This, of course, requires the financial conditions. Unfortunately, however, in the area of tax policy, you have remained very vague today. I tell you that velvet gloves are the wrong tool to ensure tax justice. I expect a candidate for the Presidency of the Commission to have the firm will and courage to engage with the corporations and to say quite clearly here: yes, I want to put an end to tax dumping, I want to close the tax havens in the European Union too, and I want to finally share corporations and assets fairly in the tax revenue and ensure tax justice. (Applause) Billions more are now to be invested in the armament of the European Union. You have made that clear once again. So that is money that will be lacking, for example, for social security, health, education, etc., and that will not go to public services of general interest, but, for example, to modern weapons systems. Some people even dream of a space army these days. I think, to be honest, this is more of a nightmare. But whether you are talking about a European army or an army of Europeans, that is, for me, a word-of-the-word thing. After all, the objective is quite clear: the result is an armament of the European Union and a militarisation of foreign policy. As a left-wing group in the European Parliament, we are firmly opposed to this. We call for an EU strategy to strengthen diplomatic conflict resolution. In our view, a first step would be to convene an international conference on disarmament. I would like to mention one last point. Europe's external borders are currently the deadliest borders in the world. I think it is a political declaration of bankruptcy of European policy that people have to die every day in the Mediterranean, while those who defend universal human rights are being criminalised in some Member States. Mrs von der Leyen, I have listened very carefully to what you said earlier. As a left-wing group, we will pay close attention to the policy you are trying to implement. However, I think that our plan – and this has become clear – for the future of the European Union, a social European Union, a climate-friendly European Union and a peaceful European Union, is not compatible with your vision.

(Applause) And that is the beauty of this Europe: in this Europe, countries are voluntarily together in the European Union because no one has forced them, but because together we know that together we are stronger, that together we can defend values that are important to us and that have brought us together, that the tasks of the world that challenge us are so great that none of us can cope with them alone. , but that, when we work together, we develop a force, a soft power that is uniquely European, based on the values of our European Union, and which makes us strong and also enables us to overcome this future, which we want to tackle with great strength and confidence for our children. I would therefore like to address some of the issues: the social market economy, a European unique selling point, is precisely this beautiful combination of a powerful economy. But we know that we all work together in this powerful economy, and that is why the result of this powerful economy must be returned to the people. This is a social market economy. That is why we are talking about the social pillar, which has been jointly adopted by the Council, the European Parliament and the Commission. In other words, there can be no greater support for the right thing to do, with all the ambition, all the determination to work on. We will never be perfect, but the effort to improve, to actually tackle the individual issues in the social pillar with strength, that must be our primary objective. And when the issue of the SDGs, which are the guiding principle for us, is raised, then the Sustainability Goals are in all our interests. We have all understood by now that the clock is ticking, that time is limited, that our planet needs help, that our creation is the basis of life in which we build our entire life, that it must be viewed in a climate-friendly and sustainable way. And that is why it is in all our interests to be able to implement the Sustainability Goals with all our strength and intensity. As far as the two steps are concerned, they must be carried out in parallel. What I have just said implies that we need to tackle powerful changes at home in the European Union, but we know that we need changes on this globe of great players just as at the same time. And Europe can take the lead here, and Europe must take the lead in advancing this change. There has already been a unique combination of all forces in the Paris climate agreement. Let us fall back on this, let us continue in this spirit with one of the most pressing tasks we have ever had!  The second major pressing task is the issue of digitisation, and here too we need united forces. Here, too, we need, on the one hand, the forces that must be able to tackle this digitalisation with momentum, to advance our economy, to give it the opportunity, but on the other hand, in the spirit of our social market economy with an ethical framework, to be able to tackle the whole issue of \"artificial intelligence\" and risks with great care, care and measure. And we need to be more powerful in cybersecurity than Europeans. We know that there are many risks there that we can only manage together. Whether it is risks that are relevant to our economy or risks that are relevant to our society. And here, too, no state of our secane is capable of dealing with this alone, but we can only build together here the security for our Europe that this Europe deserves. The people in digitalisation – that is the most noble task of our social market economy is that we should now learn the basic principles of protection, namely that if someone works here, he or she also gets protection to the extent that work is done and the way in which we work, in which we must now learn how to transfer them into the digitised world. The topic of clickworkers or cloud workers – how can we implement the basic principles of protection and performance there? These are all tasks that we want to accomplish together, and that is why I have of great interest. I can only say to Mr Meuthen that when I have listened to you, I am almost relieved that I do not get a vote from you. For me, this is the absolute opposite of what I expect.

More ambitious environmental objectives, investment plan for sustainability which – I am precise – requires more public investment, more public investment, full use of flexibility to ensure support for growth, European scheme for the reinsurance of unemployment benefits, minimum wage, European guarantee against child poverty, common consolidated basis for corporate taxation, defence of the rule of law, humanitarian corridors , a new pact for migration and asylum based on solidarity, and then, at institutional level, Parliament's right of initiative, the transition to the Community method in crucial areas, the strengthening of the Spitzenkandidaten system.

It will have to balance two parts and two very divergent interests, those of the right that wants a Europe that controls immigration more strongly, that wants a realistic and pragmatic approach to climate, that supports the economy, growth, industry and work, and that of a left that has an ideological approach, that has an indiscriminate welcoming approach, that has a Taliban approach on the climate issue , and that will be the big problem with your mandate. It is from a centre-right politician to decide whether he wants to give in to the blackmail of the left, as he seemed to want to do in his letters of reply to the Socialists and Liberals, or as it has seemed in many places in your speech today to have a pragmatic approach that will really enable Europe to get out of the mud where this approach has led it, from the crisis, where the wrong policies have led it. , from an endless crisis.

In recent years, the left-wing pro-immigration majority in the European Parliament has wanted to abolish them by all means, including through the procedure under Article 7 of the Treaty, the rights laid down in Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union. We expect the new President of the European Commission, as head of the body that is the guardian of the Treaties, to do everything possible to fully respect national identity and the constitutional sovereignty of the Member States.  Thirdly, regional development and agricultural support and rural development resources are not donations of mercy to the currently less developed Member States, regions and citizens of the Union, but investments in achieving one of the fundamental objectives of the functioning of the Union, economic, social and territorial cohesion as laid down in Article 3 of the Treaty. We expect the new President of the European Commission to ensure that the eu's next seven-year framework budget does not punish but support the V4 countries, central European Member States, which are developing at a faster pace than the EU average and are making serious efforts to reduce poverty.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hu", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 21, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Miriam DALLI", "mepid": "124970", "text": "   – Madam President, the next five years require leadership that does not consider ‘business as usual’ as the point of departure. We need a European Commission that is ambitious, progressive and not resistant to change.  Ms von der Leyen, it is positive that you plan to make the European Union climate neutral by 2050 and that you are committing to putting this into law during your first 100 days. But when it comes to the 2030 target, keep in mind that this Parliament asked for a 2030 target of 55%, because this is what is in line with the long—term strategy and with the Paris goals.  You speak about extending the Emissions Trading System (ETS). Maritime and aviation need to contribute, but the ETS can never be extended to transport in general, as that risks undermining the CO2 standards we have worked hard for. That’s why we ask for a clear commitment that you will not go back from the CO2 standards that we agreed upon.  We need to see much more on the environment. We need you to speak and commit to a biodiversity strategy and we also need to understand your position on the non-toxic environment strategy.  The EU requires also a revamped industrial policy, an Industry 4.0 that does not focus only on digitisation and automation but includes also the ecological aspect; an industrial policy that takes into account our current workers, our future employees, our students and our youth.  Allow me a final word on migration. You speak about a fresh start on migration. As an MEP hailing from one of the frontline Member States, Malta, I urge you to put migration as a priority, where solidarity does not remain a buzzword but where legislative proposals, such as the Dublin regulation, are enacted and become law so that not only a few countries shoulder the responsibility alone, as is happening today. We need policies that are game—changers if the European project is to move forward, and these are the policies that we, as the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, will be pushing for.

I quote your words in your letter to our Group. And the reason is that, while these issues may not be the only important ones – you mentioned climate change, the social pillar and so on – they are issues which could make or break the European Union. We all know this. And for this reason, you are saying the correct words, giving the headlines that we want to hear, but, as you’ve heard from many Members, we need to have the concrete ideas underneath the words. In the Dublin process, on this so-called Pact for Migration, you and I know that it requires qualified majority voting (QMV) from the Member States. The fact of this inertia in the Council – that there has been nothing on migration, while we see people drowning in the Mediterranean – is something that you can do something about. You mentioned QMV on foreign relations issues, but you didn’t mention it here. And the criminalisation of NGOs, and the humanitarian corridors: all these things are the detail that we need to hear.

You said, in quite a dignified way, that should an extension be required for the United Kingdom there would have to be good reasons.

Pragmatic – that is the kind of partnership we want to see, as opposed to the kind of fantasy Brexit that we’re hearing about from other people in this Chamber.

Germany and France, correct me, already had six, many countries in the center had a higher number, while fifteen countries of the periphery, including Croatia, had a straight zero.

It is the destiny of our civilization that is at stake today. There is only one way to reduce anxiety and scepticism, it is to re-found a Europe that puts itself at the service of the peoples of Europe and which allows us to no longer suffer, no longer suffer the imbalances of globalisation, this lack of strategy that has caused us to lose our industrial strengths, our know-how, our ability to produce what we consume. I am thinking in particular of farmers and I regret, in fact, that they were not mentioned more this morning. Agriculture is the first policy of the European Union and we will never accept here in the EPP that it serves as an adjustment variable. We no longer want to suffer the imbalances that cause the ecological crisis and it is to face this challenge that Europe, thank you for saying this morning, must finally impose a carbon contribution on all the countries that export to the European Union. We no longer want to suffer the same powerlessness in the face of the migration crisis. Yes, every death in the Mediterranean Sea is a tragedy. But yes, each of these tragedies is the result of a single cause that is our impotence. Too many people take all the risks to come to Europe, because they know that the only condition to settle there is to get there illegally. It is therefore finally necessary to control Europe's external borders and it is the duty of humanity that commands it. To welcome is not to suffer, it is also the condition to regain the balance of our societies and to pass on to the coming generations this magnificent civilization that we have inherited.

Immediately after the emergence of the New Democracy in the government of our country, the Eurogroup discussed the course of the Greek economy within the framework of the syriza agreements with the government against the background of the fourth evaluation and the medium-term programme 2020-2023. The Commission and the Eurogroup identify a number of budgetary gaps, requiring strict compliance with 3.5% of primary surpluses, commitments under post-monumental enhanced surveillance, i.e. new heavy measures on the backs of the Greek people, at a cost of EUR 4.5 to 6 billion. These decisions form the basis for the new democracy government's policy, provide for a general auction of popular housing, an increase in tax collection measures for non-performing loans, new cuts in pensions, allowances, privatisations, greater commercialisation of health, welfare and education.

If we want to combat unemployment, we must have an economic policy which, however, focuses above all on the real economy. We need a European industrial policy that has a target, as there is for environmental policy, 20% of gross domestic product must come from manufacturing, industry and agriculture.  I would ask you, when you are President of the Commission, to strengthen the GROW Directorate-General, I would ask you to implement the Small Business Act to support small and medium-sized enterprises, and I would ask you to defend our industries against the Chinese assault. It has made some interesting proposals, but we must also have very serious anti-dumping rules. We must defend ourselves against the web giants that have to pay taxes like all other businesses, but we also need to strengthen agricultural policy. Cuts in the CAP are a mistake, and we must not forget that industry and agriculture are two fundamental instruments for creating jobs in our European Union. Then, of course, as you said, access to credit: we need to move forward with the Banking Union, we need to develop a capital market.  As far as immigration is concerned, I would ask you to reflect on what the European Parliament has also voted for, plus money for a real plan for Africa, we need EUR 50-60 billion. In 2050 we will have two and a half billion Africans, if we do not act today, the Frontex guards are not enough, we need a real strategy to invest in Africa, combat climate change, poverty, diseases, defend agriculture and fight terrorism. If Europe does not act, we will have an invasion of millions of people, not thousands. So the next European Commission needs to do a lot.  I will end with the rule of law, you said very fair words, but today it is exactly 21 months since the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia, a journalist murdered in Malta. We still don't know who was in charge of that murder. We must defend the rule of law everywhere. We must defend freedom of expression and also in countries outside the European Union, I am thinking of Venezuela, where there are millions of citizens of European, Italian, Spanish and Portuguese origin, including Germans who continue to suffer as a result of a dictatorship. I believe that, from this point of view too, the European Commission, as Parliament has done, must make its voice heard loud and clear, because we are above all a community of values.

In fact, what we see in cohesion policies is that the proposal that the Commission has put forward is unfair. Just to give an example: a country like Italy, which is on the European average, rises 6 % in cohesion, a country like Croatia drops 6 %, a country like Finland, which is well above the European average, rises 5 %, a country like Lithuania drops by 23 %. I am talking about neighbouring countries that we can compare to see how unfair the cohesion strategy is coming out of the Commission's proposal and why? Because the Commission cut 45% of the Cohesion Fund without explanation and the Cohesion Fund balanced the ERDF and the European Social Fund.  This harms the poorest countries. There are many priorities in the European Union, but, Ms. von der Leyen, the issue of cohesion and convergence between Member States is central. He appealed here to unity.

I am glad that, however, when the spitzenkandidat process has already failed, the process of respecting the relative majority in this Parliament has succeeded.

I am especially pleased with your attitude towards gender equality, which you have emphasized. You have highlighted what your Commission will look like and how you will treat half the population of the world and the European Union.  What I have not heard much in your speech, and I believe that you will elaborate later, since I come from the youngest member of the European Union, Croatia, and I know that you have good relations with our Government, with our Defence Minister, however, I have not heard much about the differences between east and west, between north and south, the eurozone, non-eurozone, Schengen, non-Schengen. I think it is very important that enlargement to the Schengen zone happens after all and Croatia is one of the great candidates and I hope you will work on that. I would also like to hear a few words about your attitude towards enlargement to southeast Europe or the so-called Western Balkans.  What I was glad to hear in your speech was your attitude towards the economy. You said that people will not serve the economy, but the economy or the economy will serve people and we cannot spend more than we have earned, we should earn sooner and then share. I'm glad you treat it that way.  Also, your green green deal is to be welcomed, regardless of whether the Greens will vote for you, your green deal is important for the future, for the reasons of our children, for the sustainability. I'm glad you're taking care of that and it will be part of your portfolio.

I would ask you to further underline your support for Ireland in the future, as we had unwavering support from Jean-Claude Juncker, Michel Barnier, etc. Finally, I just want to say to you that gender equality is something that you are in the ideal position to lead and we look forward to that.

But we have to go further: we need to create a climate budget of 1000 billion each year to finance a real Marshall Plan for Africa, to finance a real research programme and to help all families, all small businesses in Europe to finance the transition. How do you find 1000 billion euros every year without taxing everyone? I think there is an urgent need to tackle European tax dumping. When I was little, the income tax was on average 400% in Europe, 40! It has fallen to 200% today, while profits and dividends are exploding. Only 200% in Europe, while in the United States it is stable, since Roosevelt, at 380%. Because when he arrived, Roosevelt had created a federal tax in just four months. So if we really want to win the climate battle, and I think you want to, my question is simple: can the next multi-year framework generate an additional budget of 1000 billion a year? Can we ask shareholders for an effort, with a tax of only 50%, and without affecting small businesses, without affecting craftsmen?

I will focus on three things. Firstly, Ms von der Leyen, I would like to congratulate you for striking the right balance on climate change, on energy policy and on protecting the environment. We have to do more in this area. We have to improve our energy efficiency. We have to reduce CO2 emissions, and we have to do it in a responsible way: by measuring the economic, the social, the environmental impact of the measures that we take; by standing by the side of the people and of the regions that are affected and by strengthening the economy, by strengthening the competitiveness of our economy. You are proposing an ambitious and a realistic approach. I think it is the correct one and I support it.  Secondly, you are proposing a convergence instrument for the euro area. This is needed, but my kind request to you would be to open this instrument also to countries which are not yet in the euro area but which are preparing to join, to allow countries that are preparing to join the euro area to contribute to this instrument, to benefit from it and to be part of the decision making. This would enable their accession to the euro area. It would strengthen the European economy, and it would also improve unity throughout the European Union.  Thirdly, as a Romanian Member of the European Parliament, I would like to say one word, and this is ‘Schengen’. Bulgaria and Romania have been fulfilling the conditions for joining the Schengen area since 2011 and we, the European Parliament, have demanded this several times. I would kindly request that you stand by the side of Parliament and that, together with us, you use the tools that you have at your disposal to enable Bulgaria and Romania’s accession to the Schengen area. This is the one topic that the citizens of Bulgaria and Romania are expecting most from the European Union. It will improve the security of the Schengen area, it will not dilute it.  To conclude, I would just like to say: we are a diverse Parliament. We are different. We are not the same. But from what I saw today from the President-designate in her guidelines and in her speech, I think she took all of our positions into account, and this is why I say she deserves the support of Parliament today.

Indeed, it has been mentioned many, many times that we had only two weeks to get to know each other. I’m here. It is a great honour for me to have had the opportunity to present the programme. Of course, we know that a speech is just a speech. It’s limited. But I think you have received today in your offices the guidelines that I laid out to all of us; so written down are details on the topics: a climate-neutral Europe in 2050, a more social and competitive Europe, a Europe that makes use of its full potential, a Europe that has a new push on European democracy and a strong Europe that protects our European way of life.  I am aware, when I listen to you and many, many arguments that there is the feeling of a division between central—eastern Europe and western Europe. We have to overcome that division. I’m full of respect when I think of the effort that the central European and the eastern European countries undertook and undertake to join the European Union, to join Schengen, to join the eurozone, and I think when they meet the criteria, this has to be rewarded.  I’m aware of the fact that there is still a certain division between south and north. I think I’ve elaborated extensively about how we could overcome that, how we find the right balance between responsibility and flexibility and the investment and growth that is needed, and where we will work together. I want to involve and be in closer toucher with this European Parliament and that’s why I support the right of initiative.

The failure of the two countries to be commissioner is all the more reprehensible as we are facing the debate over the next 7 years of the budget.", "language": "en", "original_language": "et", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "Renew", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 101, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Marek Paweł BALT", "mepid": "197495", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. – I will vote in favour of Ursula von der Leyen's candidature because I was convinced by her commitments made in the political declaration.

As a former member of this forum, I know very well and appreciate the special role that the European Parliament and you have in the European decision-making process. I would like to congratulate you and wish you every success in your mandate. Ladies and gentlemen, it has been important to show that the European institutions work for citizens and, above all, that they produce results that improve their lives and offer prospects for the future. I am pleased to say that Romania has succeeded. We have taken on and assumed this responsibility as a mission to serve citizens and European unity. We felt it necessary for all our actions to be built around cohesion as a common European value. Romania has demonstrated that it can perform successfully against the background of challenges and trends that call into question the Union's determination to progress. We have demonstrated Romania's ability to contribute to the added value of the European Union, which is reflected in the consistent balance sheet we are handing over: 90 completed legislative dossiers and around 2,500 events and organised meetings. At the same time, we facilitated the adoption of 84 Council conclusions on multiple topics of common interest. We wanted to have visible, lasting results through the exercise of this mandate, to which citizens could relate easily and clearly. These results give a genuine identity to our first Presidency, to which I believe we can all relate. For example, I would like to think that when a European citizen has more equitable and transparent access to the labour market, allowing him to better balance his work with his or her private life, he will know that these decisions were taken during Romania's presidency. I also want to believe that the European citizen will feel safer and more protected within the union's borders and because of the efforts of our Presidency. We have managed to make a qualitative leap in this direction. From now on, more effective checks at the external borders will be possible, we will improve the security of identity cards. We have achieved consistent results on all four priority pillars of the Presidency: Europe of Convergence, Europe of Safety, Europe, global actor, Europe of common values. Within the Europe of Convergence Pillar, Romania's Presidency has made intensive efforts to advance negotiations on the future Multiannual Financial Framework 2021-2027, both at the political and sectoral levels. We have also succeeded in finalising negotiations on a considerable number of legislative dossiers aimed at strengthening the Banking Union and the Capital Markets Union, and we have secured a long-term vision for the single market. At the same time, the concrete results achieved in areas such as the internal market, in all its dimensions – energy, social affairs or climate change – are elements that will remain landmarks and are already being taken up by our partners in the trio, Finland and Croatia.  At the same time, the challenges of the digital age, of which artificial intelligence, were addressed by the first set of Union conclusions dedicated to this theme. Our Presidency has made an important contribution to the completion of the Digital Single Market through the Digital Single Market Copyright Directive. In all our endeavours, we have sought to place the interests of the citizen at the heart of our vision. Strengthening the social dimension of the Union was thus a priority and the establishment of the European Labour Authority an example of success. From the perspective of the Energy Union, we have adopted the proposal to amend the Natural Gas Directive, which will ensure, for the first time, a uniform and transparent regulatory framework on gas interconnections with third countries. We also aimed to facilitate reflection on the development of a common long-term vision towards climate neutrality. We have adopted the first regulations in the field of emission standards for heavy vehicles.  The safety Europe – the second pillar – was the framework in which we acted to increase security at European Union level, in view of the expectations of our citizens. We have strengthened the mandate of the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, and by adopting interoperability legislation, we are sending a clear signal that information systems at European level must complement each other. This is an excellent example of further cooperation between Member States to strengthen the internal security and functionality of the Schengen area, an objective in which Romania wishes to continue to participate fully.  In the area of migration, we have worked to advance negotiations on the reform of the European asylum and migration policy. Even with the continuation of divergences on this issue, we have been able to move forward negotiations on the Return Directive and discussions on the development of temporary commitments. We have also completed negotiations for the functioning of the European network of migration liaison officers. In order to improve the response to cyber-attacks, a sanctions framework has been adopted to respond to cyber attacks. Thus, for the first time, sanctions will be imposed on persons involved in cyber-attacks that threaten the Union or the Member States. Romania will continue to act in this area, pursuing the objective of hosting a European agency specialised in this.  Looking to the external dimension of our work, reflected in the global player Europe Pillar, we have invested consistent efforts to strengthen the profile of an active and effective Union, involved in its neighbourhood and credible by honouring its international commitments. Progress has been made in relevant areas, such as the Western Balkans region, the Eastern Partnership, the Black Sea region. Enlargement is a geostrategic investment in the economic, political and security well-being of the European Union. In the Western Balkans, we managed, against the background of a complex context, to preserve the remarkable, and even historical, developments that were recorded last year, and to maintain the strategic opportunities created for partners in the region, I mean Albania and North Macedonia.  The relevance of our objectives is major in the Europe pillar of common values. The phenomenon of disinformation is indisputable and, therefore, we have forwarded to the European Council the report on combating misinformation and ensuring fair European elections. Another major objective of our presidency was to combat anti-Semitism, xenophobia, hate speech and all forms of intolerance. We hope that these efforts will be continued by our partners in the trio. We believe that promoting equal opportunities and gender is a major objective, which has also been found in the architecture of the new European institutions, the European Parliament and the European Commission.  We have assumed that we will act towards strengthening the European project and, during the six months of our mandate, we have demonstrated that pro-Europeanism must be fuelled by constant action. I have been personally and with all my dedication to the proper conduct of this Presidency and for personal motivation, determined by my deep attachment to the ideal of the European project. I am part of the generation that has matured with this aspiration to the fullness of European integration and its recognition for Romania. I believe that this sense of recognition of the significance that the European Union has for citizens needs to be constantly cultivated through concrete results. Our project must not promote a multi-speed Europe or concentric circles. Romania will continue to promote the common objective of strengthening the European project and will at the same time pursue the completion of its integration. I am referring here, of course, to the full integration of our country into the Schengen area, where we are already acting as a de facto member. We will continue to act in a pragmatic manner to promote the principles of the Sibiu Declaration and remain deeply attached to respect for democratic values and the rule of law. It is important, however, that there are no differences between Member States, fault lines that create different standards for European citizens.  By exercising the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, Romania has confirmed full membership, which shows us the legitimacy of our aspirations to conclude the Cooperation and Verification Mechanism. I still firmly believe that our future, for all of us, cannot be imagined any other way, except within a stronger and more cohesive Europe, for which we have worked with enthusiasm, confidence and professionalism over the last six months. I am convinced that the efforts of the Romanian Presidency at the Council of the European Union are a consistent basis for further advancing the European agenda in the coming period and Wish success to the Finnish Presidency of the Council of the European Union. Thank you and thank you for your support in these six months, for your good cooperation, and I am convinced that the rotating presidency held by Romania in these six months will remains both in Romania's memory and in the memory of the European Union as a successful presidency.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 110, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Viorica DĂNCILĂ", "mepid": "95281", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, it’s always a pleasure to be in this Chamber and especially today because this morning you have been debating the vision and the expectations for our common Europe for the next five years.

Because for Europe to succeed, we must play as a team, guided by the European art of compromise and in defence of the common European interest.  I believe that this was the case not only during the Romanian Presidency that we are summing up here this afternoon, but also it was the spirit of our work during the last five years.  Let me thank Prime Minister Dăncilă for the efforts that Romania took to advance our Europe further.

In this regard, I would like to congratulate the Romanian Presidency, President Klaus Iohannis, Prime Minister Viorica Dăncilă, the ministers and the brilliant Romanian Ambassador to the European Union, Luminiţa Odobescu, for the excellent work and the many achievements. You invested significant efforts in closing as many legislative files as possible before the last plenary session of the previous European Parliament in April. It was really a political sprint because you managed to close 90 files in the first 100 days of your term, and that’s a testament to your tenacity and dedication.  I am thinking in particular of the strengthening of the European Border and Coast Guard, the Copyright Directive, or the European Gas Directive, which was particularly difficult to conclude and therefore my colleague Energy and Climate Commissioner Miguel Arias Cañete also decided to join me today to express also his appreciation for the hard work on this very important piece of legislation.  But I also think about the progress we have made on our Social Agenda, which was a top priority of this Commission from the very beginning. Thanks to the work of the Romanian Presidency we have now higher minimum standards for working parents and carers. We have increased the possibility for men to take up caring responsibilities and we are giving more support to women’s participation in the labour market. We have made contracts and working conditions more transparent and predictable for all types of work, particularly atypical forms of work such as on-demand or part-time work, and less than a year after we made a proposal to establish the European Labour Authority, the Romanian Presidency made this a reality. Regarding the next multiannual financial framework, the Romanian Presidency also did excellent work on the negotiating box and on advancing discussions on the sectoral proposals. Very good progress has been made, including on one of the most critical points, the euro area budgetary instrument. Let us take this forward with determination with the next Presidencies.  We all know how complex the budget negotiation can be, but ultimately it is a matter of political will and we now need to take the decision that will create certainty and stability for the future of our citizens and for our businesses.  Romania has proven that in this challenging year of institutional change in Europe, our Union is breathing with both lungs, east and west. We could certainly feel this at the Sibiu summit on 9 May. This was an important moment for both the European Union and Romania. We could see how brightly the European colours could shine.  The resulting Sibiu Declaration of the 27 EU leaders is a strong message of commitment to each other to build a European future together.  To conclude, let me add, as the Commission has already said in the past, that we believe Romania should be a full member of the Schengen area and I can only call again for the Member States to put Romania in its deserved place in our borderless Europe.  I also would like to say, as the Commission has outlined in the past, that efforts regarding the rule of law and fight against corruption are crucial and must be upheld, because people deserve this.  And my last sentence would be again aimed at, I would say, my personal experience with your country. I visited it many times before and after the big changes in our part of the world, so I can testify to and be a witness of how big the progress is that your country has made over the last few years and therefore your first Presidency should be something the whole nation should be proud of because you did a great job for which I really would like to thank you and I will try to say it in Romanian as well, mulțumesc.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 111, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Andrey KOVATCHEV", "mepid": "97968", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, first of all, on behalf of the PPE Group, allow me to congratulate President Iohannis and you, Prime Minister, and your government, the people of Romania and everybody involved for making your country’s first Presidency a success. You have assumed responsibility at a challenging time for Europe, a period marked by the impending departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union, the ongoing discussions about the future shape of the EU project and institutional renewal, starting with the European elections. Against this background, you have faced high expectations to deliver on legislation, but also to provide guidance on set priorities for the future. During the Romanian Presidency, the EU made good progress on several important issues such as the digital single market, the Gas Directive and the Banking Union. The Commissioner has already talked about some of them.  Together we have also achieved a strong commitment at EU level for the European enlargement perspective for the Western Balkans. We welcome the decision of the Romanian Presidency to keep this important topic on the agenda of the European Union. After a ten-year break, the Sofia summit during the Bulgarian Presidency provided a much—needed tangible roadmap for the European future of this region. We highly value the efforts of both the Austrian and the Romanian Presidency in sustaining and furthering this impetus. It is time to face reality. A weakening of enlargement momentum could easily cause setbacks for the reform agenda in the region and create openings for other third countries to gain greater influence – a situation which, to put it mildly, won’t be in the interests of the European Union. The Romanian Presidency started with the motto ‘cohesion, a common European value’. Indeed, a more cohesive Europe is a stronger Europe.  Many important files have been successfully closed. I would like especially to highlight the agreement on the regulation on the European Border and Coast Guard. Strengthening our border control capacity has been a longstanding priority for the PPE Group. The most important freedom that our citizens enjoy is free travel within the European Union. We can only guarantee this freedom if we secure our external borders to monitor who is crossing them at all times. In regard to my country, Bulgaria, we set a good example on this securing of the external border. We have ensured a high level of protection of our external border also with the help of EU solidarity, which guarantees the security of the whole of Europe. The PPE Group is in favour of a stronger European Border and Coast Guard with increased resources and capacities ready to deploy immediately whenever a country faces disproportionate migratory pressure. We support the reinforcement of Frontex with 10 000 new border guards to help national border enforcement officers. Another key topic was the debate on the Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF) for the next programming period. The PPE Group wants an ambitious Europe and we need the means to match our ambitions. We cannot expect the EU to deliver on expectations to European citizens if we do not give them the tools to be effective and adapt to the changing world. Although we would have liked the negotiations to be finalised before the European elections, we commend the Romanian Presidency for the good progress achieved in the first half of this year. It is important that we do not reduce the share of the total EU budget allocated to cohesion policy measures post—2020. The European structural and investment funds contribute to improving our infrastructure and closing socioeconomic gaps between regions, but also fight poverty and here Romania – but also all of us – need to do much more by fighting poverty in our Union.  Nevertheless, we would have also appreciated the Romanian Presidency getting better results on the external neighbourhood discussion and improvement on the Schengen enlargement talks. Unfortunately, the Council is still not willing to grant access for Romania and Bulgaria to the Schengen area. The U-turn at the helm of the Council coincided with the negotiations for the appointment of the European Public Prosecutor. The PPE Group strongly supports the efforts to combat fraud affecting the financial interest of the European Union. But of course our Union is not only financial; it is also based on values. Let us not forget that the EU is founded on the shared values of democracy, the rule of law and respect for fundamental rights. The rule of law is a fundamental value that we, the members of the PPE Group, care about. Finally, the role of the Presidency is not only to ensure the day-to-day management of the European agenda, but also to set strategic priorities for the future. Here an important success was the EU summit organised in Sibiu by President Iohannis. EU leaders signed the Sibiu Declaration and agreed upon the main steps towards a more united, stronger and democratic Union.  We have received a strong mandate from our citizens. More than 50% of citizens voted in the European elections. Now it’s time for the Finnish Presidency to continue the work and work together with us and the President of the European Commission, who we hope will be elected this afternoon, to realise the ambitious programme presented by Ms von der Leyen in the plenary this morning. Thank you very much again for all your efforts. I am looking forward to the Finnish Presidency.

It was not an easy task, not only because of the scale of the challenges, with the uncertainty of Brexit, but also because of the short period of time to work. It was a short presidency, because of the European elections, but undoubtedly one of the most fruitful. And that is why I have to congratulate the Romanian Government and I am pleased to be able to welcome its Prime Minister, Viorica Duncil, to this chamber today. The good work of his Government has facilitated numerous agreements, and good work has also done an important job in paving the way for a potential uk exit from the European Union so that the impact is as smooth as possible for both British citizens and other Union citizens. Because that has been the axis of his Presidency: to respond to the needs of the public. The Presidency had as its central theme cohesion, which is one of the expressions of solidarity between citizens and also solidarity between the territories. We know that many regions of Europe are depopulated because young people do not see a future. That is why prioritizing the Europe of convergence has been a success. We want the European Union to take advantage of new technologies and ecological transformation to create new opportunities in all the territories of the Union. In just four months, the Romanian Presidency has managed to close eighty legislative files and ten major institutional agreements. Among the most important successes of this Presidency, let me highlight all the preparatory work and agreements on sectoral proposals for the Multiannual Financial Framework for the next seven years. This Community budget which we must close as soon as the European Commission is launched is fundamental to the now-beginning legislature. Only with a strong budget can we carry out the policies that citizens are waiting for of us and us. The Romanian Presidency has succeeded in promoting measures to strengthen the social pillar, with greater protection of workers through a Directive on fair working conditions and the establishment of the European Labour Authority, issues which were fundamental to us. And another issue that will allow me to move here as one of the great achievements of the last legislature has been the adoption of a Directive to advance the reconciliation of personal and professional life, which includes for the first time paid paternity leave. During these months the Romanian Government has promoted the Europe of solidarity, justice, equal opportunities and gender equality, but also the values of diversity, which are so necessary in the face of those who want to take advantage of fear of the different. That is why I congratulate you on your initiatives to combat racism and xenophobia, as well as all forms of intolerance.

At the technical level, Romanian officials and diplomats were able to complete 90 legislative and non-legislative files. That's why I want to congratulate the professionals behind the scenes, those who too rarely receive the word \"thank you\" for the work done in these (word that is not understood).  The same cannot be said of the political echelon of this presidency. Regrettably, I must say that the current government in Bucharest was far too preoccupied with the problems with the judiciary of its leaders to secure the ambitious presidency. This lack of political ambition has also been matched by anti-European and populist rhetoric from the ruling parties. Fortunately, this rhetoric was drastically sanctioned by Romanian citizens in the vote on 26 May.  Romania has proven that it is much more than the politicians who represent it. Romania means, first of all, citizens who have queued to vote for a European Romania. They certainly deserved more from this opportunity that comes every 14 years. After this Presidency, the Council remains indebted in the political plan on several sensitive and very important dossiers which it has failed to move forward in recent months. I would mention here only three of these.  Firstly, there is a need to unblock discussions on the Multiannual Financial Framework. It is not acceptable to repeat the mistake of the previous financial framework when delayed adoption led to the postponement of national partnership contracts and the final beneficiaries were affected. We need to ensure sufficient resources for agricultural policy and for a cohesion policy that ensures real convergence between the east and west of the continent. We need more Europe in health and education, both in terms of allocating funds and for adopting minimum quality standards at European level.  Secondly, there is a need to unblock the appointment of the Chief Prosecutor of the European Public Prosecutor's Office as soon as possible. The blocking of the appointment was a political one, and the unblocking must also be an act of political will. I expect the Finnish Presidency of the Council to come to the negotiating table with Parliament as soon as possible in order to reach an agreement. Thirdly, we need to move forward on migration and border management issues. The Council, together with the new Parliament and the new Commission, must open a frank and direct dialogue about the future of the Schengen area, a future that leaves no Member State behind and that no longer calls into question the growing practice of internal border controls.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 114, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Philippe LAMBERTS", "mepid": "96648", "text": "  on behalf of the Greens/FTA group. Mr. Speaker, welcome, Madam Prime Minister, it is always a pleasure to have a head of state or government here. I insist because I know that some people in this House would like to discredit the Council by saying that the Council is not legitimate. You have legitimacy, as do each and every head of state and government, but you obviously have a special responsibility when it comes your turn to hold the presidency. It was the first time for Romania and it is true that, in terms of organisational work, administrative work, we can take our hat off: clearly, Romania has succeeded in its first stint at the head of the Council. It is true that in an election year, when you know that the pressure to complete a certain number of files is enormous, it is rather a successful performance, I want to say. Now, among these files, there are some that are not among the 90 files that have been completed under your presidency and that are emblematic files. The Council itself, at each of its meetings, agitated the asylum and migration file as the file file, the most important file, the one that would suffer no delay, no other priority before it. What do I need to see? It has been four years since the Council has said this, at every conclusion of the Heads of State and Government: migration, migration, migration, migration, border, border and what else do I know. We are still waiting for a position from the Council on the reform of asylum and migration, this package proposed, years ago, by the Commission, and on which this Parliament voted by an overwhelming majority - I said this morning - of five political groups, already two years ago. What have you done to get things done? One of the roles, perhaps less visible, of presidents is to unlock, is to put oil in the gears. Of course not! You have simply acted on the fact that you have decided that the Council will decide unanimously, when this is not justified, and unanimity obviously means that any Member State can block everything. And imagine that there is more than one Member State that is prepared to block everything on this subject. This means that on this subject, which you yourself say is extremely important, you do nothing! Nothing! You, like all the other Member States: from that point of view, none of the 28 is better than the others. Then there is this other aspect, which was mentioned by my predecessor, that of reputation. When a state presides over the European Union, it is absolutely crucial that that state, somewhere, embodies, represents the values of the Union. What show does your government give us? I say your government, I am not talking about Romania. Romania, like Hungary, like Poland, which is often talked about, like all the countries of the European Union, has a place in the European Union. Nevertheless, the government that now runs this country is a government that distinguished itself by brutally suppressing peaceful protests last summer - it was certainly not during the presidency, but nevertheless in your country, it was your government. It is a government that works almost obsessively to bring the judiciary under control in order, of course, to prevent politicians from being convicted of corruption and declared ineligible. It seems that this absorbs most of the political energy of the parties that are in power in your country today. And from this point of view, I note that the many reports made by the Council of Europe, by the Venice Commission but also by the anti-corruption body of the Council of Europe, remain a dead letter. To top it all off, as my predecessor said, you are allowing yourself to block the possible appointment to the post, which is very important in the European Union, as head of the European Public Prosecutor's Office of Laura Codru-a Kovesi, whom we have still not had the opportunity to audition. So no, frankly, the spectacle that your government offers does not honour Europe and, I would say, does not honour Romania.

For the Conference of Presidents with the Council of Ministers, of course, in November, but also last April for a debate on the future of Europe. Each time, we have talked about the great challenges that Europeans and their common civilization will have to face together, on a continental scale: identity and borders, the relocation of the economy, but also data protection, artificial intelligence, the necessary re-industrialisation or the maintenance of our agricultural fabric. So far, on none of these issues has the European Union been able to be effective or even present. Worse, on free trade, it is only accelerating, even recently with Latin American countries or Vietnam. Yet it is the least environmentally friendly and most destructive system in our economies. I say this without, of course, throwing the stone at the Romanian government. It must be said that it has been under heavy fire from the European Commission, which is exploiting the rule of law to impose the joint government of technocrats and judges in the face of the will of the peoples. The reality is that power is now being pagocytized by the Brussels Commission, which combines both the legislative initiative and the monitoring of the application of directives, but also acts as a guarantor of the treaties. However, the presidencies of the Council pass, but the Commission, its bureaucrats and its guidelines remain. Is not the best example of Mr Timmermans, who will no doubt retain his role as a zealous \"flag-bearer\" against countries that are recalcitrant in Brussels. He who, against Hungary, against Poland, against Romania, tomorrow perhaps against Matteo Salvini's Italy, in short against the nations and against the peoples, will always be at the forefront of attacking and destabilizing governments that nevertheless have democratic legitimacy. In the recent small arrangements to allocate the posts at the head of the European institutions, Eastern Europe has been completely forgotten. Merkel's Germany is, as always, over-represented, in person, or by her supporters or by her straw men. Those who precipitated the enlargement of the European Union to the East now realize that their liberal-libertarian immigrationist ideology is very little shared. Having suffered the yoke of totalitarian communism, the countries of Central and Eastern Europe still know how to develop courageous leaders who refuse to give in to the Commission's demands, particularly with regard to the compulsory distribution of migrants. It is on this issue, and especially that of the reform of the right of asylum, which has become a misguided channel of illegal immigration, that the Juncker Commission has skidded. Fortunately, the Dublin IV reform was blocked in the Council, notably by Hungary and Poland. If the Romanian Presidency, in juxtaposition with the European elections, has not been an opportunity for spectacular progress, let us at least acknowledge that it has not amplified or aggravated the current failures and excesses of the European Union. In view of the pledges it has given to the Socialists and macroist liberals this morning, the appointment of Mrs von der Leyen as head of the Commission would, on the other hand, risk further acceleration, with the Finnish Presidency, towards more federalism, more immigration and less economic protections. The defenders of peoples and nations will therefore be more vigilant than ever to refuse to let the European Union become a machine to destroy Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 116, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Ruža TOMAŠIĆ", "mepid": "119431", "text": "  on behalf of the ECR Club. - Dear President, romania's first Presidency of the Council came at a challenging time when the European Union was preparing for the UK's exit and welcoming elections to the European Parliament. Romania has shown that even in such somewhat chaotic circumstances, a good job can be done when there are clear goals and strategies on how to achieve them. The Romanian Presidency will be remembered for a large number of important initiatives and some key agreements with the European Parliament, such as the Gas Directive, the Digital Europe Programme, the European Union's first space programme, the first carbon dioxide emission standards for freight vehicles or the European Coast and Border Guard initiative. While more could have been done in some areas, such as migrant and asylum policy, the Romanian Presidency should nevertheless serve as an example for newer members to play an important and constructive role in this community. Unfortunately, those who should not have seen in the Romanian example the opportunity to restore trust between east and west, old and new members, but in the election of new leaders of the EU institutions further marginalised the European East and new members. It is a bad message mainly to young democracies that strive to reach the democratic and economic standards of the developed West, while respecting both their own and other people's traditions. With this choice of EU leaders, the new members have been re-labelled second-rate, although recently one of them, Romania, has proven that it has both ambitions and knowledge in recent Europe to contribute actively to the development of European policies and this community. I fear that this misunderstanding of the young democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, which have had a different development path, is growing year after year. The old members, it is now quite clear, want to reaffirm their dominance in making strategic decisions for Europe. We can still learn a lot from them, but as partners, not masters. A new Europe must not agree to a vassal relationship. We ask that our identity, our culture, our history and our traditions be respected.

You have to your credit that you managed to close several pending files, and this is recorded in the positives of the Romanian Presidency, but the major issues that concern us as the European Union, as the European Parliament, and which also concern the citizens of the Member States have been left outstanding. They didn't move on.  The citizens' demand for a stronger Community budget, which supports and does not weaken cohesion policies, has not moved forward, because regional and social disparities are being reinforced.

Since I do not want to be unfair, I would like to say that positive steps have also been taken, such as the preparation by the Council, under the Romanian Presidency, of sanctions against the aggression of the Turkish leadership, which violates international law. And I am sure that the Finnish Presidency will also continue on this path, because we must support European values when they are threatened by aggressive behaviour by the European Union's neighbours. I also think it is good that, in the area of south-eastern Europe, you have tried to continue the positive example opened by the Prespas agreement between my country – Greece – and Northern Macedonia and I believe that the new Government of Greece, contrary to what it said pre-election, will continue to respect and implement this agreement.  I shall end, Mrs Dăncilă, with an appeal to you, on behalf not only of my political groups but also of many non-governmental organisations – and I know that the Commission also shares this appeal: I ask you now to stop the barbaric transfer, in miserable circumstances, of 70,000 sheep from Romania to the Persian Gulf, because this violates every concept of culture, which must respect both human and animal rights.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "GUE/NGL", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Left-wing"}, {"id": 118, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Jake PUGH", "mepid": "197813", "text": "   – Mr President, we in the Brexit party like to expect that we’re going to be making the most unpopular speeches in this place, but I think the contributions from the gentlemen from Renew and the Greens have set a pretty high bar: trying to tell you, Madam Prime Minister, how you should be running your own country. Pretty remarkable. But in the context of the outgoing Romanian Presidency, I would like to congratulate in particular Simona Halep on her stunning performance at Wimbledon on Saturday. It was a performance of poise, power and precision and, most importantly, she will have inspired millions of young girls at home and abroad to participate in sport. Collective Romanian pride in her performance stems in part because it is a strong expression of identity and nationhood. Note I said ‘nationhood’, not ‘nationalism’. I was going to make the point to the Lib Dems but I note they’re not here. Romanian flags flew proudly over the weekend from Bucharest to Baia Mare, but I didn’t hear one rendition of the EU anthem. Sport can do more than almost anything else to bring people together. Tragically, in contrast, whatever the intentions of the European project, it divides more than it unites. But at the conclusion of the Romanian Presidency, and coming back to the four pillars, you mentioned, Prime Minister, let’s judge it against its own priorities. Just two. You talked about convergence through economic growth and employment. Economic growth in the EU is now at the lowest it is been for the last three years. Youth unemployment in Romania is 16%; it is 20% in France; 30% in Italy and Spain; 40% in Greece. Entire generations of young people, their lives laid waste at the altar of the European ideal. Secondly, developing the EU defence capability. So, having refused to pay for its share of European defence, the EU now wants its own army. That can only encourage those who wish to harm us and will undermine the security of Europe through NATO. For those of you who will remain in this place when the UK leaves very shortly, you may look for more from the Finnish Presidency, but I suspect that will be a triumph of hope over expectation. So rather than celebrating the efforts of the Romanian Presidency, let’s celebrate the success of Simona Halep, a real symbol of Romanian pride, a far better use of our time and less damaging to the economy and security of Europe.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "NI", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Non-Inscrits"}, {"id": 119, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Jake PUGH", "mepid": "197813", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank the honourable Members of this Parliament for highlighting the challenges which we have to confront when we are going to build and strengthen our common and undivided European Union.

I would also like to thank the Members for highlighting the successes of the Romanian Presidency, as Mr Kovatchev did, especially in the listing all the important files which have been concluded thanks to the professionalism of Romanian negotiators and Romanian diplomats and ministers.  I would also like to recognise the good cooperation we had with the Romanian Presidency in completing and concluding all very important files on better tackling climate change.  A lot has been done, in record time. The Romanian Presidency was starting at the beginning of the very crucial transitional year, where the time for real legislative work was very, very short, but it was well spent, it was done very professionally. For that, I really would like to thank you and highlight the fact that you managed this very demanding work despite the fact that it was your first presidency. I know how much each new Member State gains in the form of experience, in the form of establishing good working contacts with other partners in the EU and with European institutions, and therefore I believe that it was not only investment into the future of the European Union but it will also translate into even more professional work by the Romanian civil service and I’m sure that all that experience and all that work, which was invested in Europe, will also be felt back in Romania.

Indeed, Romania held the rotating presidency at a challenging time, which the European Union has not had before. I am referring to the Brexit process, I am referring to the fact that it was the European Parliament elections, which has caused all the work of the rotating presidency to take place in the first part, in the 100 days. It's true, we wish in 100 days we'd closed 100 files. We have only closed ninety, but I believe that Romania has taken steps forward and, indeed, Mr Vice-President, for Romania is a cause for celebration. It is a cause for celebration for the whole people, for all those who believe in Romania and those who want to represent Romania with dignity. It is true that we could have done more things, that we would have liked to have done more things, but it is not easy to build consensus between 28 Member States where the priorities are different. We know that during the rotating presidency we have to be a very good mediator and a facilitator of consensus, and I believe that this has done Romania and managed to achieve these results. With regard to the multiannual financial framework, it is true, I am convinced that the new Parliament, that the European institutions will achieve results in terms of financial projection. But also in this chapter Romania has taken important steps, also with regard to cohesion policy, and with regard to the common agricultural policy. Projects can continue, but, of course, for a project to have the efficiency we all want, it must be matched by an appropriate financial projection. We chose the main theme - cohesion - because we believe that cohesion is needed. We need unity at European Union level, because only if we show cohesion will we be able to take important steps and maybe take bigger steps on our own, but I am convinced that we will take good steps together. That is why I believe that cohesion is very important, not only during the rotating presidency, but cohesion must guide the actions of the European institutions in the future. Mr. Tudorache, I'll answer you specifically. It was not Romania's officials and diplomats who did, they carried out the presidency. The Presidency was led by the Romanian government. At each meeting, the Minister presided over the work, it was a very good cooperation, for which I congratulated our experts, all those who were involved, all those who really acted for Romania and not against Romania.  A few minutes earlier someone asked me: \"Do you think that Romanian MEPs will be united in bringing an extra image to Romania?\" Now I leave disappointed, with people like you, we will not bring an addition to Romania. Let's solve the problems at home, don't come with them to the European Parliament, because these things don't add to our country's image. Moreover, everyone congratulated the Romanian presidency. There have also been things that some MEPs thought we could do better, but they did not criticise and you will not see here in Parliament a lot of MEPs who criticise their country. But you did it when the Vice-President of the European Commission said that Romania has a cause for celebration. Moreover, I want to tell you that the European Union, research inga little ahead, has no powers on health, education and culture. It comes with projects. So you also talked about three elements that you don't know. And I think you know nothing about the achievements of the Romanian Presidency. You do not know that during the presidency a country cannot intervene. He has to be a facilitator of consensus. That is what Romania has done, and I would have been glad if this project, which is particularly important for my country, this rather important and very important project for all European citizens, would have found consensus, because we found consensus at the European Commission, we found consensus at the European Council, we found consensus among many MEPs, we found consensus in the President of the European Parliament , and we all understand that the European Union is at a turning point and, if we do not act together, we will not make good sense of European construction.  We listened to all the advice and, together, we achieved these things. I believe that they must guide us over the next period, to bring added value. Citizens don't need scandal. Citizens need things to help them in their daily lives, policies closer to them, not things to bring into the public space, believing that we have more political significance. Mr. Lamberts, I'm sorry he left, on the logistics side, I liked this \"Down with the Hat\", I think Romania deserves this. For us all the dossiers were important, and in relation to GRECO, we look at every point at GRECO, but I think we need to to look at Belgium, the country of which it is a part. There are 15 recommendations, of which he has implemented only one. We must let GRECO not interfere and the magistrates intervene. If, indeed, we want independence of justice, we need magistrates to find consensus, not implement it ourselves.  Finally, I want to thank everyone. I want to thank all those who trusted us, because your trust was not only trust in the Romanian government, it was not only trust in our experts, in our diplomats, it was trust in a country that held for the first time the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, a country that gave its first examination in this position and which I believe , and I saw that many of you consider the same, that it passed with flying colors. Thank you once again for your involvement, for your support, for the way we have cooperated. I wish, once again, success to the new Parliament, and I hope that you will have here, in this very important European forum, in which we have been active for nine years, to be successful, because your success is the success of all European construction.", "language": "en", "original_language": "ro", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 121, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "David Maria SASSOLI", "mepid": "96864", "text": "   Thank you, the debate is closed.

Let me start by congratulating you all either for your election or re-election, but also let me start by congratulating the new President-elect of the Commission. Ursula and I have been working together very well in these last few years, in particular on our common work for the European Union’s defence. I am sure that the Commission will be in good hands. Among the things on which we have worked together – Ursula and I and also defence and foreign ministers of the Member States, some of them I see them are sitting in this Hemicycle now as Members of the European Parliament – is the global strategy that we drafted and then put in place three years ago. The global strategy has been the compass of our work in these five years, in these last three years and the preparation and the drafting of it in the previous ones. I want to thank the previous European Parliament for its support in drafting the strategy, but most of all in turning this into action. The global strategy was the outcome of a truly collective work with all the 28 Member States of the European Union and with many Members of Parliament playing a key role, Members of the European Parliament, but also members of national parliaments and civil society, think-tanks. It was really a collective work, and it was the opportunity to focus on values and interests, both of them, that we all shared as Europeans beyond political families and beyond ideological debates. We agreed that we needed to strengthen and consolidate our role as a global security provider. We agreed that the great challenges of our times require multilateral solutions, and we agreed that Europe can only matter – and it does matter, it does make a difference – in the world if we act as one Union. Of course there is much more than this in the global strategy and you have probably seen, I hope, the global strategy itself, but also the report that I presented last month to the Foreign Affairs Council after discussing the content of this report with the Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET) and the Committee on Development (DEVE) in the previous mandates in April. We have put together 50 very dense pages of achievements, and also possible options for the future, and this is the work that I delivered to you for future consideration on how to use the instruments that we’ve put in place, how to shape the future foreign and security policy of the European Union. So there’s much more than these three concepts in the global strategy, but let me focus for the moment on these three points: security and defence, multilateralism, and the idea of a more joined-up and more effective. European Union. First of all on defence. We have shown that this European Union knows how to deliver if there is political will. In some cases we have achieved even more than we hoped and expected in this field. When we started talking about setting up the Permanent Structural Cooperation on Defence, many were sceptical, and I remember very well, I discussed this for the very first time during my own hearing five years ago in the joint AFET and DEVE committees. Yet, even with all the scepticism and resistance that was there, we did it, and we went even further with the European Defence Fund and the Coordinated Annual Review on Defence. And these are not just names or acronyms. This is real change for our common security. We are helping Member States to make their defence spending more efficient and developing all the military capabilities that we need, from the skies to the sea, to cyberspace. Our international missions now have better command structures, and we have committed to investing more in our civilian action. That remains the pride of the European Union. In short, the European Union of Security and Defence has finally taken its first concrete steps after so many decades, when it was only on paper or not even on paper. At the same time as we strengthened ourselves, we have also strengthened our security and defence cooperation with partners all around the world, starting with NATO, but well beyond it. I’ve just come back from the Central African Republic, for example, where we are working with the European Union, men and women under our flag, alongside the UN Peacekeepers, and before that, just a few days ago, I was in the Sahel, where we were helping the G5 Sahel countries to set up their own multinational military force. The second point I would like to stress is multilateralism. Europe is a cooperative and multilateral power by definition. It is the very same DNA of our European Union projects. In years where multilateralism, and also the UN system, have come under increasing pressure, we have invested in multilateralism like never before. We have stepped up our financial support to the United Nations. For instance, one example among many, saving the UN Agency for Palestinian Refugees from its funding crisis. We supported the UN Secretary-General’s reform agenda. But let me say, most importantly: we’ve always worked to find a multilateral solution to the many and difficult problems of our time. So not only are we defending the nuclear deal with Iran, promoting the Sustainable Development Goals, implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, creating a new generation of free and fair trade agreements, but we’ve always tried to build a multilateral framework where there was not one. After this debate we will talk about Venezuela. In the international contact group the European Union has contributed to efforts to solve the crisis, and I should also mention, as an example, the trilateral cooperation with the UN and the African Union, the Brussels conferences on Syria, and the regional meetings that we set up to support peace in Afghanistan. These are leading examples of our multilateral approach in concrete terms. And we haven’t just defended multilateralism. We have done so, but we have also renewed it with innovative new solutions. The third point I would like to stress is the way we work. This was a very important part of the global strategy three years ago and we have done a lot of work to improve the way in which we work inside the European Union. Here again, I want to thank the European Parliament’s previous mandate and I’m sure you will continue in this way for the support and the contribution to our efforts to increase the coherence and the coordination among institutions and within the institutions of the European Union. Throughout this work we’ve been the most successful when we’ve been united. This was the core idea of the global strategy. A more joined-up union is not just a principled choice, one that follows in the steps of our founding fathers and mothers, a joined-up Union is also the best way to make our action more effective. Only united do we really matter in the world of today. I often say there are not big and small Member States – there are Member States that are smaller Member States that have not yet understood they are small in the world of today – we can only be effective if we are united as Europeans, and only united can we advance our interests and our values. And when we do so, united, we do make a difference. Sometimes a vital one not just for us, but also for our partners all around the world. So in these years we have made a lot of progress, I believe, for instance, linking our policies on security and on development, or the internal and external side of our action through a more coordinated work within the Commission. Thanks to the group we have established with the Commissioners’ group on external action that I have convened regularly every month in these five years, and the EU Member States, for instance, have coordinated as never before in the Security Council of the United Nations, something that seemed impossible just three years ago. Our progress in these years on this point has been possible because of a collective political will to move forward, but I want to share this with you. I am very much aware that these achievements, everything that we have achieved in this field, could prove short-lived if political will fades away. And this is the message I deliver to you. Results need to be consolidated, and the new possibilities that we have opened in these last three or four years can now be explored and expanded, but this requires unity of purpose, determination and, most of all, political will. The European Parliament has been key to this progress. The Members of the Parliament have been very important actors in our foreign policy with their own diplomatic missions, with electoral observation, with the oversight of our policies, with a constant focus on human rights for which I want to thank your predecessors in this chamber. And again, I am sure that you will keep working in this direction. So your role is key. You have the final word on key fundamental issues that affect our foreign and security policy. You will have the final word on the new European Union budget. You will contribute to setting the direction of our foreign policy for the years ahead. So the call for a united Europe is stronger today than it was five years ago. I believe it will be even more urgent and pressing in the years ahead. The choice and the responsibility are yours, and I’m sure you will be able to respond to this call in the most effective way, in the most responsible way, continuing to invest in the global role of our European Union.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 130, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Michael GAHLER", "mepid": "2341", "text": "  Mr President, i.e. the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats Mr President, I would like to thank the First of all, I would like to express my delight at the election of Ursula von der Leyen as President of the Commission.

With unprecedented global uncertainty, the global strategy has enhanced EU security, strengthened our multilateral partnerships and reinforced our engagement in global governance. Remarkable progress was made in a number of areas: security and defence above all. We must build on this momentum with renewed efforts on crucial issues for the EU and for this House: first, a clear EU perspective for enlargement countries; second, a fair and sustainable management of migration; and third, a strong engagement with countries that our borders to an effective European neighbourhood policy. Yes, the world today is not better off than it was in 2016. Internally, our European values of democracy, solidarity and rule of law are challenged at their very foundations, and externally the unprecedented disengagement of great powers from multilateral platforms adds to outstanding security challenges and the destabilising consequences of climate change.

Mr President, Mrs Mogherini, as my colleagues have already said, three years ago, together with all the partners, we signed up the Global Strategy. At that time, that was really crucial, we were waiting here in Parliament. We wanted that compass for our foreign action in a world where Europe was full of menace. It was a very uncertain time, and with the Global Strategy there was a compass to bring more security to the world on this continent.  Today we are evaluating this, and I must tell you – you yourself have made it very clear – where there is political will, we have been able to achieve results, results that we can rightly be proud of. I am thinking of all the steps forward around European defence, PESCO, the missions, ... you cited them yourself. Bravo, really a step forward. But we must also mention the Peace Facility. Also the fact that we have shown ourselves a reliable partner. The deal with Iran is now under attack, but we have achieved results there too. For me, however, it is more important that we look to the future and that we look at where our work points lie and where we need to build on. We have today elected a new President of the Commission, Ursula von der Leyen. We had a very interesting debate with her. We need to get rid of that unanimity on foreign policy. Then we're going to be able to take more steps forward. As far as I am concerned, to be even more united and stronger Europe, even more committed to European defence. For me – really – the step towards a European army.  Finally, Mrs Mogherini, I would like to thank you. We have had very good debates here for many evenings. I want to thank you for that.

Ms Mogherini, you have given lavish praise to the EU Global Strategy so you will forgive me for adding a few criticisms. The EU Global Strategy – we read on the website of the European External Action Service – should be ‘a compass for our action in difficult times’. Well, I have a few question marks there. It’s a global strategy without geography. How can you have a global strategy without geography? It does not really answer the question of which policies are more promising than others and should take priority. In that regard, the strategy is not strategic. It also emphasises the need for prevention, resolution and stabilisation but, when we look at the proposed Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF), it’s just the opposite. The MFF proposes to slash most of the spending for these purposes and reduce it to a mere 40% of what we had before. So I think, if we take the strategy seriously, we should put our money where our mouth has been. I also believe that we should put more emphasis on climate urgency, which is completely underrated so far. So there’s a lot that should be improved.

Unfortunately, climate change is also affecting regions that have so far remained calm, like the Arctic, but the EU needs to invest more of its focus and develop a strategy to keep a lid on tensions in the Arctic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "Renew", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Liberals and centrists"}, {"id": 151, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Željana ZOVKO", "mepid": "185341", "text": "   – Mr President and esteemed High Representative, I welcome the Implementation Report of the EU Global Strategy.

Given the recent developments in the volatile international environment, the European Union, more than ever before, needs an ambitious implementation of this strategy.

It will help us to share our values, together with our interests across the world, in order to create a more balanced approach to multilateralism. I strongly welcome the action taken to improve the relations with our southern and eastern neighbours. We must focus on the cooperation with these regions, in particular, with the Western Balkans where established peace and security should not be taken for granted.

I would also like to thank those of you that have underlined the need to, in one sense, sustain and consolidate this work, but also to be consistent on those decisions.  Let me start with probably the most immediate task you will have in front of you, if you want to be consistent on the need to have a solid, reliable, credible, global player in our European Union. That is what some of you have mentioned: put the money where your priorities are. One of the first responsibilities this Parliament will have is the MFF, and let me say – just to mention a few numbers – that the proposal we’ve made for the next MFF, from the Commission side, is to increase the funds for the external action of the European Union by more or less 30%. This is needed in times of uncertainty in the world, because our partners look at Europe to find a reliable, credible partner that is predictable, someone you can cooperate with, someone that invests always in peace, democracy, human rights and cooperation. But this sometimes also requires adequate resources to sustain this work around the world.  So I hope that you will work in this direction in these next months. In particular, the proposal we put forward has an increase of 23% for the funds for Africa, and this is very important. We have increased a lot our work with Africa, not only in terms of development or humanitarian aid, but also in terms of partnership, political partnership, and work on peace and security. This work needs to be even more at the centre of our work in the future. 25% of those funds are dedicated to climate change in our proposal, and I really hope that this also can be supported and kept in your discussions on the next MFF. I won’t comment on the situation in Iran, because we will have a dedicated discussion later tonight – for those of you that are willing to spend the night in the Hemicycle – on the security situation around the Gulf. But let me stress, and you know already how important it is for all of us, collectively, to find a way to preserve the nuclear deal with Iran and also to avoid any escalation, and rather to de-escalate or to help actors to de-escalate around the Gulf. It is a vital interest of security concern for the European Union. As I mentioned climate change and climate action and diplomacy, let me also say that one of the other priorities clearly indicated in our work is the work on cyber-security. Security is not only military, it has also a much broader definition. We know that well, and also in that field there are some actions proposed – in the strategy, in the review of the strategy and the report on the strategy – that can be carried forward successfully in the future.  Let me also mention three other points. Firstly, some of you mentioned the need to have a credible enlargement policy. I personally believe, and this Commission believes, that giving a credible perspective for enlargement in the Western Balkans – to me even the word enlargement is not the appropriate one, because if you look at the geography, the Balkans, the Western Balkan countries, are all neighbouring European Union Member States – is a matter of the reconciliation and unity of our continent. It is also a matter of reconciliation in the region. I believe that, in particular, opening accession negotiations with North Macedonia and Albania is timely now, and I hope that the Council will take that decision in the coming months, and not later than that. It is an investment in our own security, stability, prosperity. I also see room for improvement on the work on migration. We have debated this here in this Hemicycle in the previous legislature several times. Some of you mentioned the good work that I started to do in Operation Sophia. On the external aspects of our migration policies, we have done a lot of good work. When I arrived five years ago, migration was not part of the external work of the Union at all. It was only an internal aspect of our policies. In these five years, we have established good partnerships with the countries of origin and transit. We have now 26 return agreements in place. We have good cooperation with the UN agencies – IOM and UNHCR in particular – and we have at the same time a sustainable and humane approach with our partners on the external side of migration.  If I have one regret, it is that Operation Sophia, which managed to have a successful beginning in countering traffickers, seizing their vessels, arresting traffickers, saving lives at sea and implementing the arms embargo on Libya. I only regret that our Member States at the Council decided to withdraw the naval assets from the Mediterranean. Having a naval operation without naval assets does not give too much credibility to our actions. So I really hope that there will be some developments in the coming weeks and months that could restore our presence at sea in the moment when this is most needed – both for the security situation in Libya, but also for having an effective fight against the trafficking networks across the Mediterranean. Last, but not least, some of you mentioned some criticisms, more preoccupations, worries, on the risk of having a militarisation of the European Union security and foreign policy. Let me say this very clearly: the European Union way to security is never, never, never an aggressive one. The European Union is, as some of you have said, the peace project that has been the most successful in history – at least in recent history. We’ve managed to overcome our own conflicts and crises and, on the basis of that experience, we are trying to help our partners, we are trying to accompany our partners, in their search for peace and democracy and human rights.  I see on a daily basis what the European Union military men and women, as well as police and civilian security forces, do in our missions and operations. What we do is support the democratic institutions of our partner countries to build institutions that deal with security and defence – be they the armies or the security forces on the civilian side – and accompany UN peacekeeping missions trying to establish peace and functioning institutions in the field of security and defence in very difficult circumstances.  I just last week visited our missions and operations in countries as difficult as Mali, Niger and the Central African Republic. Were it not for the European Union men and women in uniform, these countries would face probably much, much worse conditions on the ground in security terms.  So the work we do is never to kill – that is taken for granted. It is never to play an aggressive part in a conflict. On the contrary, some of you mentioned the strategic autonomy element we are trying to develop, which is intended to be able to autonomously play the role of peace builder that this world really needs.

The humanitarian situation is still dire, it is getting worse by the day. Seven million Venezuelans in the country are in need of assistance and 3.7 million people are malnourished, according to UNHCR and FAO respectively. Four million Venezuelans have already fled the country in the past four years, and future projections point to continued increases. The regional impact of the crisis is massive, including for the stability of the region. And on the political front, the government has arbitrarily arrested many members of the National Assembly and lifted their parliamentary immunity. The recent death of Captain Acosta Arévalo after he was taken into custody by the Venezuelan security forces is, for me – but I think for all of us – shocking. We have immediately called for a thorough and truly independent investigation that brings those responsible to justice. We have all seen the report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, that confirms what we already knew very well: that human rights violations in Venezuela are frequent and are serious. We fully support both the findings of the report and, most importantly, the recommendations. Just today, I issued a statement on behalf of all 28 Member States making clear that we stand ready to assist the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in her efforts to ensure that the fundamental rights of all Venezuelans are fully protected. In light of her report, we are also ready to start work towards applying targeted measures for those members of the security forces involved in torture and other serious violations of human rights. Addressing the humanitarian and social emergency in Venezuela is urgent and long overdue. In the last weeks, something has started to move on the diplomatic side. The talks that Norway is mediating resumed last week in Barbados, and new meetings are ongoing as we speak. We all know that the path towards a democratic transition is fraught with obstacles, yet for the first time in months, or even years, this can be a preliminary step in the right direction towards a peaceful and democratic transition, both peaceful and democratic, with free and credible presidential elections. In this, I am proud of the key role that the European Union has played in giving diplomacy a chance, when violence seemed to be the only game in town and a very risky one not only for Venezuela, but also for the region and for the rest of the world. We insisted that there was no military solution to the crisis and that any outcome had to be both peaceful and democratic. This is why we set up the international contact group at the beginning of this year, with the crucial participation of four Latin American countries, and just last week a fifth country from the region asked to join in. The contact group was never supposed to mediate talks. We knew that from the very beginning, also because mediation, especially a mediation as complex us this one, cannot be mediated by a group, and also because we knew very well that the conditions for starting mediation when we started the international contact group were not there at all. So the group was not created for mediating a process – we’ve always been very clear on this, including in this chamber – the goal of the contact group has always been to try and contribute to create the conditions for a meaningful mediation to be launched in a credible manner in the right framework. In a moment – I stress this – when an escalation seemed almost inevitable, today after months of good work, and I would like to thank my colleagues, both the foreign ministers of the Latin American countries, of the European countries that are part of the contact group, but also all our teams that have been working on this literally night and day, with a lot of dedication, after months of work today the space to build a peaceful and democratic solution to the crisis has opened up. In these months, the contact group’s role has been recognised by all parties inside the country, in the region, and in the international arena. I engaged personally with all our international interlocutors, from the United States to Russia and China, from the Vatican to Cuba, from the Lima Group, to Caricom. Representatives of the Contact Group met all Venezuelan actors during their visits to Caracas. My Special Adviser for Venezuela, Enrique Iglesias, was in Caracas just days ago, and he met all relevant actors at the highest level, starting with Juan Guaidó, Nicolás Maduro, the United Nations, the main political parties, but also civil society and the Catholic Church. This work has been essential to open the space for a political solution. It is not to be taken for granted at all that this space is going to be used to reach a political solution, but at least we have stopped the escalation on the military violence side, and we have given the political solution a chance. This is why we all agreed, at the contact group meeting in Costa Rica a few months ago, first of all to continue our work, but also to intensify our political engagement and our outreach to relevant international actors. So the process that has now started is extremely fragile, but this is exactly why we must now do everything we can to support and accompany the talks in Barbados. A peaceful and democratic transition has to come from within Venezuela. It can never be imposed from the outside, but we can, and must, facilitate this process with all means available, as we did in these months. And we must be crystal clear, there’s no doubt about that. The country needs new presidential elections with a free and fair electoral process, with a level playing field for all candidates. And Venezuela also needs an effective separation of powers, starting with the recognition and respect of the National Assembly’s prerogatives and of the immunity of all its members. Some essential elements for a credible process have emerged very clearly from our talks and our work in these months. First, that crucial state institutions such as the Supreme Court of Justice and ‘citizen power’ offices work for all citizens of Venezuela in an impartial way. In particular a revised and balanced composition of the National Electoral Council will be needed. Second, that all candidates are allowed to participate in the elections with the same rights and with no arbitrary restrictions. Third, that the voter register is updated, including young voters and Venezuelans abroad. And fourth, that international election observers monitor the whole electoral process and not just the election days. The European Union and the entire international contact group are ready to help throughout the electoral process if the parties ask for our support and if we get to that stage. This is probably the most delicate moment in the path that could lead towards a peaceful and democratic solution. This is the moment to do everything we can to strengthen this fragile process and help it deliver on the Venezuelan people’s aspirations. We continue to believe that a certain degree of pressure needs to be maintained. The Venezuelan regime needs to understand that the status quo is simply not an option. it is not sustainable; not for the country, not for its citizens, not for the region, and not for the world. Today with our statements with all the 28 Member States, we clearly recalled that, and I quote: ‘In case there are no concrete results from the ongoing negotiations, the European Union will further expand its targeted measures’. At the same time, we made clear once again, I quote again: ‘that these measures can be reversed in case substantial progress is made towards the restoration of democracy, rule of law and human rights in Venezuela.’. In the meantime, we will also continue to work through the contact group and in close cooperation with the UN to guarantee full access to humanitarian assistance without any restrictions, including by local humanitarian NGOs. We welcome the progress that has been made in this direction that we have accompanied and pushed for in these months, including with the appointment of a humanitarian coordinator by the UN. Since the beginning of the crisis we, the European Union, have been one of the largest humanitarian donors to the Venezuelan people inside the country, but also in the neighbouring countries in the region. We continue to support, at political and financial level, all regional and international initiatives to address the refugee crisis, starting with the Quito Process, and this will not change. As we work on the political path, we also need to be extremely active on humanitarian support. But beyond the humanitarian aid, we have, vice versa, the responsibility to keep accompanying the work towards a peaceful and democratic way out of the crisis.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 166, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Paulo RANGEL", "mepid": "96903", "text": "  on behalf of the Ppe Group. – Mr President, Madam High Representative, I consider it essential that, at the first moment of this parliamentary term, when opening the work of the European Parliament, he should take a clear and unequivocal position on the humanitarian crisis in Venezuela.

In the words of one great Austrian economist, Friedrich Hayek, it will lead down the road to serfdom.

This strikes me – this shocks me – and I think we can be proud if it was the European Union, through our work, with a contact group, with the countries in the region, with the United Nation agencies, to stop any thinking of a military escalation; to stop any thinking of a military escalation from outside the country and from inside the country. I’m proud we have been the ones working with the UN agencies, with the humanitarian agencies, to allow them to enter the country and deliver assistance to the population. I’m proud we have been, and we continue to be, probably the biggest donor for assistance to the Venezuelan population. I hope you keep that in mind, and I hope – I really hope (I will be sharing only a few months with this Parliament) – but I really hope that you will have these five years ahead of you without thinking that imagining a military intervention to invade a country is a good option. This scares me as a European, if I can say so. I think this should be very clear in everybody’s mind in Europe, because we have lived in Europe – what it means to be at war. And I think that the value of our work in the world is exactly our history: it is full of blood, and that has taught us that war is never a good idea. We will continue, and I think that there is large convergence in this Hemicycle – not full convergence; I didn’t expect that – on the need to continue to work in this direction. First of all, to insist for a peaceful solution excluding any military attempt. Second, to work for a democratic solution with early presidential elections, with all the guarantees that this can be, finally, free and fair, which has not been the case before. Thirdly, this includes dialogue, diplomatic engagement, full support that we have been providing from even before the talks mediated by Norway have started. We will continue to support the talks, knowing (without being naive) that in the past, previous experiences of negotiation and mediation have proven to be so difficult and also inconclusive, but a clear set up, clear perspective: I think we have a duty. The European Council also thinks we have a duty – I should move to the other part of the Hemicycle here to say that – to support this chance that a democratic peaceful transition can happen with political means, with diplomatic efforts. This includes also sanctions, and I want to stress this very clearly, because I hope that everyone in this Hemicycle knows at least what policies the European Union has and does not have in place. The European Union measures are not sanctions against the country or the population. The measures that we have in place are targeted against persons – single individuals – that are responsible for serious violations of human rights. I want this to be very clear. Last but not least, humanitarian support. I think we will need to continue to, first of all, provide resources. Last time I talked to Mark Lowcock, the UN Under-Secretary responsible for the humanitarian assistance. He was telling me that at this stage, the main problem when it comes to humanitarian assistance is indeed the lack of resources – much more than the difficulties of access. So I think that we have a responsibility as Europeans to keep and even increase the level of assistance to the population, to our brothers and sisters in Venezuela. We have so many ties – so many family ties, and some of them are sitting in this room – that we have an interest, a duty, to support the people of Venezuela, and there is no doubt about that. But we also have a duty, I think, and a responsibility to call for others to increase their humanitarian assistance because, while there is work to try and achieve an electoral process as soon as possible that is transparent and fair and credible, we cannot ignore the dramatic humanitarian needs of the population. And last but not least, to support the work of Michelle Bachelet, including with additional measures, if the Member States consider unanimously that this is the case: to support her work, again with individual targeted measures that we can introduce to follow up the recent reports on the human rights violations that are extremely serious. So I hope this Parliament will be, if not unanimously, largely behind this approach, because having a strong voice from the European Parliament, from the European institutions, will be crucial to having a key role, including with the countries in the region from Brazil to Colombia: all of them, from Mexico to the countries that are part of the international contact group, in making Europe part of an active solution that is – let me stress once again – peaceful and democratic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 195, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  In accordance with Rule 132(2) of the Rules of Procedure, six motions for resolutions have been tabled.

In this context, which has become untenable for the Venezuelan people, it is all the more necessary for the European Union to continue its action in support of a peaceful and negotiated solution to the crisis, which excludes the use of force or military intervention and which, through free elections in the presence of international observers, promotes the pacification of the country.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 197, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Urmas PAET", "mepid": "129073", "text": "  Writing. – The situation in Venezuela remains dire.

It is part of our region, and the security situation in the Gulf is closely connected with our own security. We’ve always said that preserving the nuclear deal with Iran is first and foremost for us a European and global security interest, and this has become self-evident today. We don’t want to see a military escalation in our region, nor do we want to see a nuclear arms race in a region that knows already so many tensions. Throughout the years we have always said that without the nuclear deal the situation in the Middle East, which is already complicated enough, would be even more difficult, much more difficult than it is now. We have always said that. Now there seems to be a growing consensus on this. Even those who were sceptical – even very sceptical – about the deal, today understand that the situation would be much worse without it. This is what I hear in all my conversations in particular with regional leaders in the Gulf, and the current tensions were very much in the minds of all the leaders, for instance of Iraq and Kuwait, whom I met during my trip to the region last Saturday and Sunday. Together we discussed how we can help avoid further escalation, including by supporting initiatives from the region itself to build a basic initial level of understanding and trust among the main actors. No one says that he wants a war. No one declares that a war is the intention. In the region nobody is saying so, beyond nobody is saying so, but the problem is that in particular in a region like that miscalculations can happen and can lead to extremely dangerous spirals of confrontation. This is why we Europeans are inviting all relevant actors to exercise maximum restraint and to think rationally. This is why we’ve been doing everything we can to save the nuclear deal ever since the United States’ unilateral withdrawal. Yesterday we had a discussion with the foreign ministers of the 28 at the Foreign Affairs Council. Let me tell you that all 28 Member States have confirmed our common intention to do all we can collectively to preserve the nuclear deal, even in these extremely difficult circumstances. We have an interest to do so, we feel the responsibility to do so. You all know the situation. It has probably never been as difficult as it is today. Fourteen months after the United States’ withdrawal from the deal, Iran has announced that it would gradually reduce its compliance with the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The International Atomic Energy Agency, which remains the point of reference to assess Iran’s compliance with its nuclear commitments under the deal, has confirmed, after having confirmed for many years Iran’s full compliance, that Iran has now increased its stockpile of low-enriched uranium and has enriched uranium beyond the limits set in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. These actions are inconsistent with the deal, and together with the Foreign Ministers from France, Germany and the UK, I issued two extremely clear statements urging Iran to go back to full compliance. Full compliance – I want to underline that – that Iran has kept ever since the deal was done until a few days ago. At this stage, Iran’s actions are still reversible and do not indicate an unequivocal decision or intention by Iran to revert to its nuclear programme. At the same time, I want to be very clear: the longer Iran proceeds down this road, the harder it will be, technically, to step back. Our request to Iran is very clear: go back to the full implementation of the deal as you have been doing so far. This is in our interest, this is in Iranians’ interest, this is our collective interest, and this is the same interest that was behind the decision to conclude the Iran nuclear deal. We did that because we knew that kind of deal was in the interest of all of us collectively and, I would say, in the interest of collective security in the world. On our side, as the European Union, with the Member States, we’ve stepped up our work to try to mitigate the consequences of the United States’ unilateral decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran. At the end of June, we convened in Vienna another meeting of the Joint Commission, that is the body overseeing implementation of the deal that we chair. Together with the E3 – France, Germany and the United Kingdom, China, Russia and Iran – we had a difficult but constructive meeting where we managed remain united concerning the continuous need and commitment for full and effective implementation of the agreement by all sides. In Vienna at this Joint Commission meeting, we also decided that our experts will convene soon to discuss implementation issues, including how to facilitate the export of low-enriched uranium and heavy water out of Iran, something that has become increasingly difficult after the re-imposition of US sanctions. On that very same day when we met in Vienna, France, Germany and the UK announced that the Instrument in Support of Trade Exchanges (INSTEX) with Iran was finally operational, something they had been working on for months, and the European Union and my offices in particular, have been accompanying and supporting this process. So now the instrument is finally operational and it is processing its first transactions. On the same day, seven EU Member States declared that they are willing to join the mechanism, and yesterday at the Foreign Affairs Council more Member States declared they are considering the possibility of joining INSTEX. We’re also having conversations with non-European Union countries that might join, because preserving the nuclear deal with Iran is not just a European interest. Many others around the world share our same preoccupation, first of all about an arms race in the region, in particular a nuclear arms race in the region. So preserving the deal is not only in our interest and our responsibility – it is – but it is also a joint responsibility for all around the world. I want to recall once again that the deal is not a bilateral or even a multilateral agreements only: it is a UN Security Council resolution unanimously adopted, so there is a global responsibility to preserve it, and to preserve its full implementation. On our side, as the European Union, as Europeans, we’re doing everything we can. We never thought that this would be easy – and indeed it is not easy at all – but what we are trying to achieve is so important, and somehow an unprecedented exercise. I am sure that if it weren’t for us, the deal first of all would not exist in the first place, and would probably not be alive as of today. We’ve always said that any violation of the nuclear deal with Iran could only make our region more unstable, more violent and more exposed to the risk of escalation in tensions. Recent events, I’m afraid, have proven us right. But our objective is not to be proven right. Our objective is to try and make things work for the better and to develop in a positive direction. I believe no one today should underestimate the risk that an escalation poses to all of us collectively in Europe, in the Middle East and all around the world. So it is in our collective interest to do everything we can to prevent this scenario. So our choice as Europeans – and I know we are united on this – is very clear: we will continue to do everything we can to save the deal. We will continue to be a voice of reason, and we will continue to do that for our own security, for peace in our troubled region, and because we know that especially if there is a problem, the ‘must’ is to keep the channels of communication and of cooperation open, and to invest in the diplomatic way of solving problems.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "PPE", "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 200, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – Mr President, High Representative, I thank you for your very detailed report on current developments.

Tehran's moves seem to be going in this direction, provocations, but nothing more. Mine is therefore an invitation to rationality which must continue to prevail. In these situations, an error of assessment can precipitate the situation. I believe that the Iranian regime is still willing to dialogue, which I am convinced remains the only option acceptable to the entire international community.

La question est de savoir si et quand il va être prêt, j’y fais référence dans mes remarques d'introduction. Non seulement le mécanisme est prêt mais il est déjà opérationnel. Il traite actuellement les premières transactions, depuis maintenant quelques semaines. Cela va prendre du temps parce qu’il faut prêter une attention très importante à la due diligence mais le mécanisme est en place, il travaille déjà sur les premières transactions qui en sont en cours de traitement. Anyway, I can repeat it in English so the interpreters will help me with the appropriate French technical language. INSTEX has been operational for a couple of weeks. It has started to proceed with the first transactions so it is already in place. The other part of the question, that I was surprised to receive, from another colleague from the same group, was whether we intend to activate, in respect of the extraterritorial impact of the US sanctions, the blocking status that we had in place to protect European investments, a few decades ago, vis-à-vis the extraterritorial impact of US sanctions on Cuba. The blocking status has already been reactivated, covering the extraterritorial effect of US sanctions on Iran in this case, for more than a year. I think that was done in the summer of last year, and I can provide you with all the information. It is all public. The previous Parliament debated this several times. The blocking status has been activated to cover European interests in Iran with regard to the extraterritorial effects of the US sanctions for a year now and, yes, INSTEX is already operational and processing the first transactions in these very same weeks. I hope that is clarifying and reassuring. Again, all this information is publicly available and I have mentioned this several times, not only in the past few weeks but also in the previous months. Having said that, some of you touched on other aspects that are not related either to the current escalation across the Gulf or to the preservation of the nuclear deal. In particular, I want to stress one point that is particularly important to me, namely our work to promote human rights across the region. In Iran and in other countries in the Gulf, this has constantly been part of our work, bilaterally and regionally. By the way, we also have measures in place concerning human rights. We have human rights dialogues and we have considerable engagement, in particular, with the protection of human rights activists and some other citizens as well. So we’re following both individual cases and human rights situations across the Gulf in a very active manner – as well as, as some of you mentioned, the recent risks to the freedom and safety of navigation in the Gulf. This is also a top priority for us and we are making that extremely clear. To answer two specific questions asked by one of the last speakers, we would not support regime change. We normally don’t support regime change anywhere in the world and it is not the kind of policy the EU promotes or supports. This is the case here too. We are respectful of the political dynamics inside countries. The angle from which we see the situation – not only in Iran, but also across the Gulf – is that of the promotion of channels of communication. This brings me to the first part of the Honourable Member’s question, which was about what we can do, or what we are doing, to promote channels of cooperation, or communication at least, in particular between Iran and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia but also more generally across the region. We have been working very actively in recent years, inter alia, to try and help our friends in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to overcome their own divergences and splits. What we’re doing in specific terms is, on the one hand, keeping our own channels of cooperation open with all sides. Secondly, we’re trying to support those forces in the region – one of which is Kuwait – that are trying to build bridges, trying to open channels for communication and trying, in particular in the case of the GCC countries, to underline the fact that there is a win—win scenario: regional cooperation is beneficial for all. In this respect, I announced during my visit to Baghdad on Saturday that the European Union would be more than ready to support in all possible ways the initiative that the President of Iraq is considering, of convening a regional conference of the neighbours of Iraq. The aim would be to try to identify a common objective that unites all the neighbours of Iraq, which is protecting the country itself from this escalation in the region and also preserving the achievements that Iraq has managed to build, including with the support of the international community, in terms, for instance of the territorial defeat of Daesh and the improvement of the situation in the country. We are supporting all possible initiatives from within the region and, obviously, from an international perspective, to highlight that there is a common interest – a shared interest – across the region. The European experience is clear in this respect. You can disagree, you can have a past of being enemies, or even at war, and you can still not define one another as friends, but if you share the same geographical space – and geography is something you cannot change – you have an interest in identifying the framework within which your disagreements can be handled in a peaceful and contained manner. That is the indication we are giving. In Europe we have experience of how to handle disagreements within a certain regional framework that may even be tense. We can offer our support and our experience in how to build a security framework architecture that is increasingly important as tensions arise. I hope this answers your questions and I hope we can continue to count on your support because what is important is not only the practical steps we can take but also the political messages that we can send to the region. I believe that the voice of this Parliament will be important in that respect.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 216, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  The debate is closed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 217, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  The next item on the agenda is the debate on the statement by the Vice-President of the Commission and High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on the situation in Moldova (2019/2737 (RSP).\"", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 218, "date": "2019-07-16.json", "name": "David McALLISTER", "mepid": "124806", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. – Mr President, throughout the past legislature we held many debates on Moldova, and not a single one was positive.

But I can fully share what David McAllister was saying in the very first sentences.  We’ve had many debates about Moldova in this Hemicycle in the past years and they have very few times, if ever, been encouraging or positive.  The people of Moldova have asked for change, for reforms that would bring the country forward. Recently this was very evident. The European Union has followed the situation in recent months, as well as in the previous years, step-by-step, as neighbours, as partners and, most of all, as friends of the Moldovan people. We are glad that Moldova now has a government with a bold programme to tackle corruption and reform the country. Obviously, after the programmes, reforms need to happen for real and implementation has to come. I want to recall where we stood just one year ago. When I met the previous Parliament for an urgency debate on Moldova, the situation was critical. The mayoral elections in the capital, Chișinău, had just been annulled by dubious court decisions. It was a difficult moment for our relations with Moldova. We had to take unpleasant but necessary decisions, for instance when we put on hold our micro-financial assistance because Moldova was not sticking to its own commitments. In June, after the elections, a short but very profound institutional crisis unfolded. Together with Commissioner Hahn, we made clear our position: that we expected the democratically legitimate government to be allowed to take office and the rule of law to be respected. We were all relieved that the new government could finally start its work, and the institutional crisis was solved in a clear and peaceful manner.  The new government’s programme has, at its core, many of the priorities that are clearly spelled out in our Association Agreement with Moldova. It is good to see that their agenda talks not only about structural reforms to fight corruption more effectively, but also about the independence of the judiciary and improving the electoral framework. These are not demands that come from the European Union. These are demands that come from the people of Moldova, which the European Union is ready to support.  I am also glad that, in these very first weeks, our contacts with our new counterparts have been very intense and very positive. Commissioner Hahn visited Chișinău in June. Prime Minister Sandu was in Brussels at the beginning of July. Just yesterday in Brussels, we hosted a new Foreign Minister, Nicolae Popescu, at our Foreign Affairs Council for a discussion on how to more forward in our Association Agreement implementation.  As you know, we are preparing a set of concrete measures to support the country based on the implementation of reforms under the Association Agreement and the package. What we are working on also includes the release of assistance that had been put on hold.  Yesterday, we also confirmed that the next Association Council with Moldova can take place next autumn. Their Foreign Minister yesterday confirmed that the new government intends to tackle corruption decisively and to address the politicisation of state institutions, including the judicial system. He also confirmed to us that Moldova has a strong interest in its partnership with the European Union, both politically and economically. Our partnership has nothing to do with geopolitics or spheres of influence. Recent events have demonstrated very clearly that for the people of Moldova what truly matters is reforms and positive change, and not really geopolitics or calculations.  I also want to make it very clear that we see all the good intentions and all the good arguments, but what will really count is the implementation of these intentions and the real capacity to put in place changes in the country. In this spirit, what we want to do is to keep accompanying and supporting reforms in Moldova. We do not do politics. We do not do internal politics in countries. We relate with institutions on the basis of content and policies, programmes and concrete reforms put in place. This moment represents an opportunity for the country, and we will be there to accompany this opportunity so that it can succeed.

This is a huge victory for all the Moldovans who voted for change. Now the new Prime Minister, Ms Maia Sandu, has to tackle a number of challenges. Federica Mogherini just mentioned a number of them: the fight against corruption, the reform of the judiciary, the depoliticisation of the state administration, the electoral reform and a pluralistic media landscape with adequate financing and safeguards to protect journalists.  A sustainable reform agenda for Moldova should be accompanied by a determined effort to heal the deep social divisions that we have seen in recent months, including a genuine commitment to inter-party dialogue in the Parliament in Chișinău.
