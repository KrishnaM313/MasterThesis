(Projection of a video) It is my pleasure to welcome to this House the cellist Mischa Maysky, who will play an opening piece accompanied by her son Max on the piano. The song is \"From Jewish Life: Prayer\" by Ernest Bloch. (Musical interlude) Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs Liliana Segre, Madam President of the Commission, Commissioners, kind guests, diplomatic representations, representatives of national parliaments, mayors of martyred cities, we are here today to remember that 75 years ago the gates of one of the places that the memory of Europeans will never forget opened. The Soviet army had arrived at Auschwitz-Birkenau and the gates opened up on a factory of death which, with maniacal punctuality and systematic extermination, caused more than one and a half million deaths in that camp, causing unspeakable suffering and pain. Opening those gates, like all the other gates that gradually opened in all nazi death camps, is meaningful for future generations, for us, to find out where the man who loses his humanity can go. But not only that: he showed what it means to build an enemy to prove that he can annihilate him; what hatred can produce in the service of an uncontrolled will to power; how far sadism can pollute our societies; where it can bring instinct, freed from consciousness, in enhancing the satisfaction of feeling like owners of life. At Auschwitz, a European land, the gates of the abyss were opened that day in 1945. Because in that place it was not enough to destroy people's bodies, reducing them to smoke and ashes to erase all their past, present and future traces, but it was necessary first of all to annihilate their souls, deprive them of their identity, turn them into a number to be branded on the body, use them, as President Simone Veil recalled, as \"Stück\", that is, \"pieces\" of raw material. At Auschwitz it is the very essence of humanity that has been called into question by the desire to exterminate the Jewish people, and with it the Roma and Sinti people, the opponents, and enslave the Slavic peoples, the homosexuals. Auschwitz is unspeakable. Vasily Grossman, recounting the experience of the Treblinka concentration camp, wrote: \"In his hell Dante did not see them, scenes like these\". But if hell is reserved for sinners, what sin could be attributed to children, women, all those who passed through the chimney or were tortured, offended, humiliated, reduced to spare parts? Auschwitz embodied the very negation of our civilisation. The civilization which has Jewish and Christian origins, which has met the Islamic world, which has conquered the Enlightenment and built its coexistence on the law, which has fought against barbarism and the defence of human dignity, which has sought to offer an idea of the beauty of the person and of the people who live together in our cities and countries. A civilization that has stopped its race towards the desire for freedom on the threshold of the gate of Auschwitz. Faced with this, today, full of emotion and gathered in recollection, we bow before all the victims of the Holocaust and want to assume our duty to remember. We take on this duty because we know that Auschwitz was built by Europeans and we are called upon to assume this paternity because what has happened falls on us and calls us to account. What happened is the son of our history. Because the Nazis came out of the womb of good mothers, from cosmopolitan families, from families singing Te Deum, from fathers who educated in the free spirit. Children who have not been able to react and oppose and define their responsibility. The final solution has caused the unimaginable to enter the imagination and shows that what can be imagined, aided by circumstances, can be brought to incarnate. Auschwitz, with all the factories of death scattered throughout Europe, to the north and south, to the east, is a fundamental issue in our society, our civilisation, our culture and imposes obligations on us. First of all, it imposes an obligation on us to act whenever there is an act of violence and discrimination, whenever anti-Semitic and racist action occurs in our societies. We must always regard this as an attack on people's dignity and an attack on our idea of Europe. So let us repeat it together today, because otherwise there would be no point in remembering the liberation of the Auschwitz-Birkenau camp: Nazism and racism are not opinions, but crimes! (Ovation) Every once we read in the newspaper reports of violence, sacrilege and insults, we must consider those violence, those sacrilege and those insults addressed to each of us. These are attacks on Europe and on the values it represents and which embody the two diseases of the modern nation, which are spreading on our continent: on the one hand, the sanctisation of borders and, on the other, the search for a pure and unique identity – religious, ethnic and cultural – which inevitably leads to the construction of enemies. Europe, on the contrary, has been formed and we want to continue to be formed with our diversity, with our pluralities, with political, religious and cultural pluralism. And it is precisely for this reason that we must be grateful to Judaism that has enabled us to form that universalist spirit that is an integral part of our worldview. In the Europe that has experienced absolute evil, we have managed to build an area of brotherhood, friendship and democracy that we do not want to be violated. That is why we call on governments to use vigilance and severity in the face of all forms of intolerance. There is no crime about the vandalism in Jewish cemeteries, the assaults on synagogues and places of worship, the threats to Which European Jewish families are subjected or the forms of intolerance that affect minorities in our Member States. They're not girls! All this is very clearly stated in our Treaties and we call on the Commission and the Council to ensure that this is enforced. We have a responsibility in the face of these dangers. It happened once and it can happen again. We must feel the commitment to a clear historical conscience and always bear true witness to the events that have taken place to prevent denials and amnesia, perhaps dictated by vulgar opportunism. But our conscience must also be vigilant, that is, capable of understanding, to prevent and intervene whenever the seeds of absolute evil spread. Indeed, the Holocaust would not have been possible without the complicity and cowardice that existed in Europe at the time. In the face of this it is necessary to \"think of oneself as another\", as the philosopher Paul Ricœur said. The other is the skeletal man from Auschwitz, the walking man of Alberto Giacometti, a man who is heading for a future he hopes for better. But the other is also the foreigner who wishes to write the history of Europe with us. The Righteous, like Jan Karski and many others, who risked their lives and saved innocent people from the abyss, must every day be a source of inspiration for our actions, for we always have the choice and the absolute duty not to accept indifference in the face of the dangers of anti-Semitism, racism and the rejection of the other. Ultimately, we must accept the injunction of the Bible that we find, expressed explicitly but very simply, in the Book of Leviticus, and whose fundamental ethical scope we recognize, regardless of whether we are believers or not: \"Not ... you will cooperate in the death of your neighbour.\" This must guide our actions and invites us to keep our memories of what happened at Auschwitz and to take responsibility for transmitting the memory. This task, as the inexorable turn of time makes witnesses fail, is entrusted to ours and future generations. Paul Celan wrote in one of his poems: \"No one / testifies for the / witness\" referring to the almost sacred character of what a witness represents. We are all here today to express our gratitude to Senator Liliana Segre who is here with us today to give us her testimony. When Gilles Deleuze claimed to write \"for the illiterate\", he did not mean that he wrote \"for the illiterate to read\", but that he wrote \"instead of the illiterate\", of which he was spokesman and witness. Similarly, at Auschwitz and today in this House where European democracy is expressed, we are testifying for those deaths, assuming the duty of transmission that their sacrifice has implicitly assigned us. Auschwitz is unspeakable. However, I would like to believe that the testimony of those who have seen the unspeakable will be able to move our hearts and inspire the ethics of our actions, so that this never happens again. Let us therefore listen to the voice of Mrs Segre, to whom I give the floor. With her we will be stronger in supporting our testimony against indifference. It is a great honour, Madam, that you are here with us today and it is a great gift that you have managed to survive Auschwitz and to allow us to know so as not to forget.

I must begin by thanking my friend Sassoli, who invited me and parliament as a whole. I would also like to greet the British Members who are leaving us, much to everyone's chagrin.  I make no secret of the deep emotion of entering this European Parliament after seeing at the entrance the flags, the colourful flags of so many member states in the European Parliament, where we talk, debate and look each other in the eye.  That wasn't always the case. The day of 27 January is a day that is sometimes repeated too much, giving 27 January a lot of importance. After all, it is not that Auschwitz was liberated that day. The Red Army has entered, and the description that Primo Levi makes in the book \"The Truce\" of these four Russian soldiers who open and are in front of them – without releasing anything because the Nazis had already escaped for so many days – this incredible spectacle, at the moment in their eyes, but which later, much later, became an incredible sight for those who wanted to watch it. Someone doesn't want to watch it now, they say it's not true.  These extraordinary words of Primo Levi express the amazement at the evil of others, because this amazement at the evil of others no one who was imprisoned at Auschwitz could ever forget a second of his life. The amazement because other people who are not crazy, who do not come from a distant world but are your European brothers, have thought for you.  On 27 January I was thirteen years old and I was a slave worker in the Union munitions factory, a factory that still exists, where we used to make shell casings for machine guns. Suddenly, in the factory, after we had heard distant explosions – we worked in the city of Auschwitz and knew the things that were happening in Birkenau where I had been until very recently – came the immediate command from the factory itself to begin what was called the \"march of death\".  I was not liberated on January 27 by the Red Army. I was part of that group of more than 50 000 prisoners who were still alive and who had been forced into those physical conditions, not to mention what psychic ones were, starting that march, which lasted months and about which very little is said, the \"march of death\". When I speak in grandma's schools, as I have been talking about as a grandmother for thirty years, I say that everyone must, one leg in front of the other, in life, never lean on anyone, because in the death march we could not lean on the neighboring companion who dragged himself on the snow with his feet sore like us and who was finished by the guards of the escort if he fell , he was killed, no one could stay there on those roads. We crossed. How do you do that? How do you do that? Because the strength of life is extraordinary: this is what must be transmitted to today's young people who are mortified by the lack of work, mortified by the vices they receive from their soft parents, so everything is allowed, while life is not, life then prepares you for this march that must become \"march for life\".  We didn't want to die. We were madly attached to life, whatever it was, so, one leg in front of the other, throw ourselves on the manure, eat any crap, whatever, eat the snow where it wasn't soiled with blood and don't ask us anything more than to move forward, walk, walk.  It was the evil of others. The windows were closed. We crossed, at first it was Poland and Upper Silesia, then it was Germany. And months and months later, after spending more Lagers, other horrors, other evils, we arrived at Ravensbruck, a Jugendlager named Jugendlager because we were actually young, but we looked old, sexless, ageless, breastless, without menstruation, without underwear. One should not be afraid of these words, because that is how you take away a woman's dignity. Is that so.  (Loud applause)  You're used to surviving now because there was something inside of us that said to us: forward, forward, forward, forward, forward. Day after day, camp after camp, I found myself at the end of April 1945 – think in that situation how far away january 27 was – in that physical state, with companions lost in that march, left there without being able to get up, never rescued by anyone, because no one opened a window, threw a piece of bread.  There was fear. It was fear that made the choice be very few. Because we hardly ever talk about these overtime who made the choice, it is taken for granted that entire peoples were guilty because it was not only the German people, it was the whole of Europe occupied by the Nazis. We are talking about France, we are talking about Italy, I do not know much about other states, where our neighbours were extraordinary aids for the Nazis. I speak of Italy, where we have unfortunately seen our neighbors who denounced us, who took possession of our apartment, our office and also the dog sometimes because it was a purebred dog. The dog was purebred. This word 'race', which we still hear, and that is why we must combat this racism, this structural racism that still exist. People ask me: why are we still talking about anti-Semitism? It's okay that I'm very old in my 90s, but I'm not the one who knows why there's still anti-Semitism, because there's still racism. I reply that there has always been but that there was no political time to be able to bring out the anti-Semitism and racism that are inherent in the soul of the spirit poor. Yes, it is. And then come the historical moments, courses and appeals. The most suitable moments come, the moments come when you turn the other way, when it is easier again to pretend nothing, it is easier to look at your own courtyard, to say that it is something that I do not care, because I must care, it does not concern me. And then all those who take advantage of this situation find the right ground to come forward.  Now, the war did not stop, as we know, and before it was liberated by the Allies in northern Germany, it arrived on May 1, 1945. The situation of the Jews was similar in the occupied countries, allied with the Nazis, it was similar in fact if not by law. The Jews of that time had been and had deeply felt German, Italian, French and Hungarian citizens and patriots, they had fought in wars. I remember my father and uncle who had been officers in The First World War and how many German Jews cried and committed suicide because they felt German more than anything else. This expulsion from national communities was very painful, it was something that went far beyond the law, because it was precisely your neighbor. I was a little girl who became invisible and this happened to me even immediately after the war, when I happened to stay alive and returned to my Milan with the rubble still smoking and I met my schoolmates who had not seen me again, because in 1938 I was supposed to do the third grade and I was obviously a very serious danger both to fascists and to the Nazis for whom they decided that the Jewish children of that little one communities of Italian Jews – thirty-eight thousand or forty thousand people, then a small community, which was the victim of at least a third of the Holocaust – were turned away from schools. I was a little girl who was absolutely introduced into society and didn't feel any different and these companions, meeting after three or four years, said to me, \"But where did you end up that I never saw you at school again?\" I was a wounded girl, I was a wild girl, a girl who could no longer eat with a fork and knife because I was still used to \"fressen nicht essen\" which meant how the beasts that eat –\"fressen\" not \"essen\" – and as such I was bulimic, and as such I was also disgusting, and as such I was criticized even by those who loved me and wanted the bourgeois girl with good family education again.  It's hard to remember these things. I have to say that for thirty years I have been speaking in schools and I now feel it is a very strong psychic difficulty to continue, even if my duty is this and it would be this until death, since I have seen those colors, I have heard those smells, I have heard those screams, I have met people in that babel of languages, which today I can only remember here where so many languages meet in peace , because it was possible to communicate with our companions from all over Nazi-occupied Europe only by finding common words, because otherwise the absolute solitude of silence, that they could not exchange a word with the other, stemmed from some ancestral isolation of communities that had not met in parliaments, given that Europe had been arguing appallingly for centuries. Anyone who has studied history knows that it is now, for 75 years, an absolutely incredible period, whereas all the past has meant that people sometimes do not know each other. The flags outside, which I remembered at the beginning, made me remember that desire to find a common word with the Dutch, with the French, with the Polish, with the Germans, with the Hungarians. For example, I learned only one word from Hungarian, which was 'bread', which in Hungarian is called kenyér. And it's the main word, which means hunger, but it also means sacredness of something that's wasted today without even looking at what's thrown away.  So I've at least felt for three years that the memories of that little girl I've been, whereas today I'm ninety years old, don't give me peace. They do not give me peace because since I became grandmother I, thirty-two years ago, of one of my three grandchildren - Fortunately, I have three, as well as three wonderful children, and the European Parliament and my non-extinction seem to me at the moment to be the same miracle, I do not know if I am wrong, unfortunately, immod honestly – that little girl there who made the march of death, the one there who burned in her man's heart, the one there who was no longer crying, the one there who was looking for the common word , that's another one from me, and I'm my grandmother. I am a grandmother and when I address my grandchildren who have a displeasure of love or study or failure to achieve something that they would like to achieve I am a loving grandmother, I am a very present grandmother, I am a grandmother grateful for being also a grandmother, an exceptional miracle for one who was supposed to die. I'm my grandmother, too.  And it's a feeling that sometimes doesn't abandon me when I'm done talking in schools. Sometimes I talk to thousands of kids, all together two or three thousand, and so it's my duty to talk and I can only talk about myself and my companions, but I'm the one who jumps out, that skinny, skeletal, desperate, lonely little girl. And I can no longer bear it, because I am the grandmother of myself and I feel that if I do not stop talking and if I do not withdraw, that time that I have left to remember alone or to enjoy the great joys of my rediscovered family, I will not be able to do it again anyway because I will not make it anymore. So even today I find it difficult to remember, but it seemed to me a great duty to accept this invitation and have this opportunity to remember the evil of others, but also to remember that you can, one leg in front of the other, be like that little girl from Terezín – those who go to Prague or have already been there can visit the children's museum that in Terezín could do the plays or color with crayons and who then one day were all deported and killed to Auschwitz for The fault of being born, because they were children and therefore they could not have hurt anyone – that little girl, whose name I do not remember, who drew a yellow butterfly flying over barbed wire. I didn't have colored pencils and maybe I didn't and never had the wonderful fantasy of terezín's little girl. That the yellow butterfly always flies over barbed wire. This is a very simple message from grandma that I would like to leave to my ideal future grandchildren: that they are able to make the choice and with their responsibility and their conscience to always be that yellow butterfly that flies over barbed wire.

Of course, it is very difficult to take the floor after you, Liliana Segre. The power and the humanity of your speech, dear Liliana, was profoundly moving, and your memories. And I deeply admire, like all of us here in the room, your endless fight for remembrance. It is an important reminder for all of us of life and, as you’ve said, of its dignity. You often say that, and I quote: ‘understanding is impossible but knowledge is necessary’. And how could we ever understand this completely dehumanised world, this world beyond time, life and reality? These words come from another Auschwitz survivor, Ms Simone Veil – we’ve seen her in the video. The first President of the first directly-elected European Parliament, Simone Veil was a woman who, with heart and conviction, lived through Europe’s worst days and also its greatest moments of hope and of unity. Looking at Auschwitz Birkenau and what happened there, she coined the term of ‘the absolute evil’. Die systematische Ausrottung von sechs Millionen Juden ist das absolut Böse – das absolut Böse, das sich nicht in Worte fassen lässt, die schlimmste Barbarei, die der Mensch dem Menschen zufügen kann, das Verbrechen von Nazideutschland gegen die Menschheit. Und als Deutsche fühle ich schwere Schuld. Und doch spreche ich hier. Die Opfer, vor denen wir uns verneigen, wurden im Namen meiner Nation umgebracht. Die Stätten dieses Mordes wurden über ganz Europa verteilt: Auschwitz, Buchenwald, Babij Jar, Mauthausen, Bergen-Belsen, Treblinka – Namen unvorstellbarer Menschlichkeitsverbrechen und des Verlustes aller Humanität. Wir gedenken heute der Gequälten und Entrechteten der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltherrschaft. Wir gedenken Millionen ermordeter europäischer Juden, der Roma, der Sinti, der Zwangsarbeiterinnen und Zwangsarbeiter, der Zeugen Jehovas, der Homosexuellen, der Kranken und Behinderten, der politischen Gefangenen und der Kriegsgefangenen und vieler vieler anderer mehr. Wir verneigen uns vor den Toten. Ja, als Deutsche fühle ich die besondere Schuld, aber ich fühle auch die besondere Verantwortung. Denn als Deutsche in Europa weiß ich auch, dass es unsere Nachbarn waren, die uns die Hand gereicht haben und uns wieder aufgenommen haben in den Kreis der demokratischen Völker. Je sais, en tant qu’Européenne, que notre Union s’est bâtie en s’appuyant sur la volonté absolue de protéger la dignité de chaque être humain, car elle est inviolable; que nous avons la responsabilité permanente de combattre avec détermination toute forme d’antisémitisme et de discrimination, et de ne jamais, jamais oublier.  Le souvenir est douloureux et effrayant, mais il ne nous paralyse pas. Au contraire, il aiguise notre boussole morale et nous met en garde, parce que la Shoah n’a pas commencé à Auschwitz, mais bien plus tôt, dans les esprits des gens. Elle a commencé avec l’affaiblissement de la capacité de s’indigner face au dénigrement dont d’autres étaient victimes. Elle a commencé avec la brutalité et les discours de haine à l’égard des Juifs. Aux paroles ont succédé les actes, dont les crimes contre l’humanité constituent la concrétisation indicible. On a d’abord vu mourir l’empathie et déferler les invectives, sans que personne n’y mette fin.  The former United Nations Secretary, General Kofi Annan, once said: ‘all that evil needs to triumph is the silence of the majority’. This fight for remembrance, which you are leading with so much courage and determination, dear Liliana Segre, must be our common fight. It is a duty to remember for all of us and must be passed down from generation to generation. For when the memory fades, where today there are attempts to deny the Holocaust, where people are vilified and treated with contempt because they are Jews or because they are not like the majority, this is where Europe is called into question. For Europe rose with a firm will never again to give any quarter to absolute evil. Europe knows, like no other continent, that this mission means: do not let it take root – never, ever again. I thank you from the bottom of my heart, dear Liliana, for your tireless dedication to stop us forgetting, and I thank you for the courage with which you counter the hatred which has been rekindled in Europe and which you experienced first-hand. Your courage gives us strength. And we wish to say to you that Europe will not remain silent when Jews in Europe are again subjected to hatred and harassment. We will fight anti-Semitism at all levels. We will never allow the Holocaust to be denied. We will fight with all our strength against discrimination, racism and exclusion, and we want to see – and we will fight for – a normal life for Jews in Europe. You can rely on us. (Applause from the House) Der fünfundsiebzigste Jahrestag der Befreiung des Lagers Auschwitz ist Gedenken. Wir gedenken all derer, deren Zukunft ausgelöscht wurde. Wir gedenken all derer, die nie aus den Lagern zurückgekehrt sind. Anderthalb Millionen jüdische Kinder wurden ermordet. Ich weine um jedes Kind, und es hat seinen Namen in Yad Vashem. Wir gedenken aber auch derer, die überlebt haben und, liebe Liliana Segre, denen die schrecklichen Erinnerungen an diese Hölle auf ewig ins Gedächtnis eingebrannt sind. Aber dieses Gedenken ist auch ein Aufruf zur Wachsamkeit. Heinz Galinski, der langjährige Vorsitzende des Zentralrats der Juden in Deutschland, hat zu Recht gesagt: „Demokratie kann man keiner Gesellschaft aufzwingen, sie ist auch kein Geschenk, das man ein für allemal in Besitz nehmen kann. Sie muss täglich erkämpft und verteidigt werden.“ Genau darum geht es: Wehret den Anfängen! Seid wachsam! Seien wir aufrichtig gegenüber unserer Geschichte! Verteidigen wir die Unantastbarkeit der Würde eines jeden einzelnen Menschen! Verteidigen wir das Innerste und die Werte unserer Demokratie!

Lula was released as a result; Greenwald is now under attack for that same story. Colleagues, this is a transparent retaliation for holding power to account.

He has kept the unity of the 27, he has kept the unity between the three institutions, and everybody who works in Europe knows that this is not a small achievement. And for that reason, I want – especially for his friendship, for his cooperation – to thank Michel Barnier, our chief negotiator. (Applause) At the beginning of this debate, Mr President, I want also to pay tribute to our British colleagues – well, at least the overwhelming majority of them.  I have to say to them that they have always brought wit, charm, intelligence (some of them). And, let’s recognise, sometimes also stubbornness in this House. I think that I can say, in the name of all of us, from all Groups, I can only say we will miss you in the coming time and in the coming years. (Applause) Mr President, let me be clear from the start of this debate. Today’s vote is not a vote in favour of or against Brexit; it’s a vote for an orderly Brexit against a wild, a hard Brexit. I will be very honest with you: if we could stop Brexit by voting ‘no’ today, I would be the first to recommend it. But that’s not on our plate today. That’s not on our table and not the issue today. It is indeed a sad issue: sad to see a nation leaving, a great nation that has given all of us so much. I mean culturally, I mean economically, I mean politically, even its own blood in two world wars. It’s in fact sad to see a country leaving that twice liberated us, has twice given its blood to liberate Europe. And I think, Mr President, in these debates we cannot escape a key question: how could this happen? How is it possible that, more than 40 years after, I think, an enormous overwhelming majority of nearly 70% voted to enter into the European family, how 40 years later they decided, based on their sovereign rights, to leave this European project? I have to tell you that, since the outcome of the referendum (and that is now more than 3 years ago), I have heard many opinions about it. Everybody has an opinion about it. Some people are saying: well look, they are simply afraid, the Brits, of losing their sovereignty. That’s the issue. But colleagues, what does ‘sovereignty’ in fact mean today, in a world that is completely dominated by powerhouses like China, like India, like the US; in a world where we have to challenge transnational problems like climate change and the digital supremacy – tomorrow, of China, today of the US? Let me say it maybe a little more punchily: what is in fact threatening Britain’s   sovereignty most – the rules of our single market or the fact that tomorrow there will be, maybe, the planting of Chinese 5G masts in the British Isles? The cruel reality that we have to consider today in this debate is that European countries lost their sovereignty already a long time ago, and that Europe is just the way to regain that sovereignty in the coming years. There have been other people who told me and Michel Barnier: look, you don’t understand it. It’s all about migration that Brexit is happening: migrants working in British hospitals, migrants working in British universities, migrants working on construction sites in London. While in fact, dear colleagues, these migrants are European citizens exactly like British citizens are: paying taxes to Britain and, in fact, contributing to the future of British society. Then, finally, there are other opinions, but I will be short today (for once). There are others who are saying, and pointing the finger at us, and saying: yes, the reason for Brexit is simple. You didn’t give enough to Mr Cameron when he came to Brussels and when he requested new exceptions for Britain: exceptions on free movement, exceptions on the question of the political union. Well I have to tell you, Mr President and colleagues today, that, as rapporteur, it’s my personal opinion and my firm conviction that the opposite is true. Brexit started not three and a half years ago. Brexit started long ago, and I think, personally, that Brexit started exactly the day we started giving exceptions: with opt-ins, with opt-outs, with rebates. That’s, in my opinion, the moment the Union ceased to be in union. And it’s also the moment, colleagues, that the discontent about Europe started. All these exceptions, all these vetoes make a union, in my opinion, not capable to act effectively: always acting too little, too late. And it is, in my opinion, this lack of effectiveness that leads to even more discontent. It’s like a self-fulfilling prophecy, with members – one leg in the Union and another leg outside the Union – only looking for the advantages, not for the obligations. So in my opinion: yes, Brexit is also a failure of the Union. It’s also our failure: we have to recognise that in this debate. And yes, there is a lesson to learn from it, and this lesson, dear colleagues, is not to undo the union, as some are arguing here; no, this lesson is – and we have to learn this from Brexit – to deeply reform the union, to make it a real union in the coming years. That means a union without opt-ins, opt-outs, rebates, exceptions and, above all, without unanimity rules and veto rights. Only then can we act, and only then will we defend our interests, and only then will we defend our values. It is this lack of effectiveness that is the problem that we have seen in Brexit. I have to tell you – and that will be my conclusion, Mr President – in the last couple of days, I received – maybe as you – hundreds of mails from British citizens saying they desperately want either to stay or to return. And I have to tell you, for once – normally it’s easy for me – but this time I don’t know what to respond, because it’s not in our capacity to decide that. But that doesn’t mean that we don’t have a responsibility to make sure that the Union to which they will return will be another Union, effective and more democratic. So – and that’s my last sentence as rapporteur, Mr President (thank you for the support): this vote is not an adieu; this vote is, in my opinion, only an au revoir.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 28, "date": "2020-01-29.json", "name": "Nikolina Brnjac", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. – Mr President, when the honourable Members next meet in this Chamber after this weekend, this will be a different plenary. This will be a different union, with one member less. This is not the choice of the Council, nor the Parliament, but we have to respect it. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom will open a period of transition: a rather short one, if the United Kingdom’s intention remains not to seek its extension before 1 July. Our priority should, therefore, be to rapidly adopt a comprehensive negotiation mandate and start negotiations in order to build a new relationship with the United Kingdom that is as close as possible but balanced in terms of rights and obligations. The short duration of the transition period will, unfortunately, make it more difficult to achieve the widest—ranging outcome by the end of the year. We, therefore, have to remain prepared for all possible scenarios. It also seems that the current orientations of the United Kingdom Government are adding to this complexity, be it as regards the end of free movement, non—participation in the Single Market or the Customs Union, or the intention to diverge from a regulatory perspective. We have to invest all efforts to avoid the risk of a cliff edge, and to ensure a meaningful outcome of the negotiation this autumn. Fortunately, and regardless of the outcome, the Withdrawal Agreement will continue to apply, especially its Part 2 on citizens’ rights and the various remedies foreseen should the UK not deliver adequately in implementing these provisions. As we debated two weeks ago, having the Withdrawal Agreement in force does not mean that we should rest on our laurels. As noted in your resolution adopted on the occasion, a number of concerns regarding the preservation of citizens’ rights have to be addressed. This will call for careful monitoring by the UK side as well as by the Commission of the implementing of the relevant provisions. Today, your vote will hopefully pave the way for the next stage: negotiating the terms of the future relationship with the UK. A relationship for which the European Council called for a comprehensive mandate, covering trade and economic relations, as well as external and internal security. Likewise, this relationship should be underpinned by strong governance and robust level playing field provisions, given the close economic proximity of the United Kingdom. Even if the core elements of the future relationship – notably the horizontal provisions on governance and the level playing field – can be agreed by the end of the year, the negotiations are expected to take longer: until all the matters covered by the Political Declaration have been addressed. I therefore welcome the step taken by the Parliament to prepare itself within the adaptation of the Brexit Steering Group in a manner that will allow a closer follow—up of the negotiation process. Parliament’s resolution as well as its engagement, notably on citizens’ rights, have proved extremely useful during the negotiation process. We count on this engagement to continue during the transition period and later on – and indeed, a large degree of convergence was revealed during the Brexit process between the position of Parliament as developed in your various resolutions and the priorities of the Council.  Whatever happens, good cooperation between all EU institutions must continue. The European Parliament will remain fully informed and involved in accordance with the EU treaties. I do hope that, during the negotiations to come, our common efforts and commonality of purpose will provide the support required by our negotiator and help to achieve an outcome to the benefit of the Union and its citizens. To conclude, as I said at the beginning of my intervention, this is a special moment. A number of your colleagues, Members of this House, will be leaving. I know it is an emotional occasion for many of you and I would like to associate myself by addressing my gratitude to the UK Members of the European Parliament for their significant contribution to the work of your institution and of the European Union over the years and wish them well for the future.

I think of all those who helped to build our institutions: people like Commissioner Arthur Cockfield, who was known as the father of our single market, or Roy Jenkins, President of the European Commission, who did so much to pave the way for our single currency. I think of these thousands of European civil servants of British nationality who devoted their lives and their careers to Europe and have done so much to build our Union. They will always stay part of our family. And I think of all those years so many British MEPs have contributed to making this Parliament and the Union strong. You have our gratitude and our respect, even more so for your resilience in the last 3.5 years. We will miss you, but we will always keep up our friendship with you, and you can count on us, as we know that we can count on you. Honourable Members, in the last plenary session we discussed the issues of citizens’ rights. We will also be vigilant on the implementation of the agreement in Northern Ireland. The power-sharing agreement in Northern Ireland gives us hope that the spirit of cooperation will continue to mark relations across the border. Yet the Withdrawal Agreement is only a first step. From now on it’s about our new partnership with the United Kingdom. The negotiations are about to start. And just to be very clear: I want the European Union and the United Kingdom to stay good friends and good partners. The story is about old friends and new beginnings, and we have a lot in common. We both believe that climate change needs to be fought as a matter of urgency. There’s still scope to address these risks, but the window of opportunity is closing. So let’s join forces in protecting our planet. We both understand that it takes very little power to break a fragile balance and turn it into a full-blown conflict but that the true power lies in putting the pieces back together. And therefore we both believe in the power of development cooperation, and we know that our security is interlinked. And here too we should join forces. For all these and many other reasons, we want to forge a close partnership, but we also know that we have to sort out how to deal with the United Kingdom as a third country. When it comes to trade, we are considering a free trade agreement with zero tariffs and zero quotas. This would be unique; no other free trade agreement offers such an access to our single market. But the precondition is that European and British businesses continue to compete on a level playing field. We will certainly not expose our companies to unfair competition. And it’s very clear: the trade-off is simple. The more united the United Kingdom does commit to uphold our standards for social protection and workers’ rights, our guarantees for the environment and other standards and rules ensuring fair competition, the closer and better the access to the single market. And let me say that, just days ago, some of the largest business associations in Britain – particularly in the car and aerospace industry – asked their government to retain EU standards and rules. And I think this is in our mutual interest. This is about jobs, it’s about common solutions for the world market. And I believe that the United Kingdom and the European Union have a mutual interest in the closest possible partnership. Honourable Members, no new partnership will bring back the benefits of being part of the same Union, but we have a duty to seek the best for the British and for the European people in a post-Brexit world. On our side, we’ll seek the best for industries and farmers across our continent who ask for predictability. We will seek our best for young British and young European students who want to study and who want to live across the Channel. And we’ll seek the best for all the researchers and scientists who want to explore the unknown and work for common solutions together in the European Union as well as in the United Kingdom. We will devote all our energy, 24/7, to come to results. And to our British friends, and many – perhaps not all, but many – of our British MEPs here in the room, I want to use the words of the famous British poet George Eliot. She said: only in the agony of parting do we look into the depth of love. We will always love you, and we will never be far. Long live Europe.

For me it was a trip to Great Britain. I was in England as an 18-year-old boy with Interrail. I stood in a bar. I spoke with an old man, a Guinness in my hand, and we talked about history. He spoke about our fears towards the future, our values. And I understood that we as Europeans have similar fears, hopes; face the same global challenges and stand on the same ground: our European way of life. Great Britain is now leaving. This week is a sad day for the European Union. Great Britain did so much for prosperity, for peace and democracy in Europe. They will leave us. We cannot change it, but – I have to be clear again – it is a huge mistake. I want to thank also, like my previous speakers, our British colleagues and all the staff members who served in this European Parliament. On Friday you will leave a unique institution and one of the greatest projects in European history: the place of European democracy. And I’ll tell you again: we will miss you. Now we have the Leave Treaty on the table: a good agreement which creates certainty. I also want to thank Jean-Claude Juncker, Donald Tusk, Guy Verhofstadt and especially Michel Barnier for their work. Especially our Irish friends got a good understanding of what it means to be part of a big family. The British-Irish history is not an easy one, but it was clear during the last three years: Dublin and Leo Varadkar were strong due to the membership in the European Union. Togetherness makes you stronger: that is the lesson which our Irish friends learned. And we must keep known the unity. We will focus now on the partnership and friendship with the UK. But one thing is clear: the UK will be a third country. And that means the rules will change. I want to identify two main points on behalf of the EPP. It was the decision of the UK to limit the transition period. We have always shown understanding and flexibility, but we will not allow the EU to be put under pressure and reach a rushed final agreement. We are ready for intensive talks, but in the end, we want to have the best agreement, not the quickest one. And the second thing I want to remind us is: once you’re part of a union, you can enjoy the advantages; once you’re not part of a union, you’re losing the advantages. That has nothing to do with punishment; that is simply the outcome of the decision of the British voters. And let me say it in other words: there will be no cherry picking, no European Singapore next to our markets. We only will grant them access to our market if they respect the European rules. And I also want to add: we defend not only the rules on market base. We tell, for example, Norway and Switzerland that they can only have access to the single market if they respect also the freedom of movement. That’s the same for great Britain: we do not allow trucks to cross our borders without control and people to be stopped. That is not the idea of our European Union; there is not a dream you’re dreaming. And dear colleagues, a final word on what also Guy Verhofstadt underlined about the lesson we have to learn out of the Brexit developments. To avoid another Brexit debate in one of our Member States, we need a European Union that is ready to act: results, outcomes, positive contributions to the daily life of our citizens is in the centre of our work, and that’s why, again, to the colleagues who will leave us – in my Group it was Julie Girling, it was Richard Ashworth, Richard Corbett, other friends here in the plenary – I tell you, I hope our work in the next years will make Europe so strong, so attractive, that your children and grandchildren will want to be part of the European Union once again. I hope one day they will vote again for this unique institution and will send European members from Britain to the European Parliament. Thank you so much. We will work hard on this.

At the end of this week, after 47 years, the United Kingdom will end its historic relationship with the European Union. We are devastated to see the UK go. We respect the decision of the British people, but their sovereign decision is not an ideal for us to denounce the political leaders who influenced British public opinion through a populist and uninformed campaign; the British right ended up devoured in its particular civil war over the English far right and the Brexit referendum usit usd the era of fake news against a back-to-back of general population disenthing after years of austerity.  The European Union is much more than a market and we need to move forward. We are building an area of rights, security and social progress where many British and British people, especially Labour, have broken down for decades, including sacrificing their lives, as was the case with murdered Labour MP Jo Cox. Therefore, there is no better way to honour his memory than to work day by day for a Europe that died defending.  Populism has won with its best weapon: lying. But let no one doubt that this is a pristine victory and the best evidence of this is the withdrawal agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union which this House is about to adopt. This Agreement demonstrates that our historical ties will prevail over those who aspire to destroy them.  On the one hand, the Withdrawal Agreement guarantees the rights of European citizens in the United Kingdom and the rights of British citizens in the European Union, and on the other hand, avoids the lifting of the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, because the membership of the two countries in the European Union has had a crucial effect : make the border separating Northern Ireland from Ireland irrelevant and reducing the tension of the conflict.  Another example that demonstrates the unfavourable victory achieved by British populism is the negotiation on our new future relationship. On 1 February, the UK will formally become a third country and lose all its political rights. But in everything else nothing will change until the end of the transitional period. The history of the United Kingdom and that of the European Union is one. We also share our laws and values. If the British people ever decide to come back, our arms will be open.

For us Greens and European Free Alliance members, it will be a sad day. It’s no secret that each and every one of us fought relentlessly to keep the United Kingdom as part of the European Union: not because we think that whatever the European Union does is the right thing, but because we firmly believe that the only way for Europeans to regain sovereignty – that is, the ability to shape our future – is by sharing it. As Jean-Claude Juncker once said, there are two sorts of European States: the small ones and those who don’t yet realise they are small. But more importantly, we see the European Union as an unprecedented, if fragile, attempt at building a transnational democracy. Such an experiment may come in handy at a time when not just Europe but the entire world is facing challenges beyond the might of any single nation. Citizens, we fought the battle and we lost. Last December’s election provided a result, but not the one we wished. In two days from now, Brexit will happen and, in order for it to be orderly, we will vote for the Withdrawal Agreement. The United Kingdom and the EU remain bound by geography. It is in no-one’s interest to have bad relations as neighbours. But more fundamentally, we European decision-makers must realise that, if an increasing number of our fellow citizens have turned their backs against the European project, it’s for a reason. It’s because many believe that too often, policies adopted at European level have served the interests of the few rather than of the many. And we need to fix this. We need to fix this if we really want to avoid the repetition of Brexit happening. Let us make it our utmost priority that, from now on, our aim will be that all our policies will strive to serve the interests of everyone, starting with the most vulnerable, and do this while respecting the limits that nature imposes on us. The European Green Deal announced by the European Commission is an opportunity to take the right course. Let us seize it.

There was a referendum in 1975, which went in favour of continued membership. There was no continuity leave campaign after that; people accepted the result with good grace. They did not seek to overturn it. Indeed, Euroscepticism was confined to the fringes of the Bennite left. What changed, frankly, was the Maastricht Treaty. Up until that moment, it was still possible to see the EU as a club of nations, as an association of states primarily concerned with trade and economics. But after Maastricht it became clear that EU jurisdiction was being extended into a whole series of completely uneconomic fields: foreign policy, culture, migration, citizens’ rights etc., etc., and that the aspiration was to have the EU as a quasi—state with a flag and a parliament and a currency and a president and external embassies and all the other accoutrements. If, at any stage, Britain had been able to have a trade—only association, of course that would have been enough. In fact, even as recently as February 2016, if David Cameron had come back with any repatriation of power, can we doubt that he would have won the ensuing referendum? But, faced with the departure of its second financial contributor, the EU was still not prepared to allow any devolution of power and that, ultimately, is what made a parting of ways inevitable.

My mother and father signed up to a common market, not to a political union, not to flags, anthems, presidents – and now you even want your own army. For me, it’s been 27 years of campaigning and over 20 years here in this Parliament. I’m not particularly happy with the agreement we’re being asked to vote on tonight, but Boris has been remarkably bold in the last few months and, Ms von der Leyen, he’s made it clear: he’s promised us there’ll be no level playing field. And, on that basis, I wish him every success in the next round of negotiations, I really do. But the most significant point is this: what happens at 11p.m. this Friday, 31 January 2020 marks the point of no return. Once we’ve left we are never coming back, and the rest, frankly, is detail. We’re going, we will be gone – and that should be the summit of my own political ambitions. I walked in here – as I’ve said before, you all thought it was terribly funny, you stopped laughing in 2016 – but my view has changed of Europe since I joined. In 2005, I saw the Constitution that had been drafted by Giscard and others. I saw it rejected by the French in a referendum. I saw it rejected by the Dutch in a referendum. And I saw you, in these institutions, ignore them, bring it back as the Lisbon Treaty and boast you could ram it through without there being referendums. Well, the Irish did have a vote and did say no and were forced to vote again. You’re very good at making people vote again. But what we proved is, the British are too big to bully, thank goodness. So I became an outright opponent of the entire European project. I want Brexit to start a debate across the rest of Europe. What do we want from Europe? If we want trade, friendship, cooperation, reciprocity, we don’t need a European Commission. We don’t need a European Court. We don’t need these institutions and all of this power. And I can promise you, both in UKIP and indeed in the Brexit party, we love Europe; we just hate the European Union. It’s a simple as that. So I’m hoping this begins the end of this project. It’s a bad project. It isn’t just undemocratic, it’s anti—democratic, and it puts in that front row, it gives people power without accountability – people who cannot be held to account by the electorate. And that is an unacceptable structure. Indeed, there’s an historic battle going on now across the West: in Europe, America and elsewhere. It is globalism against populism. And you may loathe populism, but I’ll tell you a funny thing, it’s becoming very popular, and it has great benefits: no more financial contributions, no more European Court of Justice, no more common fisheries policy, no more being talked down to, no more being bullied, no more Guy Verhofstadt.

I speak here as EPP representative in the Brexit steering group but also as the former Chair of the Constitutional Affairs Committee who had all those Brexiteers and nearly 500 meetings with all those potentially affected by Brexit. From the very beginning of the negotiations, the EU side has aimed for an orderly withdrawal based on an agreement. This is the only thing we could do to give legal certainty to the process, and we have achieved this goal. I hope most of us will endorse the consent to the Council Decision on the conclusion of this agreement to avoid a hard Brexit. From the very beginning of this process, we have been also clear that UK withdrawal is not a final destination. Now we should aim at a close comprehensive agreement on the future relationship, preferably in the form of an association agreement embracing both close economic partnership and security cooperation. We know that the UK political choice has been taking back control. So yes, we are aware that, if the UK aims at divergence from European norms and standards, it can put at risk even a bare-bone FTA. That is why a well-tailored agreement on a level playing field will be crucial, Mr Farage. But there is ahead of us, as the European Parliament, also the task to have a watchful eye on the implementation and enforcement of the withdrawal agreement. Of particular importance for us will be the oversight of the implementation of citizens’ rights and of the Irish protocol.

That was like saying to the British public: you had your say three years ago (four years ago now); now you have to shut up and accept whatever I come up with, no matter how bad it is and no matter how different it is from what he promised. Four years ago, Johnson and his Leave campaign said this would all be easy; it’s turned out to be rather difficult. They said it would save lots of money that would all go to the NHS; it’s turning out to cost a fortune. They said it would be good for Britain and the economy; the opposite is true. That’s why the British public voted 53% in our elections for parties demanding another referendum. Brexit does not have the wholehearted consent of the British people, and that’s for very good reasons: it bears no resemblance to what they were promised. Nor will his promise to ‘get Brexit done’ on 31 January turn out to be anything like true. That’s the beginning of the next phase: negotiations to settle issues which will prove very difficult. Britain has to make difficult choices. Will it want to stay close to the European Union, aligned with the rules, or distance itself? If it distances itself, it has huge economic costs. If it aligns itself, it has to follow the rules without having a say on them anymore. Neither is actually good for Britain. And that’s why public opinion will continue to move against Brexit. That’s why I predict that the catchphrase next year in our media and social media will be ‘Brexit isn’t working’.

The advance of the EU juggernaut through Monnet’s small steps was sometimes hardly noticed.

The negotiation this year of a free trade agreement and other arrangements should be seen as an opportunity, not a confrontation. It’s in the interests of both the EU and the UK for a good agreement, negotiated with goodwill and flexibility, based on precedent, to be concluded in friendship and before the end of the year. Britain will still be a European power – the leading European power in NATO, committed to the security of the democracies of the European continent, sharing many of the standpoints and aspirations of the nations of Europe, an independent sovereign country with friendly relations with the EU: that’s our aim.

We will not consent to barbed wire. There is no doubt that the Irish protocol in the withdrawal agreement is an ugly compromise, but it’s better than a crash—out Brexit.  However, partition and Brexit are ugly impositions that have burdened Ireland for years. Because of partition, Brexit is stripping away our democratic and social rights. But because of Brexit, a dynamic conversation about Irish unity has been invigorated. The EU Council made its contribution to Irish unity when, on the 29th of April 2017, 27 Member States agreed that, if Ireland is reunified, the whole of Ireland is in the EU.  The partition of Ireland is not only a problem for us in Ireland. The 300 mile border, with 320 border crossings, is now your problem too. When Britain gets its empire back, showing it cares nothing about your level playing field, and when  shady low-standard products with minimum protection make their way into your market, you will not be long in joining the sensible people in supporting Irish unity.

First of all, the root cause why the UK is leaving is because the leaders of the parties at Westminster, the two big parties, live in a fantasy world. They work in ancient buildings. The buildings were built for an empire, and they still think they’re running an empire and are a superpower. Consequently, they have never told the British people the reality that we are a European country and not a superpower, and even our children in the schools are not taught in the curriculum about Europe. So there has been an abject failure by Westminster. Sadly, in this debate, Farage, who’s gone, and Hannan, who I think is still in there, told a complete untruth. This project was never about free trade. It was always about more than free trade and ever-closer Union. Even Mrs Thatcher, in the referendum campaign in 1975, said this is about more than just free trade. So when they talk about free trade only, it’s been misleading the British people all the way along. And that’s a disgrace. The last thing I want to say is, I’ve been privileged enough to have been elected here for the first time in 1979 – a very long time ago – and I still want to see next (it isn’t finished) the construction of a European FBI to fight cross-border crime, because our police forces – we have 500 in Europe – none of them can cross borders and pursue the criminals.

Why do I say that here and now? Because, yes, the European Union is complicated, slow, sometimes non—transparent, but it is the closest we have come to what Schmidt meant. For me, the European Union is not only about trade and about finances – it is about values and it is about peace. My father is English. He was born in 1935, not far from a Royal Air Force Base and he loved, as a kid, to see the bombers rise into the sky. My mother is German, she was born in 1940 and she fled through the city of Dresden, the day after it was bombed. So the image that the bombers my father cherished almost killed my mother is something that brought me into politics in the first place. It will always be this image that keeps me going and that will keep me being a bridge between these two countries, a ‘bridge over troubled water’ at the moment, as Art Garfunkel would say.

The United Kingdom, following a referendum in which a majority of citizens were democratically expressed, chose to leave the Union. We have, for many of us, regretted and we will continue to regret this vote, but we have respected it and therefore the task entrusted to us in the Commission by the governments, by you, has been to work to organise this withdrawal. If the treaty before you has any quality, ladies and gentlemen - I will take Guy Verhofstadt's word - it is to organise the withdrawal of the United Kingdom in an orderly manner. Brexit, much more and far more than anyone who has explained or understood it to us, has innumerable human and social consequences, both technically and legally, financially and economically, and it is not over yet. What we have tried to do in this treaty, objectively, patiently and respectfully, has been to provide legal answers or assurances for all those and for all sectors where Brexit, like a divorce, creates innumerable uncertainties. First, citizens and their rights have been your priority since the beginning of this negotiation. We have worked for this treaty in this spirit: an orderly withdrawal. And we've done a lot of work: a hundred Brexit steering group meetings, 17 plenary sessions and then I've had the honour of reporting to most of your groups several times. At this time, I would like to say a special word to Guy Verhofstadt for the intelligence and objectivity with which he led the work of the Brexit steering group for three years, to each and every member of this group and to all those who have worked for this group, including the General Secretariat of Parliament and your colleagues. You will allow me to tell you that we will continue, in the coming year, in the same spirit, with the same respect, with the same objectivity, without any aggression, but by firmly defending the interests of the Union and its Member States, on the line and in accordance with the principles reiterated earlier by our President Ursula von der Leyen for the future relationship. Always with the perspective - I have always worked with this perspective - that beyond Brexit, the UK will stay there. Close partner in terms of the economy, ally as he has always been and friend. We will therefore work to recreate a new legal framework for this alliance between the European Union and the United Kingdom, to consolidate this friendship and to make this partnership work. We will have a second task, ladies and gentlemen, Mr President, which is not insignificant and should not be forgotten: it is to implement this agreement in all its dimensions and it will be our job this year to get it up and running at the end of the year. I am thinking of the rights of citizens and I am also thinking specifically of Ireland and Northern Ireland, where peace remains very fragile. You will, in turn, allow me, as our President has done, to greet all the British Members and all those who, in one way or another, have worked for 47 years to build this European project. Personally, I have the memory of many of you and several elected officials. I am thinking of Andrew Duff and Richard Corbett during the work of the convention. I am also thinking of the two moments when I had the honour of being European Commissioner for the Internal Market and before in regional policy, in Malcom Harbour, Vicky Ford, Sharon Bowles and so many of you in the diversity of the groups you represent, with whom I have always had fruitful, important and useful discussions. I wanted to thank you personally. You will just allow me to conclude with three brief messages. The first is that throughout this negotiation and in the coming year, our task has been and will be to deal with the consequences of Brexit, but I recommend, as many of you have said very forcefully, that in our political responsibility - and I remain a politician - we take time to listen to the popular sentiment that has been expressed during Brexit , which is also expressed in many of our regions: that we take time to learn the lessons of Brexit. The second point is based on a lecture given one day by a man whom I like, whom I respect, who was my colleague at the European Commission, Conservative and British, Chris Patten. One day in Dublin, he gave a lecture that he concluded with this question: can the defence of the national interest be only national? Can the defence of the national interest be only, only, national. One could ask the question in another way: should we not be European in addition to being patriotic? I say well: in addition, not instead of being patriotic. I am convinced that we can, that we must be patriotic - I am passionately - and at the same time European, and that this European dimension gives more strength to our national patriotism. (Applause) Mr President, let me finish with a short message I passed on in Belfast on Monday at Queen's University: in this new beginning, I would really and sincerely like to wish the UK well.

I am glad that a no-deal brexit will be avoided, but sad that the British decided to leave.  When you look back at history, you can easily say that Brexit has been going on for a long time. The final straw was the surrender of British Conservatives to anti-EU pressure and the promise of a referendum. It was a historic mistake. I think it is honest to say quite frankly that the result of the referendum was largely based on incomplete information and on completely unsubsent promises that are extremely difficult for those who make it to deliver. Brexit is a sad example of where populism can lead.  The EYES of the EU and the UK must now be directed immediately at new negotiations to determine the future relationship between the Union and The United Kingdom. The timetable for the negotiations is extremely tight. However, an agreement must be sought that guarantees a close relationship between the EU and the UK and creates as few obstacles as possible. The possibility for people to continue to seek employment and studies, as well as the smooth trading of companies, i.e. the movement of goods and services across borders, are the most fundamental issues. The relationship between the EU and the UK is also of great importance from a foreign and security policy perspective. Britain is europe's largest military power.

I would like to take this opportunity, before signing the official act, to share with you some comments. Of course, we are all deeply saddened to think that we have reached this point and that a long-standing partner member and friend of the European Union has decided to leave the Family of the Union. I still remember the feeling of bewilderment we all had when news spread in June 2016 of the UK's decision to leave the European Union. Of course, we have always fully respected the decision of the people of the United Kingdom and their willingness to build a different future outside the European Union. On behalf of Parliament, I would like to express to my fellow Members who will be leaving us today – it will be the last plenary session – our gratitude and deepest feelings of gratitude for the contribution they have made over the years. Your presence, our British friends, has enriched our institution and it is certain that we will miss you. We all lose colleagues and allies with whom we have close relations and with whom we have worked side by side over the years here in the European Parliament. Fifty years of integration cannot easily dissolve. We will all have to work now to build new relationships, always putting interests and the protection of citizens' rights at the centre, and we know that there will also be difficult times. I am sure, however, that we will be able to overcome any divergence and always find a meeting point. Leave the European Union, but you will of course continue to be part of Europe because of the values that hold us together and that unite us deeply.  Dear British friends, of course saying goodbye is too demanding and definitive. That is why, together with all my colleagues, I say goodbye. And I want to greet you with the words that Jo Cox, the British MEMBER killed during an election campaign, said: 'we have much more in common than divides us'. Thank you. I will now sign the letter to the Council approving Parliament's conclusion of the agreement on the withdrawal of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland from the European Union.

It is caused by a novel coronavirus and there are already thousands of cases and more than 100 people have died. This is a place where hundreds of EU citizens live and work and I will come back to that later but let me first give a few details about the outbreak of this disease. The Presidency takes this issue very seriously. We monitor the situation in close cooperation with Member States, authorities, EU institutions, bodies and agencies and with international organisations such as the World Health Organisation. The first cases were reported on 31 December 2019. Already on 9 January, the Chinese authorities reported that the outbreak was caused by the novel coronavirus. It is genetically closely related to the virus that caused more than 8 000 cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome, better known as SARS.  First, I’d like to state that available data about the virus transmissibility and fatality rates should be treated with caution as the situation is still evolving. What we know is that the virus causes a potentially very dangerous illness, as the mortality rate of the 2019 virus seems to be lower than the SARS, but it is still very high: about 3 percentage of the cases, varying with age, and the incubation period during which any infected persons can infect others seems to be longer. It is, therefore, potentially a serious threat.  As I speak, over 6 000 cases of coronavirus infections have been confirmed in China and Southeast Asia and regrettably 132 persons have died. So far, to the best of our knowledge, no EU citizen currently in China has been infected but some isolated cases have been reported in Europe. In the beginning, victims seemed to have been infected by animals, but in recent days first the Chinese and then the German authorities have confirmed human—to—human transmission of the virus. This increases the potential of the virus to infect a large number of people. As you know, the Commission has the possibility and duty to assist Member States, in particular, in cases of cross—border health threats and Member States’ competent authorities follow the developments very closely. The Health Security Committee, which deals with serious cross—border threats to health and which involves all Member States and the Commission, has already met three times to exchange information about the outbreak and will of course be involved in the further coordination of the response to this health threat. As you know, we also have a specialised European Agency active in this field: the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It now provides, on an almost daily basis, updates about the situation. I dare, therefore, say that, as regards the threat to public health in Europe we have sufficient expertise available to handle the situation. Furthermore, Member States’ authorities are very vigilant to further developments and, as long as there is adherence to appropriate prevention and control practices, there is a low likelihood that secondary cases will occur in the European Union. If, however, a person infected outside Europe would be discovered late, the risk of secondary transmission would be high, so we need to remain vigilant. Let me now further outline what we have undertaken so far. On Monday, we very swiftly activated the EU’s Integrated Political Crisis Response mechanism for enhanced information sharing among Member States, the Commission and the European External Action Service. This mechanism brings together, under the steer of the Council Presidency, all relevant experts from the Member States and the European Union institutions, such as in fields of health, consular affairs and civil protection. It is an effective tool to support a collective horizontal response covering both the European Union internal and external dimension of the situation. The objective at this stage is to facilitate information sharing across relevant sectors based on expert input from all EU services so as to gain a common understanding of the situation and the latest developments. As regards the need for repatriation of EU citizens, it should be noted that consular affairs fall under Member States’ competence, but, of course, also here we have means for cooperation. We also called on Monday a telephone conference among the Member States. Through these coordination and facilitation efforts we are giving Member States the opportunity to update and support each other on their repatriation plans. Close cooperation between the Council structures and preparatory bodies will enable us to reach, effectively and in an appropriate manner, whatever way the situation develops. We have taken this step proactively to ensure we are prepared. We are looking forward to hearing from the Commission about their work, which is closely linked to our efforts. For example, as regards the activation of the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, which has been requested by several Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 5, "mortality": 1, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 99, "date": "2020-01-29.json", "name": "Stella Kyriakides", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Honourable Members, I’m very grateful to have this opportunity to inform you about the EU’s preparedness and response to the developing situation of the coronavirus, which was first reported in China one month ago. Latest reports from this morning indicate just over 6 000 laboratory-confirmed cases and 132 deaths. All the deaths have occurred in China. The situation is evolving very rapidly and has potentially serious public health implications. We have seen that the World Health Organization is again convening the International Health Regulations Emergency Committee on the situation tomorrow to advise on whether the current outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern. We will follow these discussions very closely. My priority as Commissioner in charge of health is to make sure that we as the Commission provide all the support to Member States. This means that the Commission is monitoring the situation very closely and has taken action to support national measures and coordinate the response of Member States. This takes place via the EU’s early warning and response system, where information is exchanged in real time, as well as discussions with Member States in the Health Security Committee, which has met three times. I’m also in regular contact with the Director-General of the World Health Organization and its regional director in Europe to coordinate next steps at a global level. This ensures essential and immediate information exchange and a coordinated Europe-wide response, which is, of course, the Commission’s primary responsibility. Ladies and gentlemen, the vast majority of cases have been identified in China, but last week, cases have also been confirmed in other parts of the world, including Europe. At the moment we have four confirmed cases in France, four confirmed cases in Germany, and we also have information that a case has just been confirmed in Finland. I am in continuous contact with the French, Italian, German and Croatian health ministers, and I am assured that the necessary steps to contain the virus have been taken. On Monday the EU’s Health Security Committee met to discuss preparedness and needs of Member States and response options on the basis of the updated risk assessment from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. I have been reassured that the vast majority of European countries reported a high level of preparedness to face the coronavirus in Europe, including access to laboratory diagnosis networks; readiness for clinical diagnosis and management of cases; guidance for travellers; capacities and guidance for management of points of entry; and guidance for healthcare professionals and the public on how to deal with suspected cases. An important topic is the repatriation of EU citizens from China: the Hubei region, more precisely, where the epidemic is concentrated. On Tuesday, France activated the EU Civil Protection Mechanism. We hope that as soon as possible, EU citizens will be able to come back to Europe. The details are being coordinated as we speak and the EU emergency response centre is supporting the efforts of Member States. There remain at the moment important uncertainties surrounding the coronavirus such as its origins, its transmission mode and its pathogenicity. So we need to continue to monitor this situation very closely. It’s clear that rapid communication, sharing of information and close cooperation are paramount to tackle this outbreak effectively. If the situation deteriorates, we will consider all other tools to strengthen our support to Member States, and this would include emergency funding to support outbreak response and, of course, research, where our supercomputer centres stand ready to sequence and simulate the evolution of the virus, which can help researchers develop a vaccine.

In particular, the case identified the day before yesterday in Germany is based on contagion within Germany, that is, within the European Union. So we have not only imported cases of people infected in China, but also contagion within the European Union. That, of course, is already changing the situation. We really should take it very seriously and be very vigilant! On the other hand, I am also with those who say: do not panic now! We have other health risks, such as normal influenza, which currently kills many more people in Europe than the novel corona virus. One thing is clear, however: we need European cooperation in the event of such threats as those now posed by the new Corona virus. It is good that the Member States inform each other very quickly and that no one keeps any information for themselves. I would like the recommendations to be consistent, that if you live in a border area – for example, between Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands – you do not have different recommendations and different procedures at airports. We should do this together, because the viruses know no borders. It is very important for me that we make an appeal to China. There is a great deal of mistrust in Europe, but obviously also among the Chinese people, whether the Chinese authorities have really told us the whole truth and whether they have passed on the necessary information quickly enough. I cannot judge that. I believe, however, that there is simply a doctrine in China that transparency is not the top priority. That must change! We must appeal to China to tell its own people and to us the whole truth, so that we can respond really well. Covering up is not a solution.

I will try to touch on as many questions as possible. I hope, in the way that I spoke at the beginning, I did not appear to stir up panic. This was not the intention, and as Veronique Trillet-Lenoir has said, we should not create panic. But we need to balance that with being vigilant and carefully monitoring a changing situation, which is what we have at the moment. There are many uncertainties – many of you have mentioned this. The WHO has issued guidelines, together with ECDC, for travel, and I would also like to add here that we really don’t have any indications, as has been said by some colleagues and by Madam Montserrat, that China is not giving all the necessary information. In fact, the WHO General Director was there two days ago and has already briefed us on what the situation is. It’s obvious that we need to have global cooperation and we need to have constant updates. We do need to be very careful that we are speaking with one clear voice, and this is exactly what we are trying to do in our coordinating role as a Commission, to ensure that ECDC info and WHO information reaches the Member States. In terms of vaccinations, the Commission is launching a call to develop a vaccine as we speak, and the European Medicines Authority can authorise a fast-track procedure if this is found. There is concern among European citizens, and WHO and ECDC have given clear guidelines on travel precautions and laboratory testing and isolation, and our information from Member States is that, once EU citizens are repatriated, quarantine measures will be taken. We have joined forces with as many other entities and bodies as possible, and Member States have assured us through the CDC that their laboratories are ready. Finally, I wanted to say that, under the Union Civil Protection Mechanism, further emergency assistance can be provided if requested, including emergency medical corps, which can be deployed both inside and outside the European Union. So I will stop here. I just want to be absolutely emphatic that we are going to continue to monitor this very closely.

At this stage, we do not consider that the situation in Europe constitutes a crisis.

Despite some important gains in the recognition of the rights of indigenous peoples in many countries of the world, in recent years we have also seen a number of setbacks. Most troubling are the high numbers of indigenous leaders and activists killed every year in the defence of their ancestral lands and the environment – at least 40 persons every year. Such tragic crimes underline the high relevance of our policies on support to indigenous peoples and human rights defenders working on land, environment, biodiversity and climate. Specifically on human rights defenders, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights funds the EU Human Rights Defenders Mechanism, which provided support to more than 30 000 HRDs from 2015 to 2019 and their families through a combination of short-, medium- and long-term initiatives. The EU’s support to land governance and secure access and tenure of land is equally important. While we continue to foster dialogue and promote respect for responsible land governance, the EU is supporting land governance in about 40 countries, with a total budget of 240 million euros. As an example, I mention the EU support to land governance in Colombia, which enabled the collective titling of 280 000 hectares, benefiting some 8 000 indigenous and Afro-Colombian families. Indigenous peoples also feature highly in our enhanced attention to the human rights and environment and climate nexus. During the European Development Days held in June of 2019, the EEAS organised an event dedicated to the strengthening of international solidarity and support to indigenous peoples and environmental human rights defenders. Another event at the EDDS on non-discrimination and the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation brought testimonies from indigenous experts, along with other experts on other frequently-discriminated groups. Furthermore, the 21st Annual EU NGO Human Rights Forum meeting in December 2019 under the theme of building a fair environmental future had a specific session dedicated to indigenous peoples. Indigenous experts, including the UN Special Rapporteur on the rights of indigenous peoples, along with indigenous youth, had prominent speaking roles, allowing them – together with the invited indigenous participants – to bring forward concerns as possible contributions of indigenous peoples in building a fair environmental future. The afore-mentioned Council Conclusions underscore the crucial importance of further enhancing opportunities for dialogue and consultation with indigenous peoples at all levels of EU cooperation. This includes EU-funded programmes and projects under all aid modalities to secure the full participation of indigenous people; their free, prior, and informed consent in a meaningful and systematic way; and also to inform and underpin EU External Action policy and its implementation worldwide. In follow-up to the Council Conclusions, on 24 and 25 February in Brussels we will host a round table with indigenous peoples’ representatives as well as experts from the four indigenous socio-cultural regions of the world. The specific objectives of the round table will be the identification of the most prevalent and emerging threats to indigenous people’s rights, and to generate recommendations on how to best address indigenous people’s rights through EU policy and action. Mr President, please allow me now to mention briefly some examples of support that we provide in the context of indigenous peoples’ languages. In Namibia, the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights contributed to the revitalisation of endangered indigenous languages. In the Chittagong Hill Tracts of Bangladesh, we have also helped develop a multilingual mother-tongue education programme in seven different tribal languages as part of the 500 million the EU invests annually in education programmes in around 60 countries across the world. Such programmes and projects can be seen as the EU’s contribution to the success of the International Decade of Indigenous Languages 2020-2029, which was proclaimed by the United Nations General Assembly in December of last year. Let me assure you and the honourable Members of the EU’s strong commitment to the rights of indigenous peoples as part of our human rights policies. As such, we remain firmly committed to their promotion and respect through all aspects of EU external policies, cooperation and trade, as well as through political dialogues with third countries in regional and multilateral lateral fora and by giving financial support.

More than 80% of the world's biodiversity is in your care, as well as the vast majority of forests. Although there are only 370 million people who identify as members of indigenous peoples, they are responsible for almost a quarter of the planet, and are therefore the first to suffer the effects of extreme climate change and the struggle for resources. From Asia to the Amazon, from the Arctic to Oceania, indigenous communities fight to defend their heritage and history, and when they do, they are constantly victims of attacks, occupation, militarization of territories, intimidation, violence and torture that so often lead to death – actions dictated by the voracious of extractive industries, deforestation, mining, agribusiness, with total impunity and so often by the action of the States themselves. At a recent meeting of the indigenous peoples of the Amazon, Chief Raoni Metuktire, a finalist for the Sakharov Prize, said that in Brazil, threats to these communities and environmentalists have been dramatically escalated. The policies advocated by the Bolsonaro government for indigenous territories represent genocide, ethnocide and ecocidium, and I underline these words. Indigenous peoples are one of the most unprotected peoples in the world. They make up only 5% of the population, but represent 15% of people living in poverty.

The EU follows closely the situation of human rights in Brazil, particularly human rights defenders, indigenous peoples and all those working to protect land, environment, biodiversity and climate. Indigenous peoples feature prominently also in our comprehensive and sustained contact and cooperation with Brazil, for instance by regular visits by the EU delegation in Brasília, to different regions and indigenous communities, regular visits by the EU Special Representative for Human Rights as well. The last edition of the EU-Brazil dialogue on human rights was on 9 October 2019, and it included a focus on indigenous peoples, human rights defenders, labour standards, businesses and human rights, and children’s and women’s rights, which already also were mentioned here tonight. And in particular we voiced our concern on the situation of indigenous peoples and human rights defenders. Our offer of cooperation was positively appreciated by the Brazilians, and as a positive follow-up to this dialogue, Brazil invited the EU Special Representative for Human Rights, Mr Gilmore, to visit the country during 2020 as a mid-term review of the joint work carried out in these areas between annual dialogues. The EU-Mercosur Association Agreement would serve as a valuable tool to further promote the protection of human rights and to address environmental issues in Brazil and the region. It includes provisions on human rights, indigenous peoples and cooperation on sustainable development. It will provide for upgraded mechanisms for enhanced political dialogue and cooperation between the two sides of these issues. These include specific mechanisms for EU-Mercosur dialogue and exchanges between parties, including at the level of parliaments and civil societies of both regions. In the trade part, a trade and sustainable development chapter provides for binding commitment to the effective implementation of the multilateral environmental agreements – including the Paris Agreement – ratified by each of the parties.

Languages are a key component of human rights and fundamental freedoms and are also important for achieving sustainable development, as local knowledge, collective knowledge and experience of indigenous communities are encoded in these languages. Thus, this knowledge, which also contributes to overcoming global environmental challenges, can only be passed on to future generations through these intermediary languages. It is therefore of the utmost importance to protect and promote the use of these languages. Ensuring adequate education is essential for the survival of indigenous languages.

It is based on shared values of democracy, rule of law, respect for human rights, commitment to the rules-based global order, effective multilateralism and sustainable development.  The President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission will host the Prime Minister of India for the 15th EU-India summit on 13 March here in Brussels. We have a rich, frank and open dialogue with India on all issues of common interest, as well as on issues where we might have different perspectives.  The High Representative/Vice-President of the Commission was in India on 16 and 17 January, where he discussed the preparation for the summit. On this occasion, the Minister for External Affairs and Prime Minister Modi reaffirmed their strong interest for a deepened strategic partnership with the European Union.  The issue that you are debating today was also part of the discussions, and the HR/VP enquired about the risk of discrimination among refugees and migrants on religious grounds under the revised legislation. He also drew the attention of his interlocutors to the need to ensure compliance of national legislation with international law. Beyond this point, we believe that it is the role of the Supreme Court of India to assess compliance of the law with the Constitution and we are confident that the ongoing judicial process will contribute to appeasing the tensions and violence witnessed over the past weeks in the country.

That is why it is important for us to see what is going on in the country. If we realise that there are difficulties, and even violence and deaths, due to an amended law or other planned legal changes , such as the Registration Act – then that is a point where we are looking more closely. We are doing this in this context, and it is important that we get smart about how to assess the situation here. The law as such does not take anything away from an existing right. There are twelve years as a deadline for all who have lived legally in India, whether they are Muslims or Christians or belong to other faiths or ethnicities. In this case, it is more of a selective privilege, that is, positive discrimination. The question then arises as to whether there is any real criticism in this context. The criticism that I am sure we can make is that, in the context of the debate on this law, the law on the registration of citizens is also being revised. There are fears that many citizens will not be able to prove that they actually have a right to be in India. I believe that clarity must be provided here.

No, they’re the good guys. They’ve taken in the refugees. This motion does not censure any of those three Muslim countries for having created this refugee crisis. The UN Minorities Declaration of 1992 states that minorities can be classified as national, ethnic, religious, linguistic or cultural. This act, the CAA, is just focused on persecuted religious minorities seeking refuge in India. Thus, Muslims coming from those three Muslim countries cannot be considered minorities. Muslims do have a right to become Indian citizens by the 1955 act, of course. The CAA allows Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, Jains and Parsis and Sikhs to become citizens after six years of living in India. These are persecuted religious minorities.  There are many things wrong with our motion today, but I’ll just give you four: Rohingyas, Tamils, police violence and the National Register of Citizens. Rohingyas are a religious Muslim minority leaving Myanmar for Bangladesh. When they come from Bangladesh to India they become economic migrants because they’re coming from a majority Muslim state. Violence and brutality of the police: let me inform you that 57 policemen had bullet wounds in a demonstration in Lucknow. Tamils are an ethnic minority, not a religious minority. The National Register of Citizens is not even mentioned in the CAA. Are we saying that India, or any other country for that matter, is not allowed to document the people living inside its boundaries?  The CAA is in front of the Supreme Court and thus should be considered sub judice. The real reason for this motion has come before us: the India-EU summit.

As you know, the Croatian Presidency is particularly sensitive to the situation in the eastern Mediterranean, which has a direct impact on the flow of migrants in the whole of south-eastern Europe and even further. We are closely monitoring the events on the migration routes and we will continue to do so throughout our Presidency. The situation on the Greek islands is currently very difficult. In 2019, more than 60 000 migrants arrived in Greece by sea, compared to 32 000 recorded in 2018. This represents an increase of 87% – far greater than the 9% percent increase recorded in 2017 and 2018. The number of people present on the Aegean islands increased significantly, reaching a peak of over 40 000 migrants. It is the first time since the implementation of the EU-Turkey statement that we have reached such a high number. Among them, there are several thousand children and unaccompanied minors who were accommodated in facilities which are not adapted to their needs. According to the UNHCR, around 40% of the 20 000 migrants in and around the Moria Camp are under 18 and nearly half of those are under 12 years old. Due to the high number of arrivals, the situation on the islands continues to deteriorate. The humanitarian situation requires our close follow-up, and we will continue supporting the efforts of Greece to relieve the situation. The Greek government is undertaking concrete actions to improve the situation, inter alia by increasing the number of transfers to the mainland. In 2019, more than 35 000 migrants have been transferred but, unfortunately, this has not decreased the pressure on the islands. Further actions are needed. The Greek Government has also announced a new scheme to protect unaccompanied minors reaching the country. I understand that the No Child Alone plan was designed to protect unaccompanied children from exploitation and criminality and includes commitments to swiftly create new structures to provide long-term accommodation for thousands of children. These new structures will provide housing, education, food and medical support. The plan also foresees the necessary legal services to allow accompanied minors to reunite with relatives in other Member States. We also take note of government measures to speed up and streamline asylum procedures and manage flows to Greece by improving border surveillance. Some of these measures are part of the new asylum legislation which recently entered into force in Greece. It will be important to implement the new provisions as fast as possible, including regarding the return procedures. The return rate so far has been a very low, for far too long. Returns are instrumental in keeping the numbers down on the islands and managing the flows. The plan of the Greek Government includes a target of returning 10 000 migrants by the end of 2020. This is ambitious, but it can be done, with the appropriate procedures in place and assistance from IOM, Frontex and EU Member States and through cooperation with third countries. Effective returns also require the cooperation of Turkey. In this respect, it is vital that both parties apply in good-faith all the provisions and operating procedures agreed as a result of the EU-Turkey statement. On a broader note, I would like to use the opportunity of this debate to reiterate that the Croatian Presidency intends to continue its focus on implementation with regard to the comprehensive approach to migration. We will do our part to ensure coherent action at EU level in terms of more effective control of the EU external borders, increased external actions and address internal aspects. I would like to stress that the humanitarian situation on the Greek islands is a cause of great concern. We have to work together to relieve the humanitarian situation. And let me also express here our appreciation for the work of all humanitarian partners. I will let the Commission further elaborate on the assistance and advice the EU provides to the Greek Government on this issue.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 175, "date": "2020-01-29.json", "name": "Ylva Johansson", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, honourable Members, as we are standing here, sitting here, speaking, waiting for our turn, more than 40 000 migrants are stuck in so—called hot spots on the Greek islands.  Most of them are living under conditions that are totally unacceptable. Many of them are children. I can only imagine being a mother in these hot spots, with children, being responsible for children, and living in a tent when it’s cold, there’s not enough food, with terrible conditions in many aspects, and being responsible for your own children and not being able to actually take responsibility as a mother. Or being a mother in a totally other country knowing that your teenager, your teenage boy, is alone there as unaccompanied minor.  These conditions are not acceptable, this we can’t stand having in the European Union in 2020. I am probably not the only one who keeps awake at night thinking about these people and the conditions they are living under. But, of course, nobody will be helped by me being awake at night. I’m the Commissioner and I am of course responsible for doing things, and you who are here tonight will probably ask me, quite rightly, what is the Commission doing and what more can we do? The Commission is supporting the Greek authorities with finding shelter for unaccompanied minors on the mainland. We will continue to support Greece and relocate people from the islands to new centres – new centres that will meet the minimum European standards for humanitarian intervention. We support the Greek authorities with our European funds. To mention just a few: EUR 50 million from the asylum migration and integration fund that supports up to 2 000 places in shelter for unaccompanied minors on the mainland; EUR 4.2 million for the IOM to create additional safe zones for unaccompanied minors on all the Greek islands; funds for a specific facility for vulnerable applicants called Kara Tepe on Lesbos; specific facilities also exist on Kos and Leros. We will continue to support Greece with our funds. I welcome the appointment that the Greek Government has done to appoint a national coordinator for unaccompanied minors. I think that the Greek Government shows the right emphasis on this very difficult situation, and I welcome that the Greek Government are committed to improve the living conditions for migrants, bringing them to new centres, reforming the asylum system and also starting returning those that are not eligible for international protection. We also think that additional incentives for the employment of doctors in the reception centres and identification centres is important. It is of great urgency to release unaccompanied minors from protective custody and transfer them to safe zones – zones that are suitable for long—term accommodation. Is this enough? Apparently not. We need to do more. Yesterday I met with the newly—appointed Greek Migration Minister, Notis Mitarakis. We discussed measures as to how we can help Greece more and what also the Greek Government and the Greek authorities are planning. Yesterday also, the European Asylum Support Office signed an agreement with Greece to double the staff in Greece from EASO.  The Commission will continue to show solidarity with Greece. This includes financial support of over EUR 2.2 billion. But the Commission alone cannot do everything. We also need the support from the Member States. We are lacking a common European asylum and migration system. In lack of that, we need voluntary support from other Member States. Greece has asked for the relocation of unaccompanied minors and I strongly support this. I support all solidarity efforts between Member States, especially when it comes to children. I call on Member States to continue to help Greece, to continue voluntary relocations and we, the Commission, will do the financial support. We will continue to work closely with the Greek authorities to help facilitate all voluntary solidarity efforts by other Member States.  I call on Member States to speed up the necessary procedures to reunify children with their families as soon as possible. Honourable Members, we talk about migration policy and the migration situation in Europe. It’s clear that even though we can see an increase of migrants arriving in Greece and especially at the Greek islands the overall situation is not a crisis. We have seen fewer irregular arrivals in the European Union than for many years. We are not in crisis; we do not have a migration crisis in Europe. But there are at least 40 000 individuals on the Greek islands and they are in crisis.  We need to support them and the most effective thing that we must do is to find a common solution that can unite Member States and Parliament in a new pact for migration and asylum. Every week, every month that we are not able to find this new common policy means these people paying too high a price.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 176, "date": "2020-01-29.json", "name": "Elissavet VOZEMBERG-VRIONIDI", "mepid": "125065", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Group. Commissioner, once again we see a failure in the effective management of migration. Desperate people arrive daily in Greece from Turkey, through traffickers, and the situation is now dramatic. The islands are destroyed and the hinterland is unable to hold such a large crowd. Unaccompanied minors exceeded 5,000, and the country's capacity today is not enough to cover half of them.  The Greek Government requested assistance from the Member States, and only France, Portugal, Bulgaria and the Czech Republic responded positively. For family reunifications there is a great problem due to excessive requirements but also contradictory laws invoked by the Member States. In Greece we are experiencing a harsh humanitarian crisis and we feel we are alone. Only five countries have the European family? How do we demonstrate practical solidarity when, even in the drama of underage children, they turn their backs? The Greek government is implementing a new migration policy and, especially for children, the Prime Minister announced a \"no child only\" initiative aimed at severely punishing traffickers and completing 4,000 shelters for unaccompanied minors. But it is not possible to manage it without help. Greeks' distrust of Europe's values is growing, and not unfairly.  Turkey continues its illegal policy against us by exploiting human souls, and the vast majority of Member States do not care. This is not how the situation can go on. We're sounding the alarm. Migration is already seriously shaking the foundations of the European Union. You know that delays in new actions are intensifying tension. I will not tire of saying this: we must all, without exceptions, take responsibility now. Greece does not ask for privileges. She's exercising her rights. Colleagues, today we said goodbye with regret to the United Kingdom and we hope that no one else will follow.

We have many refugee hotspots around the world, but this is the problem: they exist within the European Union, and they are afflicting – as we heard from the last speaker – Greece in particular. She and the Commissioner explained what the elephant in the room was: Member State coordination is lacking.  We are asking today for the Commission to act: this, for my group, is really the most important thing. I’ve been to the islands many times – other speakers will speak of this – and we need action, and the Commissioner prefaced this in the details that she gave. So, for my group, that is not to talk again about all the chronic and severe problems of under—staffing in the hotspots – the risks for children under Dublin, and so on – but to say that we need to act on long—term reception capacities on the mainland in the overcrowded hotspots, to deploy additional expert staff, and to provide crucial legal information to end the regime of geographical restrictions. So we ask the Commission to do everything it can, but of course the Member States must do more: this is really the elephant at the room. If we don’t have this combined comprehensive approach, we will continue to have these – as the Commissioner said – unacceptable conditions within the European Union.  Commissioner, this is my last speech after 20 years and six months (remember the six months!), and for much of that time I have spoken about these issues: humanitarian issues and issues of asylum. I’ve been to the Greek islands many times, and I know that these issues affect the European Union disproportionately for what they are, because they define the values of the European Union. So I really urge colleagues to do everything they can to ensure that we solve this problem, because it affects the very values of the European Union: we send a message to the world about what kind of European Union we are.

When I see the pictures, I actually see mainly suffering, I see coldness, I see lack of perspective and increasingly also violence. And it makes me sad that this is not the first winter, but the fourth winter in which people have to spend the winter there in unheated tents. I must also say that when people suffer, politics must act. It is good that we are talking here, but in order to act at last, perhaps we do not even need a new Commission asylum pact, but actually only the will of the Member States to respect human dignity and the rule of law to work for it. Without this will, if it does not become visible now, the Commission's new asylum pact is also doomed to failure. We can and will also argue here about asylum policy, we will have different opinions and discuss it. But if our Member States do not even save children who hibernate in the mud, how are we supposed to save European asylum policy? I think that, given the conditions on the Greek islands, it would be right for at least individual Member States to go ahead and send a signal and first evacuate the children from the Greek islands. Because I think that for years we have simply failed for too long because of our own demands. We shut ourselves off and believe that we will be better off.

The European Union is unaware that the Greeks are close to becoming a minority in Greece, and that the locals, not only on the islands but also throughout the country, stand helpless and look at their property, their families and the places in which they grew up being destroyed and threatened by illegal immigration. Will the European Union do something about this crisis or will it always thank Greece for standing in solidarity with its own invaders? Since we have come to the point of discussing the reunification of the families of illegal immigrants, I want to say one more thing: In recent years, due to the economic crisis, almost half a million young Greeks of my generation, who had finished a University, like me, but could not find work in Greece, have left my country and their families. These people now meet their parents and relatives for only a few days a year.

The humanitarian situation on the Greek islands is undoubtedly dramatic. We see increasing arrivals every day, and the uncertain situation around us leaves little hope for relaxation. However, if we blame Greece alone for the situation, it has fallen short for two reasons. Firstly, many bottlenecks are mainly the result of years of failure. The new Greek government has now moved forward here and has carried out evacuations to the mainland, including the 'No child alone' initiative, which has already been mentioned several times today. At the same time, Greece is also raising the issue of the long process – one reason why more and more people are stranded and stranded on the islands. At this point, perhaps a brief remark: it is not helpful if, on the one hand, we criticise Greece for too long procedures and, on the other hand, we also attack any new proposals for speeding up at the same time. This is not in the interests of the people on the islands. What is clear is that Greece's government remains in charge. It is also clear, however, that, secondly, all the other Member States are also obliged to do so. Asylum and migration policy only works through the \"and\".

Greece is undertaking concrete action to improve the situation and manage migration, but this is certainly not a matter for just one Member State, just as enhanced, irregular migratory pressures on the only land route to the European Union are not a matter for just one Member State.

We can’t continue like this, and I understand that we all agree on this. But as I said earlier, lying awake at night will not help anything. We are politicians, we need to act, and I, as the new Commissioner, have a special responsibility to act, of course. So the Commission will, of course, continue to help and support Greece. We have in the last one and a half years spent EUR 35 million to help unaccompanied minors with hotels, with guardians, and we are doing a lot of things, as I also said in my first intervention. But, as many of you have mentioned, we have been in this situation for many years. And at the same time we have, for many years, been in a politically-stuck situation, unable to take the necessary political decisions for a decent way to manage European migration in an orderly way and to have a decent way for solidarity that shows that we all know that we have different geographical realities. Those Member States that are under pressure – for example, these people living on the islands – we need to show solidarity towards the migrants but also, of course, to the Greek people, who are now paying also a very high price. Therefore, of course, first continue to support the migrants and especially the Greek Government and the Greek authorities to change these conditions. But I also think it’s very urgent to find a political solution so that we can actually come together and find this necessary common migration and asylum policy for the European Union. We can’t continue being in a stuck situation. Those who pay the price for this are the people that live under these terrible circumstances on the islands. So there is high pressure on me personally but also on Member States, and I count on your support from Parliament to find these political solutions.

I would also like to welcome your choice to put sustainability at the centre of this debate, as it perfectly mirrors our common ambitions. As we look to the future, and in line with President von der Leyen’s political guidelines, our policy actions will, on the one hand, be guided by the ambition of the European Green Deal to ensure that transport makes its important contribution to climate neutrality by 2050 and, on the other, by a Europe that is fit for the digital age when it comes to harnessing digital technologies to make mobility smart as well as sustainable.  The strategy on sustainable and smart mobility will have these two objectives at its heart and will guide us towards a transport sector that is fit for a clean, digital and modern economy. The Commission will adopt the strategy later this year, once we have completed our preparatory work, including the public consultation, and received feedback from the stakeholders. What is certain is that the strategy must include ambitious measures aimed at significantly reducing CO2 and pollutant emissions across all modes. It will exploit digitalisation and automation, enhancing connectivity to the next level, and – last but not least – it will ensure safety and accessibility.  Our comprehensive strategy for sustainable and smart mobility will have to be unprecedented in ambition to achieve a 90% reduction in emissions by 2050. I want to share what I see as the four principles that will guide transport’s contribution to the European Green Deal. First: making the transport system as a whole more sustainable, making sustainable alternative solutions available to all citizens and businesses, respecting the polluters-pay principle in all transport mode and, not in the last, fostering connectivity and access to transport for all.  Therefore, in the upcoming transport strategy, I am planning to put forward measures in the following four areas of action. First, to boost the uptake of clean vehicles and alternative fuels for road, maritime and aviation. In this regard, we are already looking into specific initiatives to ensure the availability of marine alternative fuels and sustainable aviation fuels, Second, increase the share of more sustainable transport modes, such as rail and inland waterways, and improving efficiency across the whole transport system. Thirdly, incentivising the right consumer choices and low—emissions practices. Fourth, investing in low-and zero-emissions solutions, including infrastructure.  On the road to a climate-neutral Europe by 2050, it is essential that sustainable and smart go hand—in—hand. Digitalisation is not simply a means to an end. We must take full advantage of the opportunities presented to us by digitalisation and automation, for instance, by increasing traffic efficiency through artificial intelligence or reducing traffic hazards to a minimum, to name only a few. They are the key to cleaner, simpler, smart and safe mobility across all transport modes. Digitalisation also opens the door to mobility as a service and the seamless combination of transport modes for a single journey, encouraging more people out of private cars and onto shared and more efficient forms of transport. We will, of course, be vigilant and watch out for any impact on jobs and skills.  To make this happen, we need accessibility, affordability, connectivity. I am 100% committed to leaving nobody behind as we embark on this green and digital transformation. The Just Transition Mechanism will be key here: it will mobilise EUR 100 billion to address the social and economic effects of the green transition, focusing on the region’s industries and workers who will face the greatest challenges. The connectivity provided by transport is fundamental to freedom of movement in the European Union.  Safety and security: it should go without saying that, while we must embark on a significant reduction of emissions from transport and harness digital opportunities for the sector, safety and security will continue to come first. Our strategy will incorporate measures for maintaining the highest safety and security standards in the world of transport.  When you talk about global leadership, a real market for the green digital solution is emerging, and I want the EU to be a global leader in these areas: from block chain and digital mapping and tracking, to connected and automated vehicles, trains, planes and vessels. To secure our position at global level, we need to take investment in research and innovation very seriously, and we need to work closely with the industry. This are some of my initial remarks on your questions, and of course I am looking forward to your questions and comments.

Thank you also for what you said you would do this year, and i thank you, at the same time, for introducing many important dossiers for transport policy in the Commission programme in the future. It was a very pleasant surprise for me. Future transport policy must first and foremost ensure much-needed mobility and connectivity for the development of the economy. All the measures we must take in the future must, first of all, ensure mobility and then comply with and, of course, the requirements of the Ecological Pact.  There are things you can do without having a lot of costs, not necessarily some market measures, and I can give you some examples. For example, for rail transport, you have freight corridors, which are not developed at the level that should be. You must apply the existing regulation and, at the same time, ensure harmonisation of all regulations and standardisation in this very important mode of transport, because it requires transfer from road to rail.

These are the irresponsible statements that the Vice-President of the Spanish Government made yesterday in an interview. An unfortunate anti-aircraft rhetoric that what it does is pretend to question the citizens who make use of the plane to move simply and simply, and are questioned simply for being free. Speeches like this, which we do not share at all, what they do is search, blame and criminalize not only the industry, but also all those who use certain goods or services simply because they are free and have the ability to choose.  The criminalization of transport not only ruins truckers or pilots, but also leads to direct bankruptcy of foreign trade, our exports, domestic trade and, of course, the island regions. I come from some islands, from the Balearic Islands, and we need safe, reliable, fast transport, in this case, as is that of airplanes. And we do it either out of necessity or because we want to. Just because we're free citizens. Today more than ever, from the European institutions we need to move away from populismos, and that transport is not seen as a threat but as an opportunity; I'm not going to say it as a necessity anymore.

First, the aviation sector: it is high time it entered the ETS (ETS) system. And let's go further to implement a real kerosene tax.

Secondly, there is no European strategy aimed not at the connectivity of all Member States, but above all of island and remote regions. The situation is dramatic. Already today the costs borne by these populations are enormous. All they are asking for is equal conditions and opportunities with other Europeans. Thirdly, a socially just transition.

Yes, we must ensure that we have this special attention for business and for employment in the strategy that will be carried out with the help of digital technology.

This is a democratic issue for Europe: Commissioner, you have a very important role to play in this area, to ensure that every citizen tomorrow has mobility solutions close to home, close to home, close to work.

For this reason, the European Union must support effective recognition of territorial continuity with regard to air transport and finance the investment in the construction of the bridge over the Straits of Messina as a necessary and indispensable infrastructure for the rail link within the Ten-T European corridor.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 250, "date": "2020-01-29.json", "name": "Henna VIRKKUNEN", "mepid": "124726", "text": "   – Madam President, when we are speaking about the Green Deal, I think that the decarbonisation of transport will be one of the biggest challenges.

We also have the possibility to invest more: very modern, smart, fast connections in the transport sector, and here I’m also asking for your support, Madame Commissioner.

We need to do our utmost to make the transition from high-emission transport to zero-emission transport, such as rail transport. Through an action plan to revive it, we need to ensure regulations to unleash the potential of the passenger and cargo strand, which will improve coordination and reduce bureaucratic setbacks.

I have carefully noted them and am very much encouraged by your interest in the subject. I do recognise what you are saying on all the ideas. We are working on them in the Commission in order to put forward this strategy by the end of the year. All the points are valid. And, as I said at the beginning, for this strategy to be successful we need to have everyone on board. So it needs to be just, and it needs to how create new jobs, it has to be accepted. And this will be part of our thinking. Listening to you all, it also becomes very clear that there are baskets of measures for each mode. There is not merely one solution for everything, and we have to carefully blend and balance several measures in order to achieve smoothly the best possible outcome in the short term. Because people are expecting to see results rather quickly from our work on the sustainability of transport. Many of you stressed the importance of the TEN-T infrastructure. And I can only say that I share this view, where it is needed, because it is incomplete, be it for various modes of cross-border interconnection. We know that we need to do more there in order to help create the missing links, which are not necessarily economically sustainable. And this would be the role of the European Union to add and support the missing links. And why not eliminate the barriers, which are cross-border, in order to make flows easier? The Commission announced – or at least I’m telling you – that we’re are going to revise the TEM-T infrastructure in 2021. Many Members mentioned alternative fuels infrastructure and alternative fuels as such. I think this is also very much in connection with aviation, which was intensely mentioned. We have to keep in mind that both aviation and maritime transport are global businesses. Once more, we need to understand there are baskets of measures, there are technological advances and there are alternative fuels. We need to very carefully look into them and into the market and the volume of this kind of fuels on the market, so that they could have an important uptake. But these are all things we are looking at. A lot of you talked about implementation. Of course it is all for nothing if we adopt legislation which is not implemented in the end. So many countries are very late in implementing important things in regulation. We could mention railway signalling as just one example. Many Members mentioned the fact that there are files which are blocked by the Council. I hope I can assure you that, for example, the single European sky is something I’m trying to lobby for and promote in each meeting I have with any representative of the Member States. We have it on the table and we’d like very much to see it moved forward by the Croatian presidency. This is something I’m insisting on, and I really hope we will have movement here. The same is true with the Eurovignette, we haven’t withdrawn the Eurovignette, we are trying to lobby for it in order to benefit from all the good work done. We have to push forward so that the Council will have a general approach – hopefully – by June. Because the Eurovignette or the single European sky are the kind of things which will make a difference in road transport or improving the efficiency of air traffic. And this will have a concrete impact on sustainability and on the reduction of emissions or on internalising the externalities in road transport. Road  safety was mentioned. Of course, road safety has to be at the core of our activity. And what we are going to propose, or work on, is a safe system, which is an integrated approach towards safety in transport. Because, as was mentioned by several people here, there are so many elements which together constitute the environment for safety in transport. All this needs to be taken into account.  All the ideas I heard are very good. And the last word would be on the fact that all the industries in connection with transport as such are the backbone of our economy. We need to make it more sustainable and smart, but keep in mind that it is competitive and it has to remain as such. And for this industry – as it was mentioned – we need measures which are predictable so people will know, investors will know, what it coming  so they can plan in advance for 10 or 20 years.  I also had some particular questions from Mr Schulze on low-emission zones or the harmonising of vignette systems. This is something we are working on. Because the idea of having low-emission zones is good. Yes it is, but it is true that for people moving around not knowing the system is a deterrent or an obstacle. So what we are looking at is to propose a harmonisation of these systems for urban areas. For the Eurovignette, we have already said that we would like to support the Eurovignette.  The question on inland waterways raised by Mr Băsescu: inland waterways need to become the new big thing because I think they are underused. You are absolutely right, because inland waterways together with transport with rail are the most sustainable modes we have. And new progress on inland waterways is needed in terms of sustainability of the ports and the vessels and new intelligent traffic systems. All these are there, we are looking into them. And you are right that the Danube Commission, which is 70 years old – or something similar, you know would know better – has a different regulation. But I promise you, we are going to look into harmonisation. I think because they are non-EU members it is not easy but it is absolutely needed. So thank you very much for the suggestion. So this would be, honourable Members, in a nutshell, my reaction to your comments. I trust that you will get involved in the work on such a sustainable transport system for the future. And, Madam President, consider this my invitation to you to contribute to this work. So thank you very much and I hope will have new occasions to go more in depth on each of the subjects touched upon this evening.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ALDE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 262, "date": "2020-01-29.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "  The debate is closed.

In this context, I would particularly stress the urgency of the EU's efforts to strengthen the development of quality public transport (urban, long-distance and international), which should be particularly affordable and physically accessible to every resident in the EU, in particular people with disabilities and those living in more peripheral areas.

Regulation is really a subspecies of central planning.  What shocks me is how Europe has developed economically: it is truly status, where only large multinationals thrive due to crony capitalism. Its attitude to business in general, start—ups, innovation in the sciences and technology and the sheer scale of regulation have been anti-competitive, anti-growth and job-destroying.
