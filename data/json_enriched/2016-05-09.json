With this report, we have tried to find another focus in cohesion policy and increase its added value with a new approach to one of Europe's most significant treasures, the mountains. The mountains, which represent about 30% of the territory of the European Union and nearly 17% of citizens. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues from all political groups for our excellent collaboration with which we have come to this balanced text.  What have we achieved in this document? Our idea of the need to create a programme for the development of mountain regions is common. A European approach can contribute greatly to their convergence, precisely if their advantages and disadvantages as a separate territory are taken into account. This programme could eventually grow into a strategy for the mountains of Europe, which is part of cohesion policy.  Secondly, we advocate the revision and coordination of the instruments existing at European level, which are relevant for the mountains and for the future betting of the mountain dimension in the regional as well as in other Policies of the European Union. Many of the Union's programmes, policies and instruments play a serious indirect role in the mountains and the results they achieve can be increased if the mountain dimension is seriously affected in them.  Thirdly, it is good to have the mountains planned in the next programming period after the creation of a European definition and its placement in the next regulation. Defining the mountains of Europe is a difficult task and many similar definitions exist even in European documents. But in the common agricultural policy, for placing particular emphasis on mountain farming, the definition of mountains is enshrined in the regulation itself – something that is also needed in cohesion policy. Why is such a policy needed? First, the mountains have certain specificities caused by difficult accessibility and vulnerability to climate change. At the same time, they also have numerous riches and real potential for development.  The report therefore focuses on environmental protection and the fight against climate change. This is most important for all mountains in Europe, as it has an effect on tourism and agriculture in many of them.  The mountains are an excellent source of all types of renewable energy – wind, solar, water and biomass. They provide an excellent opportunity to develop the EU's renewable energy policy, which can be concentrated in mountainous regions.  The economy of the mountains still depends largely on crafts, tourism and agriculture. We call for support for small and medium-sized enterprises with a separate approach to mountain regions, precisely to take into account both these and other specificities.  All this politics goes through the education that has its specifics. During the preparation of my report, I saw a number of cases where dual education leads to good results, as in the mountains there is also a need for concentration on crafts and training – especially in sectors that do not lead to environmental pollution.  Last but not least, accessibility and connectivity are also important. The links between the mountains and their adjacent areas are key, as is our proposal for definition.  High-quality internet is key because without it we cannot facilitate the creation of small and medium-sized enterprises and the development of the economy of mountain regions. Attracting so-called \"independent professionals\", that is, people whose place of work is not fixed, is a very realistic way to improve the demographic situation.  Dear colleagues, I will stop there, wait for your suggestions. I hope we learn a lot of ideas tonight and realize them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 20, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Ruža TOMAŠIĆ", "mepid": "119431", "text": "   Rapporteur. – Madam President, more and more people are living in fear that modernization and development will destroy their traditions and way of life. Their regions are largely passive, with a smaller and less young population that should be the carrier of development, so they consider new development strategies foreign, misfits and often imposed. Our responsibility to these people is great. We must not allow them to live in fear and be mere observers of development processes, but we must include them to the maximum. This report strongly supports a bottom-up approach and the involvement of local stakeholders from the earliest stages of developing development strategies, and we call on the Commission to provide Guidance to Member States on how to address trust and administrative barriers between different levels of governance. In places with limited resources and capacities and as such can hardly bear the administrative burden of these development tools, the Commission and the Member States must provide additional support, in particular in the form of training and consultation. Experience suggests that the biggest challenges in front of local stakeholders are financial and administrative in nature. Effective integration of funds needs to be worked on to make European funds more accessible and smarter, and we welcome the establishment of a group of independent experts to monitor simplification procedures for beneficiaries of the ESI Funds. We must also combat over-regulation practices that create unnecessary requirements and barriers at all levels, resulting in greater financial and administrative burdens for users. We want as many partners as possible to propose CLLD strategies before 31 December 2017 when the deadline for submission of proposals expires. Until then, we need to achieve greater awareness, ensure the capacity of local stakeholders is strengthened and active participation of social and economic partners and civil society. In this context, it is particularly worrying that for some Member States CLLD represents a mere fulfilment of bureaucratic formalities rather than a true bottom-up approach. Parliament recognises the successes of local action groups in project management and calls for more comprehensive funding and expansion of their scope. We welcome the participation of different partners in the work of LAMs, but only with the quality application of the existing legislative framework according to which it is not possible for one of the interest groups to have more than 49% of the voting rights, thereby reducing the possibility of favouring a single interest group or conflict of interest. Community-led local development can be a major catalyst for employment, especially for young people, through the involvement of SMEs in the implementation of local development projects. Given that unemployment among young people in several Member States is still very high, we consider it a priority for local and regional authorities to provide preconditions for the employment of young people through tax and other incentives. In implementing the ITI, it is also possible to achieve greater involvement of local partners, and the tool itself should not be limited to urban areas. Parliament believes that CLLD and ITI must play an even more important role in future cohesion policy and calls for a bottom-up approach to become an integral part of ITI.", "language": "en", "original_language": "hr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 21, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Iskra MIHAYLOVA", "mepid": "125128", "text": "   Author. – Madam President, Commissioner, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, I present an oral question and a draft resolution under the common name 'Speeding up the implementation of cohesion policy'. The oral question is directly related to the two reports previously submitted and is relevant to the implementation of cohesion policy throughout the planning period.  It has been more than two years since the start of the current cohesion policy programming period and we are already reporting serious delays in its implementation. There have been delays in the adoption of operational programmes, delays in the implementation and implementation of a significant number of ex ante conditionalities fixed in member states' partnership agreements, delays in the appointment of the competent programme and certification bodies by the Member States.  Therefore, in general, we can find a delay in the start of implementation of the programmes, as well as in the preparation and submission of payment documents. There is also a high risk of serious losses by cancelling commitments after 2017 under the M+3 rule.  In recent years, the European Parliament has often called on the European Commission to respond appropriately to the problem of delaying the implementation of cohesion policy. An example of this was the debates on the sixth cohesion report held in this Chamber.  In this context, we have repeatedly stressed the crucial importance of simplifying policy, good governance and coordination and creating synergies with other policies and their financial instruments.  Members of the European Parliament welcomed the establishment of a working group to better implement the 2007-2013 programmes in eight Member States, as well as the establishment by the Commission of a high-level group of independent experts on simplification. Nevertheless, most of the efforts mentioned so far are necessary to overcome the serious challenges of the European Union's cohesion policy.  The European Parliament invites the European Commission to carry out a detailed assessment of progress in the implementation of cohesion policy, to prepare an in-depth analysis of the risks to financial losses by Member States in the event of cancellation of commitments, indicating the specific amounts by country, as well as an analysis of payment forecasts according to the documents submitted by the Member States.  For these reasons, and on behalf of the Committee on Regional Development, I would like to ask the European Commission what specific measures it has taken and will take to prevent losses in cancelling commitments. What measures does it take and will take to ensure the full implementation of the payment plan within the 2016 budget and also for the coming years of the planning period? What measures has it taken and what will it take to improve administrative capacity at all levels for the implementation of cohesion policy? Last but not least: how will the European Commission encourage the implementation of the appropriate structural reforms necessary for the effective implementation of cohesion policy? Finally, I would like to ask the Commission what will be the focus of the group's work on better implementation of the programmes for the 2014-2020 programming period?  The European Parliament calls on the European Commission, through the decisions of the Committee on Regional Development, to answer these questions and to provide Parliament with a comprehensive assessment of the situation and the solutions envisaged in order to effectively implement the Cohesion Policy of the European Union, and in order to open a debate on the future of cohesion policy, building on the experience gained in addressing the challenges of this period.", "language": "en", "original_language": "bg", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 22, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, regarding cohesion policy in mountainous regions, the Commission welcomes Ms Iotova’s report and notes the call for cohesion policy to address the specific challenges faced by mountainous regions. The European Structural and Investment Funds (ESIF) have a long tradition of supporting regions with specific geographical features, which includes mountain regions. The ESIF Regulation already provides several possibilities to take account of the situation of mountainous regions, such as the modulation of co-financing rates and the use of the new territorial tools, that is: community-led local development and integrated territorial investments.  The ESIF support programmes and strategies specifically targeting mountainous regions have introduced tools for integrated strategies, such as the EU macro-regional strategy for the Alpine Region. The Commission will ask in its monitoring and review meetings with the Member States how they address the specific situation of mountain regions and how the possibilities offered by the ESIF Regulations have been taken up. It is therefore important to make the most of what the current Regulation has to offer, such as the new territorial development tools which I have just mentioned. Regarding the new territorial development tools in cohesion policy: as underlined in Ms Tomašić’s report, integrated territorial investment and community-led local development are decisive for the involvement of local and regional actors. The Commission strongly believes that the introduction of these new territorial tools has been a significant step forward in promoting an integrated place-based approach to territorial development.  I would like to underline that a significant amount of guidance has been provided to Member States and to local actors, both on integrated territorial investment and on community-led local development, to promote the use of these tools. The Commission will continue its strong efforts to share information and share best practices, both with Member States as well as with local actors. These efforts translate the Commission’s willingness to assist Member States in ensuring quality implementation of cohesion policy. Finally, regarding the oral question. With a budget of more than EUR 450 billion and over EUR 215 billion for cohesion policy for 2014-2020, the European Structural and Investment Funds are Europe’s main investment policy tools. To maximise their impact, a reformed cohesion policy framework was advocated and adopted in agreement with the Member States. This framework puts the emphasis on the results, which concentrated funding on priority teams and areas, and investments based on good strategic planning.  The reformed cohesion policy requires good quality implementation subsequent to proper programming, planning and preparatory work. Due to considerable joint efforts with Member States, the Commission adopted half of the cohesion policy programmes already in the course of 2014, in spite of delays in adoption of the regulatory framework. However, under shared management, actual implementation of the programmes is the responsibility of the Member States. The Commission notes that designations of programme authorities took place for less than one quarter of programmes. Furthermore, the number of payment claims received is still low.  Member States are strongly encouraged to continue and to intensify their efforts and there is scope for political pressure in this regard. The Commission provided targeted assistance for eight Member States covered under the Task Force for Better Implementation initiative, reducing significantly the risk of decommitment of funds at closure for the 2007—2013 period to below EUR 5 billion, just over one per cent. The targeted approach, centred on Member States and programmes at risk of implementation, continues in 2014-2020, and that includes closure-related tasks.  Our starting point for discussions with Member States on the funding priorities was rooted in three pillars: the Europe 2020 targets; the relevant country-specific recommendations; and the socio-economic analysis at Member State and regional level. In the coming years, future country-specific recommendations may trigger, where relevant, ESIF programme adjustments. These can also be triggered at the initiative of the Commission, ensuring the Commission’s support for structural reforms in Member States. Regarding administrative capacity, to which the 2014-2020 Regulations have dedicated a thematic objective with a specific allocation, the Commission will continue to assist Member States, including through the newly-established structural reform support service, in carrying out structural reforms in line with the European Semester process and the country-specific recommendations.  Furthermore, Member States can speed up implementation without losing the quality of the spending by using the expanded range of simplified cost options in the 2014-2020 regulatory framework. The reduction in administrative burden this brings about will ensure a more rapid reimbursement of funds, with a greater focus on the results and a lower risk of errors as compared to reimbursement on the basis of real costs.  Regarding automatic decommitment of funds in the third year following commitment, this should be less of a concern in 2014-2020. According to current assumptions, no significant decommitments are expected in this period. This is due to the generic application of the three-year rule instead of the two-year rule across all Member States and to the annual refinancing payments made to the Member States. Nevertheless, timely implementation of the cohesion policy allocation is crucial to avoid an accumulation of payment applications towards the end of the programming period and, first and foremost, to ensure that programmes deliver results on the ground as early as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 23, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Michaela ŠOJDROVÁ", "mepid": "124710", "text": "   rapporteur for the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs. – Madam President, the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has been adopted on the report on the new territorial development instruments.

That is why such a joint debate is, I think, very important – not only for us, but also for the region and for the people who can benefit from the fact that there is European cohesion policy. Parliament had strongly supported the introduction of these new instruments, but also pushed for the financial instruments to be pushed. For urban contexts in particular, the Integrated Territorial Investment System or the Community Led Local Development Instrument – known as the Leader now, also available for the ERDF, for Regional Fund – are very important new instruments for the region to be a little closer to the citizens and to make a bit of efficient and success-oriented cohesion policy.  However, i have the impression, in the first few years, that the commission's many new guidelines, in particular, have made the whole procedure worse than it would have actually been made usable. We had simplification in mind and today we need to think again about how we can simplify and make the whole cohesion policy easier for the user and for the user. I think one point will be that we need to do more training for the people who use it.

Firstly, there needs to be a simplification, particularly in access to European funding for the final beneficiaries, since you know that the complexity means that many beneficiaries are discouraged, and this also feeds the growing disaffection for the European Union. Secondly, we will have to think about excluding from the calculation of national deficits the investments made to co-finance cohesion policy, and in particular those implemented in the resolution of the migration challenge and for the integration of refugees.

As the Commissioner put it in a nutshell, cohesion policy is the European Union's main investment tool. As shadow rapporteur for the report 'Cohesion policy in mountain areas', I would like to thank Mrs Iotova very much for her work. It is important for the EU to find new ways of better supporting mountain regions. And there are some levers, particularly on the part of cohesion policy, that can be better used.  We know that there can be no one-size-fits-all model that can be applied anywhere. But I think mountainous regions all face similar challenges – be it climate change, or people's access to public services, educational institutions, the labour market. The role of women and the situation of women in mountainous regions of my group, the Greens, are particularly important here. Women, especially in mountainous regions, have lower employment opportunities and a lower employment rate compared to men and are less integrated into traditional sectors of the economy. And when they are employed, as the studies from these regions show, they are either part-time or in low-paid jobs. I believe that we, as Members of the European Parliament, must take up this challenge in particular.  There is, for example, a very good project, which we would also like to mention, an Internet project called WOMEN-ALPnet, which explicitly aims to promote the participation of women in sustainable development in the Alpine region. We are also pleased that the report takes particular account of the role of glaciers and the role of the mountains as eco- and water systems. According to calculations, the glaciers in Europe are expected to have melted down by 2050. The EU must counteract this fatal development: I think we are much more dependent on our ecosystems than many people think; it is our task to preserve them.  So there are some very positive points in the report. However, we will also ask for two split or separate votes in the vote, especially as far as the wording is concerned. In the report, the mountains are sometimes described as an obstacle through which it is essential to build roads or other transport links. We Greens naturally take a different view here: mountains are primarily vulnerable ecosystems for us, in which any construction project – especially in the area of infrastructure – can cause massive damage. Man should adapt to the mountain and not the other way around.  We will ask for a second split vote in the formulation that solar and wind turbines could affect the landscape. We Greens, too, naturally see this differently. In any case, we must ensure that – and this is also included in this report – mountains are not misused as material storage facilities for the surrounding regions, but are perceived and supported as fragile ecosystems that have a major impact on our well-being.

They are essential for achieving the objectives of cohesion policy.

And no one better than local authorities will be able to indicate the territorial objectives of their communities, in a logic of national understanding, thus carrying out european cohesion policy. This requires the definition of strategies in the first stages of the implementation process with regional and local actors, in particular at the level of specific and specialised training, technical and financial support resulting from an effective partnership between the regions or Member States and the European Union. Hence the importance of cooperation between local, regional, national and European authorities to ensure the consecration of technical assistance budgets for local authorities, thus avoiding duplication of existing structures. We are talking about the empowerment of regional and local structures as being fundamental to the full implementation of the policy of economic, social and territorial cohesion, which should, in our view, pay particular attention to projects committed to adapting localities and regions to the new demographic reality and in countering the resulting imbalances.

In the Hautes-Alpes, for example, where employment is primarily seasonal, livestock farming rubs shoulders with arboreal crops - I am thinking of apples - two sectors, therefore, with totally different needs. The diversity of mountain cultures and their richness, this is what makes them unique.  The French Alpine region therefore seems to me to be a laboratory for the agriculture of tomorrow. The farms are medium-sized or even small, specialized but focused on the local market and short circuits, far from your intensive agriculture projects to conquer international markets.  Regional farmers, on the other hand, seek to value their products. There are many appellations of controlled origin, which explains the development of organic farming and short-circuit marketing, which generates more than half of the turnover. The number of farms in these regions has fallen by 28% while the average farm area has increased by 10%: again, we find the result of a CAP that pushes concentration.

A lot of novelties have been introduced, from the thematic concentration to the focus on results, the need for greater coordination, especially with the economic policy of ex-ante preconditions and everything else. The news means improvements, but they are also looking for new knowledge, additional work on preparations. Countries should have programmed differently and applied the new approach, established new governance structures, new procedures, new information systems. All this has led to the situation that in 2016 in the third year of perspective 2014-2020, implementation in most is just beginning and the risk of decommitment occurs. I heard Commissioner Vella say that because n+3 the risk of decommitment is lower because we previously had an n+2 rule, however, the question is whether states really have an n+3 rule since the advance is much lower than the earlier perspective and that the operational programs were adopted too late, and the ex-ante requirements have not yet been met. With this resolution, we do not want to blame anyone or look for the culprit for the late start of implementation and the risk of loss of funds. We are not asking for any more funds or extension of the n+3 rules. We are looking for the following: accelerated simplification of rules and procedures, approaching the needs of end-users, more communication to increase the visibility of cohesion policy among citizens, early start of programming so that the system is ready to start implementing in practice in the first year of perspective, not just theoretically in regulation. The first message is that we are looking for policy stability. We cannot expect early implementation if for each perspective we introduce completely new rules for programming and implementation of a new governance structure, new procedures, new information systems. Another message is that Member States must work to improve financial management systems, address problems that are an obstacle to the preparation and implementation of projects, and are often deeply structural in the Member States themsies themsies and therefore carry out structural reforms, become faster and more flexible and strengthen administrative capacities. In addition, the resolution seeks a greater role for national parliaments and stronger coordination and communication between us, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Member States.

We are in Strasbourg, the bi-location of the Parliament, being one of the many ways in which the EU shamelessly wastes money. But this is not just about money: this is about propaganda.

What we do have is mountains of debt; what we do have are peaks of demand for people to go to doctors’ surgeries; and what we do have are valleys of despair of people in our region who cannot get into work, who cannot get to see a doctor and who cannot get their kids into the right school. We have all of these things, and we can thank the EU and its cohesion policy for much of it, because the reasons why we cannot have these things is because our industry has been destroyed – we were the home of the industrial revolution – and we are subjected to mass, uncontrolled immigration into our area, which means we do not have the places for people to go into the schools or the houses or the hospitals. So really, the only mountain that the people in the West Midlands really want to talk about is ‘Mount Freedom’. I want them to ascend to the pinnacle of ‘Mount Freedom’ on our referendum day and have a look at the view, when we can look at all of you across the Channel and say ‘Hi guys, the view is lovely, but we love it at the top, and we love it being free.’ (The speaker agreed to take a blue-card question under Rule 162(8))", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "EFDD", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 50, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Olaf STUGER", "mepid": "125028", "text": "  \"blue card\" question. – I have had the pleasure of being in the region where Mr Etheridge is from and what struck me there was the enormous - and I am sorry to have to say so - poverty.

The legal and policy framework for the European Structural and Investment Funds for 2014-2020 has entailed a major leap forward in taking account of the diversity of European regions, in particular their mountainous areas, and developing specific tools to exploit the potential of this diversity. For this new funding cycle, Member States are required to set out in their partnership agreements an integrated approach to address the specific needs of geographical areas suffering from severe and permanent handicaps. Furthermore, they have at their disposal new instruments to reflect these specificities. I have mentioned modulation of EU co-financing rates but also integrated territorial investments and community-led local development. The Commission strongly believes that the introduction of these new territorial tools will facilitate promoting an integrated place-based approach to territorial development in cohesion policy as well as to foster a bottom-up approach. But, following the adoption of the ESIF programmes, now it is up to Member States to take up these new tools and to translate our funds into to growth and jobs for European regions and European citizens. It is their responsibility, but the Commission is actively supporting them in this endeavour. We are jointly examining those programmes where particular efforts are needed. We have set up a high-level group on simplification. We are supporting administrative capacity, providing a great deal of guidance so that they can accelerate implementation without having to compromise on quality. I noted that many mentioned capacity building, and it is worth mentioning the several administrative capacity building actions proposed by the Commission in areas such as public procurement and state aid and the TAIEX-REGIO Peer 2 Peer platform designed to help officials involved in the management of the European Regional Development Fund and the Cohesion Fund to exchange knowledge and to exchange good practices. Also, the newly established structural reform support service will assist Member States in carrying out structural reforms. It was also suggested that the Commission needs to communicate its policies better such as FC and ESIF complementarities and the Commission recently published a brochure on FC and ESIF complementarities which is available on the Commission’s website as well as a technical website on the same topic. The Commission is confident that this work will bear fruit, allowing investments to result and sustainable growth for people on the ground, which is after all our common objective to us all. I can assure you the Commission will spare no energy in these efforts.

This trend is not limited only in more peripheral countries, it is not limited to countries such as Bulgaria and Romania, where entire mountain municipalities disappear. One of the scariest statistics I came across in my own country was that in a quarter of the settlements in the mountainous regions there are no children under 14. Although weaker, rich countries also see a trend of depopulation.  With the loss of mountain municipalities, not only the ecosystem services on which we all depend are lost. The rich culture of the mountains is lost, as well as excellent development opportunities. And that is why I want to address the European Commission tonight.

Nord Stream 2 is a subject of huge concern for many Members in this House, but also for Member States and in particular for the central and eastern European Member States, as was reflected in the letter of nine prime ministers and leaders addressed to President Juncker on 17 March.  The concerns are of various natures, be they legal, geopolitical or economic. As regards the legal aspect, let me reiterate what we stated in this House some weeks ago. If built, Nord Stream 2 will have to fully comply, just like any other infrastructure project, with applicable European Union law, including on energy and environment.  The construction of such an important infrastructure project as Nord Stream 2 cannot happen in a legal void. This would also run counter to the interests of economic operators in having legal certainty. Nor can it be exclusively operated only according to Russian law. Against the background of colliding legal regimes, Nord Stream 2, if built, has to be operated under a legal framework which also takes due account of the key principles of our energy market rules. While respect for these legal principles is in our view a necessary precondition, we also recognise that for the central and eastern European Member States the issues of the impact on the security of supply of the region and on the central and eastern European gas market are of particular importance. Let me remind you that most of the central and eastern European gas market remains highly dependent on a dominant gas supplier, namely Gazprom, as well as on a limited number of transport corridors.  In the last few years, the Commission’s most important objective with regard to the central and eastern European Member States has been to foster progress in making the gas market more secure, competitive and diversified, thanks to the European Union’s internal energy market infrastructure, development and competition enforcement. In this context, let me mention the Commission’s energy security strategy of May 2014, supported by European Union Member States and this Parliament, and the security of supply package originally proposed, with legislative proposals aimed at improving the security of supply of the European Union and in particular the more vulnerable regions. Regarding infrastructure development, the Commission has provided strong support to the central and eastern European Member States in terms of improving their connectivity across markets through regional groupings such as BEMIP and CESEC, improving access to LNG through building of new LNG terminals in Lithuania and Poland, while another important terminal is planned in Croatia, and promoting the development of liquid gas HAPs not only in the Mediterranean , but also in Bulgaria. We will continue our efforts together with Member States to ensure that other key diversification projects are also completed in the coming years. Nord Stream 2 will, due to its route, alter the landscape of the European Union’s gas markets, and we will have to carefully assess its impact on our own priorities in terms of security of supply, diversification and creation of competitive gas markets, including in central and eastern Europe.  Clearly, Nord Stream 2 will not give access to a new source of supply or of a supplier and further increase excess capacity from Russia to the European Union. As regards transit rules, Nord Stream 2 could lead to gas transportation corridors being decreased from three to at least two – abandoning the route through Ukraine – and the German route via Poland could also be in danger. Such a reduction of routes would not improve security of supply.  Regarding the market impact of the Nord Stream 2 project, we are carefully analysing what impact it can have on competition on our gas markets, including in central and eastern Europe. We have made a lot of progress in implementing the Third Energy Package across Europe and we have to make sure that no market operator is able to leverage its dominant position to the detriment of consumers.  Let me say at the end of my statement a few words on Ukraine. Despite economic and political challenges, Ukraine continues to be a reliable gas partner and transit country. It is in the interests of all parties, including and notably the central and eastern European countries, that Ukraine remains a significant gas transit corridor. The successful implementation of the gas winter package, with the constructive engagement of both Russia and Ukraine and facilitated by the Commission, has helped to secure domestic consumption in Ukraine and contributed to a smooth transit in supply of Russian gas to the European Union. The Commission stands ready to continue this successfully proven format and to enlarge the trilateral talks to the negotiation of a new transit contract with Russia and Ukraine as the current one comes to an end in 2019.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 78, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Jerzy BUZEK", "mepid": "28269", "text": "  On behalf of the PPE Group. – (2) Mr President, I would like to begin by Thank you, Commissioner, for a very important statement. Today is 9 May, Europe Day, a celebration of unity, understanding and cooperation. It is good that we are talking about Nord Stream II. There can be no doubt – this is apparent from all the discussions – that this project undermines European unity and solidarity, undermines trust and creates tensions between countries. Political reservations about this project also create investment uncertainty for business. As rapporteur for the Security of Gas Supply Regulation, I stress, like the Commissioner, that Nord Stream II strengthens the monopolistic position of a single supplier, challenges the principle of diversification of supply, and threatens the security of several central European countries. As such, it concerns the whole Union, not just a few countries. There are environmental concerns, including reservations about the development of the maritime economy in the Baltic Sea and commitments to Ukraine. This project should therefore not receive any support from the European Union and should be subject without exception to Eu law.

There is no doubt that we need more instruments, more infrastructure to respond more flexibly to market developments and energy consumption. However, it seems clear to me – and I agree with the things we have heard from President Buzek – that the project to double the Nord Stream gas pipeline is not going in this direction and represents a step backwards in relation to the ambitions for coordinating energy policies that the European Commission drew up just a few months ago, in February 2015, in its communication on the Energy Union, and which this Parliament amended and signed in its resolution of 15 December.  What are the elements? Firstly, Nord Stream increases its energy dependence on a single supplier, namely the Russian giant Gazprom, and creates the conditions for the exercise of a dominant position in the market. At the moment there is no need to double the Nord Stream, as the current Nord Stream 1 exercises below its capabilities. In addition, Nord Stream 2 involves almost exclusively actors from a single Member State. In other words, it is a project for the use and consumption of only certain national interests and not of the general interests of the European Union. Finally, it is a vulnus in the definition of the future European energy architecture because it is a precedent, according to which a Member State has completely free hands in deciding on the energy strategy that must involve all European countries.

Its implementation, if indeed it were to happen, would show that all these beautiful words about Europe spoken in this House have little to do with reality when it comes to the powerful but particular political and economic interests of some countries and businesses. Who can believe the assurances of the consortium planning Nord Stream that this project is purely commercial and not political, since we know very well that Russia is using gas as a political weapon to achieve its neo-imperial objectives, since we know that the capacity of existing gas pipelines to transport gas from Russia to the EU already far exceeds the Union's demand for Russian gas. This project would deepen the dependence of EU countries on Russia, and already more than a third of the gas imported by the Union comes from that country. Five Member States depend on Russia as the only external supplier of all imported gas. This investment would further deepen the divide between eastern and western Europe, and would allow Russia to easily bypass Ukraine as a transit country to the European Union, depriving Ukraine of around two billion dollars a year in transit revenue, which would perhaps destabilise Ukraine.  Yet we have devoted so many words to the democratic and economic development of this country.  The Commission acknowledges that the nord stram 2 project is economically unjustified and that it is contrary to the Union's energy objectives such as increased security of supply or diversification. So how does the Commission intend to counteract these potential negative effects? It is also clear that a gas pipeline passing through territories governed by Union law should also be subject to this law in the subsea part.

Why is it that we are creating this energy union? To create a well—functioning energy market, to attract capital, to create growth and jobs, to push the sustainable transition agenda much further – and, not least, to be less dependent on Russian gas and supplies from Mr Putin.  This leads me to the obvious question: where does Nord Stream 2 fit into this context? To me the simple answer is that it does not fit at all. I am fully aware of the fact that we will be dependent, to some degree, on Russian gas in years to come, but bear in mind that Nord Stream 1 is operating at around only half of its capacity today. Therefore I find it very hard to identify any economic, environmental or political arguments for Nord Stream 2. I find it very hard to see any positive perspectives for anyone other than Mr Putin in this.  So far, I do not think that either we, the European Parliament, or the Member States have taken Nord Stream 2 and the perspectives of this project seriously enough. More than anything, we need to conduct a firm geopolitical study on North Stream 2 and the implications of the project.

In reality, however, not only is the Northern Pipeline not a problem, but it comes in response to the Union itself's inability to achieve energy efficiency and supply while enhancing its energy security. The problem for us is that the European Union has not yet achieved its objective of diversifying sources and supply routes. The problem is that no substantive measures have yet been taken to remove the energy isolation in which many States and regions of the Union are doomed, particularly in the South and not in the North. The problem is that we have not yet been able to tackle the serious problems in energy supply while energy poverty is a major problem for a large proportion of citizens. What is needed is to make immediate use of the Union's domestic energy sources, to stop ignoring the role of deposits discovered in Cyprus, which is a Member State, but also of deposits in the wider Eastern Mediterranean and North Africa region. It is therefore necessary for the European Union to directly support energy investment in the Eastern Mediterranean, to promote the creation of a Mediterranean gas hub with pipelines and also with the development of liquefied natural gas production.

I think these visions are very important. It provides a basis for strengthening Europe as part of the world and strengthening our competitiveness, and also creates many more jobs in the future, but also for the long-term lower energy prices. The problem with this investment that we are talking about [...], it is that this will go directly against almost every point in the vision that we are talking about for the Energy Union.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Mr Caete, I would like to thank commissioner for his work We have now heard many important points from the previous speakers, including very critical points, as to why this Nord Stream 2 project should not be implemented, and these points must be taken seriously! This goes from a lack of diversification to the point where the European Union should not support this project. However, I would like to comment on a number of points which should perhaps be taken seriously. The first point is that let us look at the consortium that is carrying this major project. This is a consortium of a European dimension. This is not only Gazprom, but two German companies, Uniper and BASF Wintershall Holding, that is Shell, that is ANGI and that is the Austrian OMV – is a quite respectable group.  The second issue is European security of supply: Nord Stream 2 could double the capacity of the two existing strands by 55 to a total of 110 billion cubic metres of gas. It could supply gas to 52 million households in Europe and secure a third of Europe's gas needs. It is up to us, ladies and gentlemen, when we are talking about diversification, to develop the south-eastern corridor in the south-eastern Mediterranean – as a previous speaker has already mentioned today – and to ensure greater diversification.  Infrastructure spending: You mentioned recently, Commissioner Caete, last week, that Europe has an investment gap in the energy sector of EUR 200 billion.

Mr President, by doubling the capacity of the North Stream pipeline, the North Stream II project will allow imports of cheap Russian gas to increase on the European market, and this is economically positive.

As you can see, these restrictions jeopardise the economic viability of costly pipeline projects, especially in times of low prices such as the one we are going through. At the same time, the Commission must ensure that all Member States, not just Germany, have the same capacity to carry out the construction of energy infrastructure, at least from a legal point of view. It must not judge pipeline plans by double standards. The ideological policies imposed by the Commission under the third energy package already cost south stream cancellation in 2014.

It is incomprehensible that Europe's passivity relative to the attempts at diversification in the southern corridor.

All those gathered here, representing both the European Parliament and the European Commission, are aware that this project is not only an economic project, but above all a political one that is striking at the energy security of many european Union countries, including Polish. According to the latest forecasts, there is no significant increase in natural gas demand in the European Union as a whole in the coming years – in which case the expansion of Russian transmission infrastructure certainly has no economic justification. This is confirmed by the fact that the cost of building further strands is estimated at around EUR 10 billion, while the estimated costs of upgrading transmission infrastructure in Ukraine are half as low.  In addition, Nord Stream 2 prevents the development of the port of Świnoujście, which has already been mentioned very often and which is a political issue at the moment. Negative arguments or proposals have already been presented several times during meetings and debates in Parliament and the Commission. However, further questions remain, including how does the Commission intend to support projects that bring real diversification or eliminate bottlenecks within the European Union? Because these are real needs when it comes to energy infrastructure in the European Union, as opposed to Russia's additional capacity.  A few weeks ago, during a debate in the European Parliament, Commissioner Šefčovič suggested signing the Germany-Russia international agreement governing the legal status of Nord Stream 2. How does the German Government relate to this proposal? What are the arguments used by the European Commission to convince Germany to do so? Does the Nord Stream thread appear in discussions with partners outside the European Union, such as the US?

Commissioner, i would like to thank you for your comments. This information has already been in this Chamber, but I will remind you of it for the sake of order. The existing gas infrastructure allows nearly 250 billion m3 of gas to be transferred from Russia to Europe, while eu gas imports from Russia amounted to around 120 billion m3 in 2014 , i.e. only an incomplete 50% of the transmission capacity.  Secondly, the level of use of existing LNG infrastructure – liquefied gas – was only 25% in the Union in 2014. This means that as much as 75% of this infrastructure is unused, which in absolute terms amounts to 150 billion m3 of gas, which is significantly more than the Union imports from Russia.  Thirdly, after the first two Nord Stream pipelines were put into operation, the capacity utilities of gas pipelines passing through Ukrainian territory fell sharply in 2014 from 58% to 28%, while the use of the first two Nord Stream strands has increased from 36% to 60%, which means that nord stream 2's main objective will be to increase Russian capacity, thus completely eliminating gas transmission through Ukraine and making it difficult or even cutting off Russian gas for Slovakia and other central and eastern European countries.

Madam President, it is necessary but futile to recall that the unity of the Union is being broken by Germany and will soon collapse, not only because of the possible Brexit, illegal immigrants, austerity policies and the strangulation of Greece, which are policies imposed by Germany. It will collapse because it is now clear that more and more countries are openly resisting the policies most of which are being blackmailed: Roth Stream II is of exclusive interest to Germany, which is indifferent to the reactions of other states, such as Poland and Italy. Germany pursues a two-and-a-kind policy, prohibiting other countries from having privileged economic relations with Russia, while it benefits the most from them, against ethical and political norms. Germany has played a major role in its silence and tolerance of the Ukrainian crisis, drawing other Member States.

Let me say from the very beginning that I heard some honourable Members stressing that we were discussing gas too much and we should concentrate on other sources of energy. It is clear that after the Paris agreement on climate change, we are on a path of decarbonising our economies and developing renewables and energy efficiency, but it is also clear that it will take some time. In the meanwhile the cleanest fossil fuel is gas and we have to ensure security of supply for the 28 Member States of the European Union – not for a single Member State but for the 28 Member States of the European Union.  That is why the Commission is implementing a security of supply policy, trying to diversify sources, suppliers and routes. That is why we have come along with an LNG gas strategy on one side and that is why we are developing interconnectors in central and south-eastern Europe, that is why we have implemented reverse flows and that is why the Commission is supporting the Southern Corridor, which is another alternative source of supply. So the Commission will keep on applying these policies which are the ones needed to assure security supply all over the European Union. There were two specific clear questions. One was by Mr Hökmark who asked whether this project would make us more or less dependent on Russian gas. The answer is very clear, and you know it already, because we speak of about 100 bcm going through a single corridor. That would mean 26% of all European Union gas consumption and 80% of Russian gas imports on a single route. The answer is very clear. Due to the size, the route and the strategic character, it would probably change the architecture of today’s European gas market and further increase the dominance of Gazprom in the western European gas market.  The European Union has made a lot of progress in opening up and integrating energy markets. That is why the European Union should therefore make sure that no market operator is able to leverage its dominant position to the detriment of competitors and consumers. So it is clear that this may change. It is also clear that we have to review those changes and apply European laws. European laws must be applied in all aspects. I come back to Mr Buzek’s questions. He asked whether we were in contact with the German authorities. I can say that, following the mandate of the European Council, we have made contact with the German authorities on all levels and my services are in contact with the German regulators to have a complete picture of all the facts needed to assess the project. This is a complex project – it has an onshore part which touches the waters of five different Member States – and is difficult to evaluate.  But what I can say is that in the Commission we are convinced that European Union law needs to be applied, including the principles of energy law, which also need to be applied in the case of the offshore part. We will continue our discussions with the German authorities on what this entails in practice.  But beyond the application of the legal framework this project has very clear geopolitical consequences and all the Members who have intervened have pointed out those consequences. Thus this also needs to be discussed at a political level and that is why both Vice—President Šefčovič and I have explained exactly the same political concerns to the German Government on several occasions. What I can say in conclusion is that we all agree that energy produced in the European Union must be fully aligned with European Union core policy objectives, including energy security. We cannot look in an isolated way at infrastructure projects. We have to find comprehensive and well—balanced solutions which benefit all Member States alike, as well as our neighbours. So the Commission will take very seriously the remarks of the honourable Members. We will continue monitoring this process and applying European Union legislation. There was another question at the end on whether we have the opinion of the United States. We have the opinion, we hear the honourable Members, but I must say that just last Wednesday we had the Energy Council with the United States and we also discussed this topic, because it is a problem of geopolitical importance and is worth discussing in our bilateral relations with the United States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 116, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Anneli JÄÄTTEENMÄKI", "mepid": "28314", "text": "   The debate is closed.

It duplicates the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline and can become a Russian political weapon.  In order to stay resilient, the EU needs more cooperativeness and interconnection. This killer-project’s aim is opening up old divisions by destroying recently installed interconnectors in central Europe and by creating winners that will be directly supplied by Nord Stream 2 and losers bypassed by it.

It also had the construction of South Stream shut down, citing the third energy package. This position was appropriate from both an energy policy and a security policy perspective. However, now that Germany wants to build a pipeline, Gazprom suddenly appears as a reliable operator and, by reference to the specific rules on undersea pipelines, the Commission may even consider the proposed gas pipeline to be in line with the third energy package.  Strictly legally, this can be the case, but it must be seen that the authorisation of a project that also has an impact on the gas market in the CENTRAL AND EASTERN EUROPEAN region will also have a fundamental impact on the region's relationship with the Union, as it will be considered by the Member States as a double standard, not without reason.

Firstly, once the second strand of the Nord Stream gas pipeline has been built, these countries can be cut off at any time – for political reasons, for example – from Russian gas, on which they are still heavily dependent. Russia will be able to send gas to its strategic market, i.e. western Europe, without Ukraine.  Secondly, if this controversial investment is implemented, the countries of the region could lose billions of euros in gas transit charges to existing onshore pipelines.

The new common fisheries policy has very rigorous requirements in terms of marketing and traceability of fish and aquaculture products. The legislator defined both mandatory information and voluntary information for consumers, making information a crucial point of the legislation. Compulsory information is the following: the commercial designation of a species and its scientific name, the production method and fishing gear, the area where the product was caught or produced and a clear indication whether the product was defrosted. This mandatory information applies to both retail and supply for caterers and restaurants. It is critical that consumers have access to complete information in order to make an informed choice. Restaurants must always keep the information which they received when they bought the product in case consumers or state authorities ask for them. The resolution of the Committee on Fisheries discusses the Commission survey for control of 2015, which analyses the conformity of labelling with the legal requirements of white fish in retail. This sampling survey indicates that the species indicated on the label was correct in 94% of cases. However, numbers are worrying for some species, for which the level of conformity is very low: common species are substituted for more expensive species. This is often the case for bluefin tuna. In a separate study from last year on labelling in restaurants in Brussels, including the EU canteens, the NGO Oceana estimates mislabelling at 32% overall, with a mislabelling rate in bluefin tuna to be 80%. This observation brings us to ask Member States to enforce the existing law. Compulsory and correct information must be available for consumers all the way through the chain, including diners in restaurants. It is the duty of Member States to guarantee that this information is available and accurate. Member States must implement sanctions which are efficient, proportionate and dissuasive. First and foremost, Member States have to reinforce controls in order to identify fraud and the missing links in the supply chain for fishery and aquaculture products which lead to mislabelling or fraud. Further information on fish can be added to a label as an addition to compulsory information. This information can enable consumers to have complementary information such as the date of catch, date of landing, more information on fishing gear, the flag state, information on the nutritional value of the product or environmental, ethical or social information. Unfortunately, voluntary information can sometimes be difficult for consumers to interpret because of its diversity. It is also necessary that such information be reliable, meaning it must be controlled in a very strict manner. The Commission is currently working on the implementation of a pilot project proposed by Parliament last year – and my regards to our chair, Mr Cadec, who could not be here today. It deals with voluntary information on fishery products and aims at creating an up—to—date and exhaustive inventory of voluntary claims associated with fishery and aquaculture products, which are marketed in the European Union, whatever their origin. This inventory will enable an analysis of the certification systems of these claims. It could help in the creation of an external structure which scrutinises the certification of voluntary claims included on the label of fishery and aquaculture products. We are awaiting this external structure and hope that this information will be easily accessible to consumers. I would also like to remind the Commission that Parliament is still awaiting the Commission report on the possibility to define and establish minimum criteria for the creation of an EU ecolabel for fishery and aquaculture products. The publication of this report is a requirement of the common market organisation for fishery and aquaculture regulation. I would like to finish by asking all Member States to strengthen controls, because European consumers have a right to know what ends up on their plate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 130, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would first like to thank Ms Engström and the Committee on Fisheries (PECH), in particular Alain Cadec, for the opportunity to discuss this very important issue, which, as was mentioned, concerns consumer information and the traceability of fishery and aquaculture products. Significant efforts were made in the approval of the reformed common fisheries policy to improve consumer information and the fisheries policies control regulation has critically strengthened traceability. The motion for a resolution linked to this oral question identifies the key issues, and the Commission shares with you the sentiment that we still have to do more. But we must act on the basis of evidence, rather than on the basis of emotions. The results of one study should not be generalised, especially if we have other, broader studies published during the same period which indicate that significant progress has been made.  It is the case of the EU-coordinated Control Panel for Fisheries and Aquaculture Products, which covers not only three EU canteens and some restaurants around the EU institutions, but also covers 29 countries with more than 3 900 samples. I would also like to restate that this discussion about mislabelling only covers a specific item of consumer information: the name of the food and the risk of species substitution.  Concerning the study reference, it must be stressed that its authors do not take into account the applicable legislation in its findings. Mislabelling, particularly in the case of fish substitution, does not always result from an intention to commit fraud. Incorrect labels may also be the result of mistakes or mismanagement, and these situations occur much more often than fraud. So taking into account all these elements and the relevant EU and national laws, the Commission is of the view that the actual level of mislabelling is much lower than the figure published by Oceana. So we must be careful of the evidence we use, but having said that, this is an excellent opportunity to make the point that we need a proper understanding of traceability. Traceability is a tool for transmission of information from the ship’s deck or the farm to the plate. If a solid traceability system cannot avoid misconduct of operators or human errors, it can permit us to trace back to the moment when the misconduct or error occurred. Only extensive controls by Member States can avoid misconduct of operators and more generally reduce mislabelling. Funding has already been made available through the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund to support the development, purchase and installation of components to ensure the traceability of fisheries and aquaculture products and also to support the implementation of a Union control inspection and enforcement system.  Since 2010, the Commission has assessed control systems put in place by Member States to monitor the traceability of fishery and aquaculture products. Possibly deficiencies are being addressed through appropriate means. Moreover, the Commission has started a project on compliance and control of labelling and traceability. The Commission has also been proactive in the fight against mislabelling and fish substitution. In cooperation with 27 Member States and two EFTA countries, we recently completed a coordinated control plan for white fish. As I already mentioned, more than 3 900 samples were collected, representing a broad range of products and species. This demonstrated a level of non-compliance of 6%. Just a couple of weeks before the publication of the results of the coordinated control plan, the EU-funded label fish was also completed and this finding made public. Here again, out of more than 1 500 samples from different species, countries and products, less than 5% were found to be mislabelled. So while the Commission agrees that we can and must do more, we must also not portray a misleading image of a sector that is highly non—compliant. We should not risk increasing mistrust by EU consumers, particularly as we see from evidence that the level of irregularities is generally low. It is important to mention here the different testing protocols that can be used to identify species and aquaculture products officially. It is true that DNA-based methods represent the most promising approach. The Commission’s Joint Research Centre is actively working in this field, and the experience gained in conducting the EU-coordinated control plan for fishery products will be very useful. Concerning the potential of Eco labels, I note that you consider these as one among possible solutions to avoid mislabelling, but please be aware that an EU-wide Eco label would not necessarily strengthen traceability. Having clarified these points, I am glad to inform you – as also mentioned by Ms Engström, that the Commission is finalising the feasibility report on options for a Union-wide Eco label scheme for fishery and aquaculture products. This feasibility report is based on an external study as well as on a public consultation and interviews of stakeholders. It analyses various options. I hope that this feasibility report will provide useful information and ideas to feed the debates that will take place both in this House and with Member States and stakeholders.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 131, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Gabriel MATO", "mepid": "96936", "text": "  PPE Group. – Madam President, Commissioner, as the Vice-President of our Committee on Fisheries has rightly said, we are dealing with an issue which is by no means ballad. A certain study reveals labelling problems in fishing products served in some restaurants. Data and not emotions, the Commissioner said, and so it should be. Without going into assessing that report, the data of which appear to do not coincide with those of the Commission itself, what seems obvious in any case is that we are faced with a situation which goes beyond a problem of mislabeling. We need to be able to discern whether we are facing simple mistakes or full-rule fraud. And in both cases, we are obliged to put all means at our disposal so that neither one nor the other occurs.  In the European Union we are able – and we do well – to demand the highest standards for our products and in the fisheries sector we are particularly aware of the need for this to be the case.

Today technology allows sufficient monitoring of the origin of fishery products and has developed because consumers have the right to know what we eat and because there are groups that appreciate the difference and are willing to pay for it. In addition, there are producers who are committed to turning into facts principles such as the environmental, social and ethical sustainability of their productions. Therefore, the next step, the logical step, is to support labelling with more guarantees. Because it has been shown that willfulness favors fraud and harms those who comply. There are sectors and fisheries professionals who have been demanding more rigour in the traceability of fishery products and labels for years to support the effort to add value to fish production sold fresh or processed; labels that make it clear that most of that value is left to those who deserve it most. And these are those who fish or grow fishery products using traditional and sustainable techniques and who transform them by applying those values; in short, those who work to offer quality and a differentiated product and thus maintain employment and the environment in European coastal areas. This complaint was made clear at a seminar organized by my group on December 9. Experiences such as that of the \"mussel of Galicia\", the first fishery product to achieve a designation of origin, or that of the \"bonito del Norte\", show that stricter and more mandatory labelling regulations are necessary to guarantee the origin of fish, not only fresh, but also processed, and especially in canned ones.

Because today, more than ever, buying is a political act. Reliable labelling is essential to guarantee this right, but unfortunately the results of oceana's study, published on the labelling of fish that is served in restaurants in Brussels, reveal the Commission's frequent collusion with interests contrary to consumer rights. In this case, one in three fish does not correspond to what the consumer pays. I would like to remind the Commission that it must act forcefully, because incorrect, intentional and fraudulent labelling of fish species is a violation of European Union regulations, including the common fisheries policy.

First I would like to repeat that this discussion about mislabelling only covers a specific item of consumer information, that is to say the name of the food and the risk of species substitution. No study puts into question the consumer information requirements established by EU legislation.  I have to clarify also that the Commission is in no way trying to underplay the results published by Oceana, although I insist that we have more accurate studies and reports which, unfortunately, no one is referring to. Having said that, the Commission even took corrective action following the Oceana report. The Commission reminded its catering contractors of their duty to fulfil contractual obligations and tighten controls on fish product labelling in its canteens. A project for sampling in view of DNA identification of fish species is planned for 2016. As an additional measure a project for sampling in view of DNA identification of fish species is planned for 2016 in coordination with the JRC and other Commission services. Ms Engström also stressed the role that the Member States have to play in all this and I totally agree. In fact Member States must ensure traceability in restaurants, particularly under the framework of the CMO Regulation. The Control Regulation provides for a sound enforcement of the traceability requirements by the Member States which shall ensure that appropriate measures are systematically taken, including administrative action or even criminal proceedings in conformity with their national law against natural and legal persons suspected of a breach of any of the rules of the CFP. There was a remark made by Mr Kuhn that the consumer is king and I totally agree and that is why I tried to clearly explain that we must not portray a misleading image of a sector that is highly uncompliant when the evidence shows that the level of irregularities is low. We should not risk increasing mistrust by EU consumers, especially when bluefin tuna was mentioned because it is a fact that bluefin tuna is one of the highly traceable species globally. I can also assure everyone, especially our colleague Ms Briano, that Brussels is in no way trying to trick any consumers. Outcomes of audits carried out for 2010 and 2015 have allowed the identification of weaknesses in traceability of fish products and these were mainly due to gaps in exchanges of information especially and the identified deficiencies are being addressed. The recent modification of the implementing rules of the Control Regulation should also technically allow the improvement of interoperability of IT systems between the Member States.

Therefore, this sustainable fisheries partnership agreement (SFPA) will be a very good tool to do so, but I believe it will also benefit the European Union as a whole. The EU and Liberia already cooperate through multilateral agreements such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. In addition to that, Liberia cooperates with the EU in terms of fighting against illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.  The new agreement will provide a framework for taking into account the priorities of the reformed CFP and its external dimensions, with a view to establishing a strategic partnership between the European Union and Liberia. The main objective of the new Protocol is to provide fishing opportunities to Union vessels in the Liberian fishing zone. The Protocol offers opportunities to 34 tuna vessels from Spain and France based on the reference tonnage of 6 500 tonnes per year. In return, the EU will pay an average annual contribution of EUR 650 000, split equally between access rights and sectoral support for Liberia’s fishing policy. The aim is also to enhance cooperation between the EU and Liberia to promote a sustainable fisheries policy and a sound exploitation of fisheries resources in Liberia’s fishing zone in the interest of both sides.

Well, the Fisheries Protocol with Mauritania, which we are talking about today, is the finding that we are indeed taking steps forward and in the right direction. We have been able to sign a much better agreement than the previous one, both for the European fleet and mauritania and its inhabitants, who will be able to benefit not only from the economic counterpart agreed by the catches, but from the support of the European Union to contribute to its development. As will be put on the table throughout the discussion, this new agreement with Mauritania resolves some gaps in the previous Protocol, the usefulness of which left much to be desired. The restrictions imposed on the fleet then resulted in a weak use of the possibilities of capture, which were also greatly diminished after the elimination of a traditional fishing for the European fleet such as cephalopods. Fishing areas for the seafood fleet and for small pelagics have been adjusted to improve cohabitation with Mauritanian fleets and fishing opportunities for black hake trawl fleets and bottom longline fleets have been increased. The way in which the obligation to include Mauritanian personnel in European ships has also been improved, solving problems related to the level of qualification of Mauritanian sailors. The new Protocol also includes improvements for fleets of highly migratory species, as it may be carried out under conditions similar to those applied by other third countries, as control and access measures have been harmonised with those established for other tuna agreements. In the temporary area, it allows fishermen in the European Union to fish in Mauritanian waters for a period of four years; a breakthrough without a doubt. Until now, being more time-limited, there was a situation of negotiating the renewal of the agreement at about the same time as it came into force. These are therefore substantial improvements for our fleet and mauritania, and they will strengthen relations and solve, as I said before, some problems that also arise with regard to the fleet of third countries that worked in the same waters. On the economic point, the conditions agreed in this new Agreement substantially improve the cost-benefit ratio, which is also contributed to changes in technical measures. This Protocol has been being implemented provisionally since November 2015 and, so far, we can say that there is a good balance sheet, although at the end of this May we will hold a joint committee to analyse its progress and propose some improvement. Among them, something that the Commissioner has heard many times: the possibility of including that cephalopod fleet and that can return to Mauritanian waters. We know that it was one of the gaps in the Agreement and we understand that at the moment there are conditions necessary for this activity to resume, but we also know that Mauritania opposes and we are aware that its inclusion will be very difficult. In any case, we want to talk to you in this joint committee, even if we are not as optimistic as we would like. Another key issue: the possibility of introducing downloads of some of the catches at European ports; in the specific case, ports of the Canary Islands, Luz and Las Palmas. In principle, despite the Union's requests, only downloads were introduced in Mauritanian installations. We believe , and so does the Commission believe , that this exception can be considered, at least as long as Mauritanian port infrastructures are developed.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 154, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Karmenu Vella", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, it is a pleasure to jointly debate the Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement (SFPA) and associated protocols with Liberia and Mauritania. I would like to take the opportunity to thank both rapporteurs, Mr Wałęsa and Mr Mato, for their reports. I am pleased to note that the Committee on Fisheries also recommends that Parliament give its consent to both agreements. Let me now say a few words on each one of the agreements. I will start with Liberia. The new Sustainable Fisheries Partnership Agreement with Liberia is not one of our largest agreements in terms of fishing opportunities and in terms of financial layout. However, it is a very significant agreement because it expands the EU’s regional network of tuna agreements into West Africa.  The protocol to the agreement will last for five years and will allow up to 28 EU tuna seiners and six surface long liners to fish in the Liberian fishing zone. These vessels also operate under other agreements in the region. Therefore, the agreement with Liberia will contribute to extending the geographical coverage of fishing activities without increasing the fishing capacities. This agreement with Liberia also fully respects the principle of sustainability of fishing activities. It is based on the best and latest scientific data and the principles of transparency and non-discrimination with other foreign fleets. A human rights clause has also been included. The agreement also sends a strong signal that Liberia is open for business despite the difficult situation in the country after last year’s Ebola outbreak.  The Fisheries Agreement is a real partnership. It not only brings fishing opportunities for EU vessels and steady financial revenues for Liberia, but it also forms a framework for developing the Liberian fisheries sector and to fight illegal fishing together. The sectoral support available to Liberia under the agreement will be used to help reinforce its monitoring, control and surveillance capacities. This will enable it to control the fishing operations of all fleets operating in its waters and of its own fishing and carrier vessels, wherever they operate. Additionally, recent discussions with the Liberian authorities have opened the way to a complementary action under our development cooperation programme with Liberia to enhance the sectoral support under this agreement. While this is at an early stage, the Liberian authorities have requested additional support for, in particular, capacity-building, artisanal coastal fisheries, post—harvesting handling and local markets. I am confident that this new agreement with Liberia will develop into a long lasting partnership. Let me now turn to the protocol with Mauritania. The Fisheries Agreement with Mauritania is the European Union’s biggest sustainable fisheries partnership agreement in financial terms. It provides fishing opportunities to up to 98 EU vessels from 11 Member States and is therefore of crucial importance for the European Union fleet. The new Protocol is the result of intense negotiations. It is a significant improvement compared to the previous protocol and can be considered an example to be followed for the negotiation of future SFPAs with other countries. The new protocol is fully consistent with the external dimension of the reformed Common Fisheries Policy, as was also mentioned by Mr Mato and Mr Wałęsa. It respects the principle of sustainability and confirms the principles of transparency, preferential access for the EU fleet and non—discrimination between foreign fleets. The protocol will ensure good returns on EU taxpayers’ money and gives the EU fleet stability and predictability with improved technical conditions. It will ensure better implementation of sectoral support through more conditionality.  The focus now is on ensuring the smooth implementation of the new Protocol. I can assure you that the Commission will monitor closely the state of all the stocks covered by the protocol in order to ensure the sustainability of fishing activities. We will also check whether Mauritania respects the principles of transparency and non-discrimination. I think this is crucial to ensure that the EU fleet is not operating under less favourable technical and financial conditions than other foreign fleets. I consider it a very positive sign that Mauritania recently adhered to, and took a leadership role in, the Fisheries Transparency Initiative. I know many of you are interested in the first meeting of the joint committee, scheduled to take place at the end of May. I hope that at the meeting we can approve the sectoral support programming under the new protocol and wrap up sectoral support from the previous protocols. But we also intend to raise with Mauritania the possibility of creating a new demersal fishing category. Such a new category could benefit the trawlers which are currently unable to fish for octopus and other cephalopods due to the bad state of the stocks. We will also discuss the possibility of relaxing the obligation for EU pelagic vessels to trans-ship 100% of their catches exclusively in Nouadhibou.  Let me thank you again for today’s opportunity to debate these fisheries agreements with you. I look forward to your support in the future on these agreements.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 155, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Jordi Vicent SEBASTIA TALAVERA", "mepid": "125053", "text": "  draftser of the Opinion of the Committee on Development. – Mr President, in the Committee on Development we are fundamentally concerned about two issues when we face these fisheries agreements between the European Union and third countries, developing countries.

There are positive signs coming from both countries: reforms such as the abolition of slavery and torture in Mauritania or those on transparency and good governance initiated by Liberia. However, there are still countries where humanitarian aid and development cooperation are still needed in order to eradicate poverty, hunger and economic inequality.  The European Union continues to enter into different fisheries agreements with individual countries that share the same resource and the same sea. I would like to ask the Commissioner when we are going to start promoting a regional fisheries agreement that includes all the countries concerned together. As a member of this Parliament's Committee on Development, I must point out that, despite these agreements being addressed to developing countries in need of humanitarian aid, our opinion is limited to giving the committee's consent or not, renouncing the valuable contribution resulting from the committee's work.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 158, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Francisco José MILLÁN MON", "mepid": "28400", "text": "  PPE Group. – Mr President; I would first like to congratulate you, Commissioner, on the policy of concluding fisheries agreements. They are of vital importance to our fleet, but also to the development of the third-country fisheries sector, through funds for sectoral support. I encourage you, Commissioner, to continue along this line. The fisheries agreements with Mauritania and Liberia, although different from each other, are both important for the European fleet, including in my region, Galicia. Tuna, as has been said, is the main target species in the Liberia Agreement; it is a highly migratory species and that is why it makes every sense to foster a network of fisheries agreements in the area. The Protocol with Mauritania, as you said, Commissioner, is one of the most important that the European Union has. It is true that substantial improvements have been made from the previous one, but I have to regret, once again, the exclusion so far from the cephalopod fleet. In addition, the joint committee meeting, to be held on 30 and 31 May in Brussels, will address fishing opportunities for freezer trawlers of demersal species other than black hake. I would like, Commissioner, that scientific studies on the analysis of these stocks may be ready for the meeting. Depending on their results, fishing opportunities could be granted for this trawling fleet. Ladies and gentlemen, I conclude; the European fleet carries out sustainable fishing within and outside our borders and is the most controlled in the world. I therefore hope that Mauritania's surpluses in certain fisheries will not be granted to other less sustainable fleets, as has happened in the past to the detriment of stocks and also to our fishermen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 159, "date": "2016-05-09.json", "name": "Ulrike RODUST", "mepid": "93624", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

Liberia has also done this exemplary for several years. We are looking carefully at this example and also wish that the published information is both complete and reliable.

It thus limits the volume of fish devoted to freezer trawlers to 247,000 tonnes, compared to 300,000 tonnes in the previous agreement. In return, the EU will pay Mauritania 55 million euros a year, compared to 67 million euros in the previous agreement. However, Mauritania is a poor state, which ranks 161st in the world on the Human Development Index. That is why the 2015 agreement gives it additional financial assistance of 4.125 million euros per year, instead of only 3 million in the previous agreement. In addition, the 2015 agreement maintains the obligation to recruit 60% of Mauritanian sailors. It is therefore a fair agreement that serves European interests, while respecting Mauritania. I hope that this agreement will mark a new beginning in our relations with Mauritania, relations which have lacked mutual trust in recent years.

These two sustainable fisheries partnership agreements are both significant steps forward for different reasons. The agreement with Mauritania is the biggest so far. The agreement with Liberia will bring fisheries revenues and support fishermen in a country which is still reeling from last year’s Ebola outbreak. In both cases, all parties will all gain from reinforced monitoring, control and surveillance, from more transparency, from more predictability and from the better access and agreements that they will bring about. They provide the value for taxpayers’ money that you have called for. From your comments I can conclude that these partnership agreements are strongly supported in this House, and I would like to make some additional comments. A number of Members – including Mr Sebastià and Ms Briano – questioned the sustainability of these agreements. Yes, the sustainable fisheries partnership agreements concluded between the EU and these countries constitute a highly regulated and transparent framework for the fishing activities of the EU fleet in third-country waters. These fisheries partnership agreements form a legal framework which aims to ensure that the fishing activities of the EU fleets are respectful of stock status, of the environment and ecosystems and do not compete with local fishermen. The EU is leading by example in this respect, and no other fleet in the worlds has set the same standards of transparency and good governance in third-country waters. A number of Members – Mr Millán Mon, Ms Aguilera García and Mr Blanco López – spoke about cephalopods, and here I have to say that the most recent scientific assessments indicate that the corresponding stock is still over-exploited. Moreover, Mauritania confirmed its intention to reserve this fishery for its national fleet, thus no surplus is available and no fishing opportunities could be negotiated. However, the European Union will continue working with Mauritania towards the adoption of adequate management measures for the recovery of this stock. There was a mention of sharks, I think Mr Hoc mentioned the issue of sharks, and here I have to say that the EU fleet does not practise shark-finning whether in the EU or outside in non-EU waters. A number of MEPs also mentioned the artisan fleets, and I have to say that the sectoral support budget in both countries has earmarked amounts for their artisan fleets as well. With regard to Maria’s comment on slavery, these agreements are not only helping the EU fleets, but also helping these countries.

At this point I would like to highlight how we have been working for many years from the nearest European region, the Canary Islands, which develops, with the support of the European Union itself, some really interesting projects of collaboration with Mauritania, such as the recent Macapel, which opens up many opportunities for both sides. But, Commissioner, I'm worried about something. It seemed to me to understand that he was resigning, or that it was claimed that 100% of the catches have to be made in Nuadhibu, and the possibility that they could be made in the Canary Islands was being closed. I don't think we can resign ourselves. We have to negotiate. They know that being able to make landings in the Canary Islands is not only possible, but also does not harm them and is even good. Therefore, let us not give up in advance and move on with it. If we can resolve these issues, I am sure that we will definitely be closing an excellent framework for all, which must also serve as an example for the agreements signed by the European Union with other third countries.

The argument is that the ECB is concerned that this banknote encourages criminals, terrorist financing and money laundering. Seriously, do we really believe that a criminal stops being a criminal because instead of two five hundred euro notes, he now needs five two hundred euro notes and two instead of a suitcase of money? Nobody really can tell us that. What is really at stake is monetary policy. The ECB and Mario Draghi must push through negative interest rates. After all, if you no longer receive interest on your savings book, but have to pay interest, you will run into the cash and withdraw the money from the account.

Obviously it was and is a difficult process, by some estimates, in January 1990, there were about three million people in my country as tenants in nationalised buildings. We can't play with people's lives, especially since a lot of them were older people. It is true that the procedure was also cumbersome for the fact that many heirs submitted incomplete documents, but there is no evidence, none, that the principle of ethnicity or cult was applied in the process of restitution, as the Reformed Church complained. On the contrary, we recently saw in a small town in Aiud how the building returned to the Reformed Church endangered the lives of six families, with ten minors, by disconnecting from the electricity.
