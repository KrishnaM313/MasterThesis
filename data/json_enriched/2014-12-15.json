Freedom of the media and media pluralism are fundamental values of the European Union.  Turkey is a candidate country with which we are negotiating accession. However, our relations with candidate countries must be characterised by mutual honesty and openness.  Precisely because we take negotiations with Turkey seriously, it is our task to make it clear where progress is being made, but also where we fear that there are wrong things. Problems with freedom of the press and freedom of expression are nothing new in Turkey. We were astonished to note the raids against journalists and social media in the aftermath of the protest in Gezi Park.  Yesterday we saw another wave of raids against anti-government media and are concerned that this is a sign that the development against opposition media is a dangerous one and one that we are particularly observing. Ladies and gentlemen, this applies to all democratic constitutional states: criticism must be met with arguments, ideas and evidence, not with retaliation, intimidation and arrest of journalists.

As you all know, CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, which entered into force in 1975, seeks to protect species through international trade controls. It encompasses some 35,000 species, which are regulated in three appendices depending on the degree of protection they need. Since the Commission presented its proposal, there have been two new accessions to CITES, which currently has 180 parties, including all member states of the European Union. The European Union had so far observer status in CITES, as only Member States could be parties. However, this situation changed in November 2013, with the entry into force of the \"Gaborone Amendment\", which allows regional economic integration organizations made up of States to become parties to the Convention. The request for approval sent to Parliament by the Council bases its draft Decision on a single Article of the Treaty, Article 192 on the environment, where while the Commission had based its initial proposal on Articles 192 and 207 on the common commercial policy. The opinion of the Committee on Legal Affairs of this house considered that, in this case, the double legal basis proposed by the European Commission is appropriate. However, since Parliament has to adopt a recommendation concerning only the accession of the European Union to CITES, and has not been called upon to adopt a position on the legal basis, we have merely, in this context and only for the sake of legal clarity, merely mentioned the issue of the double legal basis in view. In our view, the European Union's accession to CITES is a logical and necessary step towards ensuring the Full Capacity of the European Union to follow its environmental policy objectives. Ms Ayuso says it is important to note that the rights and obligations of the Member States under the Convention will not be affected by this accession. In practice, the internal decision-making process will not be influenced, but will streamline the practices that are currently in place. For all the above, Mrs Ayuso asks me to convey to you that she believes that we should vote in favour of the European Union's accession to CITES.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 24, "date": "2014-12-15.json", "name": "Carlos Moedas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Madam President, Commissioner Vella regrets that he is not able to be in Strasbourg today. He is in Brussels at the Fisheries Council, but he has asked me to present the views of the Commission on this file to you.  I would like, first of all, to thank Ms Ayuso and Ms Herranz García for their excellent and efficient work on this particular file. When presenting these political guidelines to Parliament in July, President Juncker made clear that one of the aims of the new Commission is to reinforce the EU as a strong global actor. The EU accession to the CITES Convention is to be seen in this context. The CITES Convention aims to make international trade in wildlife species sustainable. It is a very operational and efficient instrument that regulates millions of cross-border movements of animals, plants and commodities derived from them, such as timber, leather goods, medicines, cosmetics and food products. In total, we are talking about 35 000 species that are covered by CITES. This wide scope, combined with the legally binding nature of its decisions and its robust compliance mechanism, makes the CITES Convention a critical tool to address the overexploitation of natural resources, which is one of the biggest threats to biodiversity today. The CITES Convention stands at the crossroads of environment, trade and development. These are all areas in which the EU is a leading actor on the international scene. These are also areas in which the EU has strong legislation and policies. The EU’s accession to the Convention will reflect its leading role, and it will increase the EU’s visibility and accountability. The situation will be similar to the other organisations such as the WTO, the FAO or the Convention on Biological Diversity, of which the EU has been a full member for many years. In operational terms, the way we prepare for CITES meetings will not change much after the EU accession, as there is a well-established practice to agree on common EU positions before each meeting. However, the EU will gain visibility at the CITES meetings, as EU positions will be expressed by the EU on matters of EU competence. The EU will also be able to participate fully in the various bodies set up under the Convention and contribute to its annual budget.  This accession comes at a particularly important time. CITES has recently engaged much more in regulating international trade in marine and timber species. These are very valuable commodities traded in large amounts. The EU has pushed for these, and our accession to CITES will allow us to increase our investment further to ensure that the international timber and fish trades are legal and sustainable. CITES is also at the forefront of the fight against wildlife trafficking, a problem which I know is important to this Parliament. The current dramatic surge in wildlife trafficking calls for a strong response from the international community. At its last meeting in July, the CITES Standing Committee adopted very concrete measures targeting the countries most involved in wildlife trafficking, particularly in ivory, rhino horns and rosewood. These measures need to be implemented within strict deadlines, and failure to do so could result in the adoption of trade sanctions. Increasingly, CITES is also engaging in close cooperation with international organisations like the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, and Interpol, which also specialise in combating organised crime. The EU must play its role in these global efforts, and the accession to CITES is a very concrete step towards facilitating this. To conclude, I would stress that the EU’s accession to CITES will reinforce both the EU as a global player and CITES as an essential multilateral instrument for sustainable development. The Commission is aware of the interest of Parliament in these matters, and we count on your support in finally making it possible for the EU to become a full party to CITES.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 25, "date": "2014-12-15.json", "name": "Dubravka ŠUICA", "mepid": "119434", "text": "  on behalf of the PPE Club. – Madam President, we can first thank Ms. Ayuzo and Ms. Garcia for doing an excellent job, and I can tell Mr. Commissioner on behalf of the European People's Party that you can count on our support, as I think this is a very important move given that the convention aims to establish worldwide control over the trade in endangered species of wild animals and plants. We know that since 1984 the European Union has been implementing the CITES Convention, but as we know, it could not sign it since only member states could. That is why it is very important that today, i.e. tomorrow, when we vote, the European Parliament adopts a recommendation on access to CITES, because as you said yourself, in November 2013 it was possible for the Union to join and be a full member.  Three aspects are important: both development, and international trade and environmental protection. And so far we have behaved in accordance with these provisions of this Convention, but then we referred to the provisions of the founding treaty of the European Union and that chapter that dealt with environmental protection.  In order to effectively implement this convention, I consider that continuous cooperation between all authorities is needed: customs, police, border, veterinary inspections, nature protection inspections. The annual value of international wildlife trade is estimated at billions of US dollars, and is classified on the illicit market by annual earnings for narcotics, arms and human trafficking.  Therefore, more than 35 000 species are being survived and therefore it is good that this document has come to the European Parliament, that through the convention we protect endangered species by prohibiting or making international trade in these species much more difficult by a specific permission system.  Endangered species of wild animals and plants whose trade is controlled are classified in three additions to the convention.

CITES protects more than 35 000 species and includes 178 countries, including all the Member States of the European Union. The EU can now finally be a contracting party and not just an observer. It is therefore a due act. This is due because the competences to implement the Convention fall, first and for all, on the European Union: it is a necessary step to make the protection of biodiversity and endangered species more effective. The protection, protection and improvement of the quality of the environment are the Union's priorities, according to the Treaties, together with the careful and rational use of natural resources and the international promotion of measures to solve environmental problems. In addition, the EU shall take measures for the proper functioning of the internal market and for the customs union, a common commercial policy.

CITES – as has already been said – offers protection to no less than 35 000 species of animals and plants. If, for example, the African black rhino was provisionally saved from extinction, this convention is one of the things that is being done. The World Wildlife Fund estimates the value of the illegal trade in endangered species and derivatives at USD 19 billion alone. This is the fourth largest illegal trade after drugs, counterfeiting and human trafficking. And the profits often finance war and terrorism. The CITES Treaty regulates international trade so that it can be done in a sustainable way with an eye for human needs and for the economy. Indeed, 180 countries have already joined CITES, including all 28 EU Member States.  Today we are talking about the European Union's accession to the agreement. As shadow rapporteur for the ECR Group, I can confirm that we support this accession. It promotes legal transparency about the precise role of the European Union and its effectiveness. By the way, this is not unique. The EU has previously joined other international environmental conventions such as the Bonn Convention, the Carthagena Protocol and the Nagoya Protocol.

The impact that losses like these have on ecosystems is catastrophic.  The EU and Member States must, of course, comply with obligations under this Convention, but it is one thing to ban or limit trade and it is another to effectively enforce it. One cannot ignore the fact that the vast majority of this illegal trade is carried out in the developing world in conflict zones. The EU, of course, should support these countries where they lack equipment and funds for enforcement, but we must also look at the bigger picture. If annual turnover for the illegal trade is estimated to be USD 19 billion – making it the fourth-largest illegal trade in the world – the extreme poverty of many African communities lends itself to this trade.

It is clearly a necessary and desirable development. However, as I see it, this step is only a drop in the bucket. Let me remind you that, despite the EU’s commitment to halve the loss of biodiversity in the EU by 2020 and to restore biodiversity wherever possible, in the longer term – as well as in the long-term vision for biodiversity for 2050 – natural capital and ecosystems services are being continuously depleted. This will have profound consequences for our wellbeing. As stated by the Commission itself, over half of the habitats and species covered by the EU Habitats Directive are considered to be in an unfavourable conservation status. There is evidence that the status of many ecosystems is reaching, or has already reached, the point of no return. It is estimated that each year we lose 3% of our GDP due to the loss of biodiversity. Besides undermining the economy through diversity loss, changes in habitats and ecosystems also erode social cohesion in and outside the EU. Thus we must step up efforts in Europe to achieve our biodiversity targets. We must ensure that none of the policies of the EU or of its Member States have harmful impacts on biodiversity. We must reinvest in natural capital, construct green infrastructure and ensure that all spending under the EU budget is supportive of halting the loss of biodiversity. I therefore urge the European Commission and all European decision-makers to set their priorities and structure their work mindful of the biodiversity targets, and not to compromise biodiversity, as it is crucial to sustaining the ecological systems and the services we all depend on.

CITES has been ratified by 180 countries around the world and is probably one of the most effective regulations that has contributed to the protection of protected species. The opportunity for the European Union to enter the Convention must, however, be an incentive to do even more, much more in the context of the illegal trafficking of wild species.

The European Union is increasingly a consumer but also a producer of illegally acquired natural resources to be marketed. There are over 37 000 registrations in the European database of abductions of species included in CITES, a clear sign of a huge illegal market.

The Republic of Croatia has been a party to the convention since 2000, has achieved very notable results in the fight against trade in exotic species, and this year a very large seizure of exotic plants and animals was carried out.  Every year, tens of millions of specimens of plants and animals enter the international wildlife trade, and the value of that trade is over $10 billion a year. Extremely rare and critically endangered Madagascar turtles on the illegal market fetch a price of up to 25 000 euros per piece, and rare Lear parrots from Brazil can cost a dizzying 90,000 euros per copy. A kilogram of rhino horn on the black market costs more than a kilogram of gold. Ivory is still a luxury product and a status symbol, so the price of raw ivory is up to 5 000 euros per kilogram, while carved items cost a lot more.  The demand for these products has resulted in mass poaching of these species, so in 2012 22,000 elephants were killed in poaching, and over 1,000 rhinos have died in south Africa's territory alone due to poaching. Unfortunately, people are also suffering in the whole process, so globally, 56 rangers have lost their lives on official duty in the past 12 months, 29 of whom have been killed by poachers.

We have a moral obligation to stop this madness before tens of thousands of animal and plant species leave the world stage forever every year. We can stop species extinction by combating climate change, by taking action against rainforest destruction, by reducing livestock farming, but also by restricting trade. One effective option would be to increase the EU's influence in the forthcoming CITES negotiations through full EU membership.

As is known, the history of the Convention dates back to July 1, 1975 and includes more than 35,000 species of endangered animals and plants. Let me point out that from Slovak species they are such rare species as king eagle, hunting falcon or river otter. The accession of the European Union to CITES ensures greater transparency of the Union's legal position within CITES vis-à-vis third parties to the Convention. Rather, the current observer status represented a disadvantage and did not allow the Union to fully implement its environmental policy objectives. The Union will contribute 2.5% of the total amount of the CITES Trust Fund each year, which is around EUR 115 000 next year, and member states' contributions will be reduced accordingly. This is further proof of the advantage of the common European procedure. Accession will enable the Commission to take a unified position on behalf of the Union, thereby improving the EU's position in controlling international trade.

Wildlife trafficking, for example, is not only unethical because of the harm it causes to animals, but is also depriving local communities of sustainable development opportunities, robbing countries of potential tax revenues, deterring investment, providing financing to terrorist groups and enabling the spread of diseases like Ebola.

By hering to CITES, the Eu ropean Union will further strengthen its leadership in environmental, animal protection and environmental policy, ensuring that international trade in endangered specimens does not reduce its survival at INTERNATIONAL LEVEL.

I hope this long discussion on the calculation methods and reporting requirements pursuant to Article 7a of the Fuel Quality Directive can come to an end so that Member States can start to transpose these elements of the 2020 climate and energy package. We must now ensure that the Member States can put mitigation measures in place to achieve the 6 % greenhouse gas reduction target in fuels by 2020. The Council has reached a qualified majority on the Commission’s October proposal. However, I understand that some Members of this Parliament consider the proposal unambitious, claiming that it will not prevent unconventional sources of oil such as tar sands coming onto the EU market. The Commission would like to recall that the purpose of Article 7a of the Fuel Quality Directive is to reduce the carbon content of fuel used for road transport. The aim of the directive is not to discourage the use of any specific type of fuel but to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures are put in place to achieve the 6 % greenhouse gas reduction target by 2020. The Commission is convinced that the Fuel Quality Directive’s greenhouse gas reduction target can be implemented effectively both domestically and abroad through the proposal. The new Commission proposal agreed by the Council is thus a balanced and workable compromise as it delivers the objectives of the basic act while addressing key stakeholder concerns in an adequate manner. However, the Commission will be evaluating the experience with Article 7a of the Directive as part of its better regulation programme for the period after 2020. All options will be analysed to bring down greenhouse gas emissions from transport fuels in line with the overall target of achieving a reduction of at least 40 % by 2030.

Thank you very much for the word. Madam President, Honourable Commissioner, my fellow Members, I would like to thank you for your support. Reducing greenhouse gas emissions from fuels is an important element of the European Union's efforts to combat climate change. The European Union, as a pioneer in this fight at international level, cannot afford not to achieve its objectives.  At the same time, we must achieve these objectives in the interests of industry. We need to create regulations that impose as little bureaucratic burden as possible on economic operators. We are both responsible for protecting our environment and for the competitiveness of the continent and for preserving jobs. In my opinion, in the Commission's proposal, these aspects are properly combined.  I would like to draw the attention of my fellow Members who wish to vote against the Commission's proposal in so that they risk five years of work even with the best of intentions. This is a compromise proposal, so it is far from perfect, but a consensus solution has been reached through lengthy negotiations, which will lead to the start of work on reducing emissions. For distributors to report greenhouse gas emission levels for the raw materials they actually use sounds good. Unfortunately, the practical implementation of this does not seem realistic. On the one hand, it is not possible to verify whether the producing countries provide the EU with credible data and, on the other hand, obtaining the necessary certificates would place a disproportionate administrative burden on industry.  Furthermore, this methodology may put market participants who have no intention of importing Canadian oil sands, for example, at a competitive disadvantage, but have limited opportunities for the purchase of raw materials. The average overall value is, in my opinion, a good tool for bridging these problems.  Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank you for your support. I therefore propose, on this basis, that we adopt the Commission's proposal. A possible rejection could also put the 6% emission reduction target at risk.

It has just been said that we have realistic values here. If values are reduced by 40% from 2011 to 2014 – by 40%! – then you have to make it stupid. You have to think: what is the reason? Have any environmental aspects been added? No, I don't think so. I believe that it has something to do with negotiations on a free trade agreement. I can only say and warn against this: if this is to be done in the future in such a way that laws that have been put in place under the climate and energy package are so watered down and broken in the comitology procedure, then we can soon pack up, then we in the European Union will become a joke figure in the international negotiations.

I think it is nice that you are here today, but I would have expected someone else – or two would have stood for the alternative, but good that you are there – with whom we are discussing. I would have liked the Commission to come here with a clear message about how we can get the cow off the ice. All that remains for us is to say yes or no. And the pendulum is swinging towards 'no', because we are providing the blueprint for future negotiations on free trade agreements for all international partners who want to negotiate something with the EU.

Well, in actual fact this decision on the Fuel Quality Directive (FQD) is being considered under the regulatory procedure with scrutiny, as it relates to pre-Lisbon regulatory procedure and this has not been aligned. This means that the objection must be justified. It is not a question of saying yes or no. The objection must be justified on one of three grounds. The proposers of the objection have chosen ground number three, that it is incompatible with the aim and content of the basic Act. This suggests that the measure is inappropriate for accurate estimating and reporting of the volume, type, origin and lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of the fuels supplied. Whilst for me also it does not go quite as far as some Members would like, the case for grounds under point 3 is not proven. I think there is much to recommend the Commission’s proposal. The proposal requires major fuel suppliers to disclose the trade names and volumes of the crude oils they import. This is a positive step and will provide a level of transparency to the public that does not currently exist in the EU. As trade names are generally associated with crude oil types, the tracking of this information will allow for a simpler updating of the EU fossil fuel mix’s carbon intensity in the future. Furthermore, with the Fuel Quality Directive currently not included in the Commission’s post-2020 Energy and Climate Framework, the adoption of this objection will only serve to undermine the credibility of the FQD by forcing additional institutional delay on a piece of legislation set to expire in six years. I think this would be a poor way forward and that the better compromise – and Mr Groote is looking for a compromise from the Commission – would be for Parliament to move forward with the Commission’s proposal in the spirit in which it has been offered, that is, as a way forward, and make sure that we get somewhere in the next several years, and do not just leave this lying in an interinstitutional wrangle.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 2, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 66, "date": "2014-12-15.json", "name": "Gerben-Jan GERBRANDY", "mepid": "96940", "text": "  on behalf of the ALDE Group. – Madam President, it was this weekend that I returned from Lima where the climate summit took place, and I must say that I was impressed by the broadly shared determination to fight climate change.

Let us face it: the world will emit more CO2 tomorrow than today, and more the day after tomorrow than tomorrow. For that reason, it is crucial that public policy pushes investments towards a low-carbon economy. As regards the Fuel Quality Directive, differentiation between different feedstocks is crucial, but the current implementing measure does not do this any more. So highly polluting Nigerian crude or tar sand oils from other parts of the world are treated equally with much cleaner feedstock oils. That is against the objectives of the Fuel Quality Directive, and for that reason I tabled – together with a few other groups – the objection.  I am, therefore, extremely disappointed by the statement from the Commission here today. I expected a much stronger commitment to the objectives of the Fuel Quality Directive.

I ask this because its text responds exactly to what the oil lobby demanded: to open wide the oil doors of Canadian tar sands. They are well known that this fuel emits far more greenhouse gases than conventional oil refining — they know this because this is because it is written in the Commission's reports, in their reports. It is regrettable that these imports will not be penalized, but it is even more serious that they do not even try to control the increase in consumption of this harmful oil. As we have been denouncing, the Free Trade Agenda of the Council and the Commission, the agreements with Canada, with the United States, are conditional on eliminating laws that protect European citizens from environmental abuses, and this is a clear example of this. These setbacks aggravate the inconsistencies in the Union's energy efficiency policies. Even if these policies were implemented correctly, the imperatives of accumulation and profit lead the market to devour efficiency improvements: what is saved ends up being desustainable, environmentally and socially sustainable forms of production and consumption.

Let me be very clear, we are strong defenders of the Fuel Quality Directive. We think that, theoretically, this can be a very efficient tool. But that is the problem, we say theoretically, because with this proposal the Commission is deliberately weakening the proposal. It is weakening the effectiveness of the proposal, and I say this also to my colleague Julie Girling, who is saying you can only object on legal grounds.  If you read the impact assessment, with this proposal the Commission is deliberately taking away one of the options to achieve the 6 % reduction. Because of this proposal we can no longer differentiate between different feedstocks which is one of the three ways by which we can achieve the reduction. So this is literally taking away the efficiency of one of these measures, and that is what we are against. And this is very interesting, because if you read the impact assessment – and we are talking about better regulation, tomorrow the Commission will present a programme on better regulation – the most efficient proposal should be the proposal from 2011. That is in the emissions impact assessment. So why is the Commission not following its own impact assessment, not following its own proposal of 2011? Has the world changed? No, if you read the impact assessment all the values are the same as in 2011.  So we can only start to guess what happened, and indeed I come to the same conclusion as my colleague Matthias Groote. This is a consequence of the Canadian lobby. Probably all of you have been called or received e-mails from the Canadians saying that we really should support this measure. Why? Because now we can no longer differentiate between the fuel types and therefore the door will be open to tar sands. And that, of course, is the biggest problem: we are defending the Canadian lobby here. And let me say to the Canadians, who are probably listening, this is not against Canada. We just want to have differentiation between different fuel types. If the Canadians can show they can produce a clean fuel type, even cleaner than just normal oil, then they should also get the credit for that. So you need differentiation between fuel stocks. If you are more polluting it should be counted as such. If you are less polluting it should be counted as such. That is what we call better regulation, and that is not in the proposal. This is really going against the core of the Fuel Quality Directive. I agree very much with my colleague, Gerben-Jan Gerbrandy. I was hoping that the Commission would get the point, that the Commission would realise that the Fuel Quality Directive and its methodology is something that is important and should be preserved. However, the Commission has only said we will review, we will organise a congress, and that is it. Sorry, we really want to hear more. How is the Commission going to make sure that after 2020 we will have a proposal that takes into account the differentiation between different fuel types so that the good ones are rewarded and the bad ones are not rewarded? That is what we are aiming for. And to my colleague from the EPP who said that this will throw away five years’ work, I say no, it is this proposal that is doing precisely that because officially the Commission is saying this methodology will end by 2020, and they are now just making an empty proposal. So if you really are concerned about the methodology then we should really fight for the proposal that was on the table in 2011 which does differentiate between different fuel types and which is even supported by ePure – not always my friends when they do their biofuel lobbying, but they also see that they are no longer being rewarded and are therefore saying that this time they agree to us objecting to the proposal. And I think that is also important for my Christian Democrat colleagues.

If the subject were less serious, I would be tempted to say, with a touch of irony, that it becomes a Mexican, if not Peruvian, simplicity. In Lima , and with the prospect of a hypothetical global agreement at the end of 2015 in Paris, speakers discussed the sex of angels, with strong legal references, whether the solution lay in a binding international treaty or in a simple protocol, more flexible for developing countries. The Commission directive we are discussing today is one of the aspects of the European institutions' climate and energy policy. The Commission proposes five main axes for calculating the constraints that will be imposed on fuel producers to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions. It relies on highly technical considerations to do so. It is this method of calculation that is disputed by our excellent colleagues Gerbrandy and Eickhout. The two sides share at least one thing in common: both hide behind highly legal and mathematical considerations to conceal partisan motives, which take over the need for a real ecological policy. We blame the Commission's method of calculating for being a reflection of the well-understood interests of the North American oil industry. Canada's Minister of Natural Resources has publicly committed himself to European legislation that would be concerned with conventional supplies, reminding us of our international trade obligations.

The revised proposal ignores several recommendations of the European Parliament, including a differentiation between different fuel feedstocks. The Commission has also failed to recognise the results of its own impact assessments. As a result, highly polluting fuels, such as tar sands oil, will now be reported with the same emission values as conventional fuel stocks. And companies will be prevented from being able to report, even voluntarily, on real fuel emissions.  Rather than investing in cleaner fuels, the EU is opening up its market to dirty tar sands oil. This could mean nearly 7% of transport fuels in the EU are likely to come from Canadian tar sands by 2020. Mr Commissioner, please develop new proposals to extend the Fuel Quality Directive beyond 2020, taking into account the highly polluting nature of tar sands oil. If the EU is serious about leading the global fight against climate change, it must show it is serious about reducing emissions from the transport sector.

Under the proposed new calculation methods, Canadian tar sands, which represent high levels of pollution, are allocated, for example, an average greenhouse gas intensity value below their actual emission value and will therefore be favoured to be imported into the European market.

This is also reflected in the European Commission's own impact assessment from 2011.  The Commission now wants to treat all sources equally. It goes against its own impact assessment and against the European targets to reduce CO2 emissions. Without this differentiation, the European market will be quickly flooded with fuels from particularly polluting tar sands and shale oil. On the road to a trade agreement with Canada, the Commission has been wrapped up by canada's lobbying work, which wants to wear out its tar sands oil here. The alignment of fuels illustrates the progress we would make in reducing greenhouse gases in transport.

We are fully aware that it is also of paramount importance for this Parliament. It is an obligation for drivers and operators to respect and apply these rules. Daily enforcement is primarily the responsibility of Member States. This proposal on common classification of serious infringements is there to help Member States to improve compliance and thereby increase safety on European roads. Its adoption would provide Member States with a common basis for assessing the good repute of transport operators in the event of infringements. The Commission has worked for over two years in order to come up with a balanced proposal on classification. This work should not be wasted. I know that some of you would wish to be even more ambitious and extend the scope to other infringements, in particular those of a social nature. Others evidently believe it goes too far. We all know that the glass can be seen as half-full or half-empty. But this proposal is clearly in line with the objectives and within the limits of the mandate this Parliament, as co-legislator, gave to the Commission. Accordingly, it would be difficult to explain to European citizens that the text on the table, which aims specifically to facilitate cross-border compliance with EU rules, may not be adopted. Road safety comes first for me; and whatever your decision is, I will continue to work with Parliament on this subject. But let me stress one more time that, among the negative consequences of possible rejection, we would face legal uncertainty for enforcers, unequal treatment of drivers and operators, as well as ineffective or even non-existent exchange of data on serious infringements between Member States for quite some time to come. Please keep this in mind when you vote. Please also note that we will always continue looking for new opportunities to keep our roads safe and working conditions fair. Finally, I would like to confirm again that the Commission is committed to continue the work on better enforcement of this acquis, and we hope that we can do so in close cooperation with you.

We may be doing something unusual today, but we are not doing anything undue. With the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Parliament has been given the right to review wherever the Commission is instructed to clarify or provide technical details and to lay down the specifications for the implementation of a directive wherever the Commission is instructed to clarify legislation. And that's what we did. We have checked what the Commission has worked out. Commissioner, I have almost been in tears at your speech, as you have impressively asked us what we have to do. I would have been pleased if you or your predecessor or the services you now are in chief had done what is laid down in the directive over the last two years. If you look at the delegated act, you see that it does not contribute to clarification, but everything remains vague and unclear. The task of this delegated act is to clarify and clearly specify when there has been a serious breach of the rules and not to put it back in the hands of the administrative authorities of the Member States. In other words, the political will of the legislator has not been carried out, but has been disregarded. In its delegated act, the Commission makes a distinction between minor, medium and serious infringements. This is generally to be welcomed. But if you take a closer look at the categorization, the classification – what is a light, a medium, a serious violation? – then everything remains vague again. There is no answer. But that is exactly what we have asked the Commission to do: to enshrine it in a delegated act. I would like to point out that, as far as road safety is concerned, we have a large number of laws and directives in force. When I look at what is in your delegated act, and when I look at what we have in the directive on the transport of dangerous goods, for example, things do not fit together. In other words, the Commission has also done something different here from what is formulated in other legislative texts. What I, and what we in the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, are fundamentally opposed to is that the transport industry and the many drivers who travel every day so that we in Europe can also experience the added value of the internal market are placed under general suspicion. We have a picture of an entrepreneur and an employee that is positive. You have a negative image.

First of all, Welcome, i believe that this is your first appearance here in the European Parliament – certainly not the last. Now I am well aware, Commissioner, that what is available does not necessarily come from your pen. I think it is fair to say that you have taken this from the last period from your predecessor, Mr Kallas. Now, of course, we know that, at a time when the European Union is trying to further liberalise freight transport, and in the end we are also trying to make everything more efficient through innovation and technical aids – and here I am with the previous speaker – the workers are falling a little by the wayside.  The European logistics industry, if you look at this, has an annual turnover of EUR 900 billion. That is a good thing, and it is a good place to do so. However, we must not forget those who contribute to this turnover. These are the workers who drive our goods, which we need every day, from A to B in the European Union on a daily basis. That is why I believe that this aspect must be added, and that has not been sufficiently done in the final stage of this proposal. If we look at the negative effects of so-called illegal cabotage – Commissioner, and I am convinced that you are actually with us on this point, as you have repeatedly said clearly in the hearings that you will not allow social dumping – we are at the moment in a situation in which health and safety at work and social standards are clearly being undermined. , and I believe that we simply have to stand up for these values. We must ensure that the categorisation as it is is supplemented is ultimately supplemented, as we have also told your service and its staff, that we ask that they be supplemented in order to clarify matters such as .B letterbox companies and social dumping. We will also reject this proposal, as it is on the table, and I hope that we will eventually be given a majority to reject it on Wednesday, in the hope – and I am in favour of this, by the way – that you will eventually take it up and take the opportunity to draw up a better legislative proposal in a relatively short time and to present it to the European Parliament. Then I believe that we can all work together on the content once again, and we can once again clearly develop the definitions. Then everyone knows what they are up to.

I am pleased that today we can participate together in this first debate with you on an important issue. A draft implementing regulation on the classification of serious infringements of EU rules, which could lead to a loss of good repute by the road haulier, will be voted on by the House on Wednesday. At the last meeting of the Committee on Transport, it was decided to refer this proposal back to the European Commission to supplement it. I agree with the past, and I hope that the European Parliament will confirm on Wednesday this decision of the Committee on Transport, which was already taken a few days ago. Why? Because the list submitted is not complete and does not exhaust both all categories of infringements leading to the loss of the good repute of transport operators, nor those that create a risk of serious injury to road users, as well as the social expectations of drivers. The European Commission's proposal is therefore not balanced, which consequently does not take into account the interests of either employers or employees. We expect a more rational approach, an in-depth analysis of the arguments of both parties and safeguarding their interests. The catalogue of infringements should in no way undermine the principle of subsidiarity or seek to eliminate road hauliers from the transport market.

This is indeed something historic for you, so you can say that. I liked the way in which you said that you want to work very closely with us in the future and that you are also saying that what is now available is appropriate to create legal clarity, to remove legal uncertainties and, at the same time, to be able to better punish all those who commit crimes in the transport sector. That is what should be done. You were not responsible for this yourself, as was still your predecessor – absolutely right. But two years of weighing up what can be done to better account for traffic offenders in international road transport. It has already been said that some people do not find it quite optimal how it went. I too do not have some details in the proposal. But overall, it can be said that this is a step in the right direction. We now have an opportunity – and this is necessary – to say more precisely how the rules are to be implemented now. This gives the Member States the assurance that they will be able to act accordingly. It was the case that, of course, some in the sector wrote to us – especially in Germany, there were many bus operators – who were afraid that the twelve-day rule could be repealed. That is not really the case. I have looked at it in more detail, that is not the case. On the contrary, it is even the case that this is to be maintained, and bus operators now know this too. As Mr Ferber said, we can reject what the Commission is proposing in this case, and that is always Parliament's right. However, I have the feeling, particularly in the case of what Mr Ferber said, that he contradicted himself in my terms, because, on the one hand, he said that various matters are not clearly regulated, with minor, medium and serious infringements. At the same time, he spoke of a general suspicion against all hauliers. In my opinion, this is contradictory.

Madam President, Commissioner, on 30 January 2009, the European Commission adapted the 2006 directive. This directive was essential: it established rules on the control of legislation in the road sector, including driving, rest and rest times for European road drivers. The aim was to establish a common classification of social law violations in the road sector based on their seriousness, which should have put an end to the current disparities. Indeed, today an offence can be considered serious in one country and minor in another. The process of harmonizing the social and wage standards of road drivers has not progressed at the same rate as market liberalisation. Some companies use social dumping practices, which reduce their production costs by reducing labour costs at the same time. Road drivers are the first victims of this situation. Unfair competition practices run counter to their social rights and are pulling the whole of Europe down. It is high time to defend an upward harmonisation of the rights of European employees. What about today? Many states do not play the game, while the very purpose of a classification is to allow targeted control in companies where the level of compliance is too low. The Commission's proposal does not strengthen this harmonisation: on the contrary, it weakens it. So it is high time, really, to be ambitious today. We therefore ask you to include in this list of offences new criteria such as the violation of the rules on the certificates of road drivers, by adopting a real new legislation on the transport of hazardous materials, but also all the illegal practices that are too widespread, which result in an increase in social dumping in this sector at European level.

We have already discussed this briefly in your interview. Now, of course, it is important to all of us that we achieve an improvement in road safety on Europe's roads. In this case, it is also, in principle, welcome to have a uniform Europe-wide regulation, something to combat scrap trucks. In Austria, we are particularly affected by this, because the proximity to eastern states is once again reflected on our roads. This now applies not only to road safety, as has already been mentioned on several occasions, but also to the workers who work in this area. I think the approach is a good one, namely that it is said that companies should set up the checkpoints – as we have here – and I think that makes sense. The idea of a traffic manager is also something that will have to prove itself in practice, but I think that also makes sense. For me, the question arises, as some Members have already said, how the classifications that are carried out there are then specifically explained, whether the subjects of the law then know exactly what to do there. I think that is doubtful.

Good luck and a pleasant collaboration in the coming years! We are discussing a list of serious violations in the transport sector today. We all know that transport is a vital part of the European economy and we would like to work with the Juncker Commission to improve the transport sector, make it fairer, ensure good competition, but also good social conditions for workers. Our group has come to the conclusion that this list is unclear and incomplete. That is actually the main objection. The list is a good start in itself, but under the current economic conditions it is unclear and incomplete. This applies to both employers and employees. If employers do not comply with this list, they may lose their reputation as a reliable transport company. These employers do indeed have something to lose. And it has to be clear to the employers that they do have to abide by and what they don't have to abide by. The same applies to the workers. Of course, there is also a social aspect in this list. There are several elements for workers in European transport policy that are unclear at the moment: elements such as remuneration, safety, and you name it. So we want a new list. And I fully understand what the Commissioner is saying – and whatever Mrs Meissner says – that we are now delaying, creating uncertainty. But if the Commissioner starts a new list at the beginning of next year, we will be able to approve it again before the summer recess and then everyone will know where he or she is at. Moreover, there is another element: unclear lists are extremely difficult for enforcers, the national inspections. We all know that one of the major problems in European law at the moment is: 'Can we maintain the things we agree on here?' Therefore, thanks for the start.

We see daily cases where the rules of the internal market are overridden by rogue operators in order to compete on unfair terms. When that happens, it is the drivers and the serious companies who suffer negatively. And we know that competition in the internal market must take place on an equal footing, that it must benefit both employers and workers and all Member States.  For it is when we fail to do just that that we create a breeding ground for populist and nationalist parties and movements that want nothing more than to find excuses to break up cooperation and back into the future. Unfortunately, in my country, the cheating of cabotage rules and other labour market legislation is too widespread. It is time for the European Commission to stop turning a blind eye to the problems experienced by people in the transport industry. If people and businesses feel that they do not benefit from being part of the internal market, but rather that it threatens one's pay and job security or even the chance of survival of one, then one needs to know that those who have the power to change are also prepared to do something.  If the answer instead is, 'no, we see no problems' and 'no, we are not going to do anything about it', then confidence is quickly eroded. Illegal cabotage services are a serious threat to the EU and the basic idea of free movement. The addition of these offences to the list of serious infringements is logical and necessary in order to show that we take the problems seriously. When drivers are used for work in slave-like conditions, this obviously entails a lower road safety, an increased risk of serious injury and death.  Should the EU choose to say 'no illegal cabotage and social dumping is not so serious', I can promise that many across Europe would be extremely disappointed, because this is exactly what many see as the biggest problems today.

In my opinion, is the European Commission's proposal perfect? My answer to that is no. It does not include all possible violations that transporters can commit and which would jeopardize their good reputation. However, this proposal does offer a very good starting point for tackling the rogue transporters. We very often draw up European rules here in this House and think that this will level the European playing field. But that level playing field very often only arises if the rules are actually effectively implemented throughout Europe, are enforced, sanctioned. The Commission's proposal is now in danger of being rejected. Effective implementation, enforcement and sanctioning of the rules in road transport is therefore not one step closer, but a step further away. This brings me to a final point, which is also very closely related to this. It concerns the introduction of the minimum wage in Germany on 1 January 2015. This brings with it a great deal of uncertainty for the European transport sector.

We have over 2000 cars operating illegal domestic traffic in Sweden; it is proven by an investigation. It is not possible to say that this can be fixed at national level because it is under the umbrella of the European Union that this is allowed to happen. It is European legislation that makes it possible. We must act with vigour here.

The main point, which other Members have also made and which I share, concerns the centrality of transport in the future of the Union, both as regards the transport of goods and as regards the transport of persons. However, we have ventured on a very complex and in some ways dangerous path: that is, the Commission has decided to indicate in the delegated acts, strictly, which are the cases in which the carrier is in danger of losing his good repute and therefore risks losing his authorization to carry out his service. That is where I question what some of my fellow Members have also said. When do you decide to indicate the cases in which you risk losing your good repute? If the indication is exhaustive, the reasoning is not valid so if we have done something good, it is appropriate not to delete it and move forward. In fact, as long as they are identified by means of a general criteria rule, then one can accept the beginning of a journey. But when it comes to the mandatory indication, anything that is not included in the mandatory list, is granted. Or rather: everything that is not indicated, in this case, as serious – because that is the point – will not be such as to allow the suspension of the authorisation to the service. So, at this point, I take as an example the case that, in my country but also in others, it is considered absolutely the most serious, namely that of illegal cabotage: the fact that the mandatory indication provided for in the delegated act does not qualify illegal cabotage as such, also worries my country about the social consequences that this will have. Therefore, serious consequences on the business front but serious consequences also on the social dumping front.

Saying that 500 million people are a single market does not make them one. A single market based on freedom of movement can only work when there is something approaching a common standard of living. There is not. Poor income in Bulgaria and Romania does not even give a monthly wage which is as good as the UK’s minimum wage. This means that the lorry drivers of the UK simply cannot compete and earn a decent day’s living. We know there is widespread corruption with licences that can be bought on the Internet. This has led to some unqualified drivers on our roads.  Let me make a couple of points clear. I am not blaming the people of Eastern Europe; they just want to make a living. I am not opposing free trade; but the role of the markets is to increase prosperity, not to create a rush to the bottom. These problems are completely and utterly the result of pie-in-the-sky thinking by EU decision makers. It is the EU’s economic illiteracy which is to blame. When will they understand that the objective is prosperity? They talk about good repute of lorry drivers. It is not lorry drivers who are the problem. It is the unelected Brussels Commissioners and their bureaucratic staff who are dreaming up policies devoid of any understanding of how the real world works.

The regulation, which is the subject of our discussion today, resolves the issue of infringements of the so-called good repute and its loss by road hauliers. In my view, the Commission has not fully defined all road safety offences and it is important to agree with those who raise those doubts. A delegated act should be full, transparent and lead to better compliance with the law, not allow for free interpretation and selective treatment. We have too many road accidents and related human tragedies to treat the subject superficially. I therefore support those who say that the list of infringements should be supplemented.  The discussion on the regulation has also opened up another area which is causing more and more controversy, which concerns cabotage and so-called social and social dumping. It should be stressed that cabotage is regulated by a separate Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council and that infringements in cabotage do not give rise to a loss of good repute by the carrier, as they have no direct link with road safety.  When we talk about social issues, we need to take several aspects into account. Firstly, we have one European Union, we have a common market, but we also have significant differences in the level of remuneration for the same work in the different countries of the European Union. Secondly, it must not be forgotten that workers and drivers from one EU or non-EU country are often employed under completely different conditions and far lower rates than those in the European Union country where they work. Thirdly, uncomfortable problems cannot be solved for a country or government at the expense of other countries.

This is the rule that all carriers must follow. The Commission must therefore develop transport legislation capable of regulating unfair practices, respecting competitive principles, combating illegal cabotage and supporting economically and socially staff working in this field. I demand that the rights of all employees be respected, and otherwise EU sanctions should be applied quickly and effectively to discourage any case in which carriers pay their employees less than required by law, employers use fictitious forms of employment, carriers do not pay employees social rights and insurance and employees' working times are not respected.

Isn't that discrimination against smaller transport companies than the rest of the Union?  And another – the issue of non-EU third-country carriers.

It is also necessary to take action against illegal cabotage, as it reflects badly on all carriers legally engaged in cabotage.  Nevertheless, I would like to draw the Commission's attention to the fact that the eradication of so-called social dumping cannot, and indeed is harmful, to start and proceed selectively in certain narrow sectoral policies. Rather, a comprehensive initiative would be needed to speed up the social catch-up of the Member States of Central and Eastern Europe, since the cause should be eliminated, not the symptoms treated. The enforcement and control of the national social legislation of the Member States cannot be taken over by the European Union by an act of delegated powers, as it may ultimately disrupt the unity of the road haulage market, making it more difficult to implement the principles of free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services.

He has pursued transport policy solely under the auspices of his ideological ideas that the big ones should become stronger and that the little ones should disappear in the end – also with the freight companies.  This regulation, which he has proposed here, reflects this idea: little regard for social legislation, reduction of penalties, restriction of penalties. These are all things that those who are small and honestly mean it cannot get around, because they cannot move their seats, cannot hire drivers from all over Europe. The little ones suffer from this, and the big ones benefit. In the end, this means that everyone has less except a few big ones who earn more and more. That is not what we want here, this kind of transport policy. That is why I believe that this will also be rejected and that you will have to come up with a new better proposal. I hope it will be better, and then you will also have the support of this House, which would be very reasonable.

Dear Commissioner, i would like to thank the Rapporteur for her excellent work. I didn't hear you speak, but I know your point of view. I missed a little bit. I am pleased that you are here for your first fire baptuation in this building, in this room. In fact, when we are discussing today the comitology regulation on the classification of serious infringements committed by road hauliers, we are talking about the internal market for road transport. And let us be frank, colleagues, it reminds me very much of the service directive debate here several years ago, in which the political views of employers and workers often coincided depending on the geographical aspect of the European Union. And so is today. We often say that there are no more cases in the delegated act you have submitted. But there is. There are fatigue requirements, there are technical requirements. The fact that there is probably no social dumping is not the availability of so-called illegal cabotage, although in 2009 we decided that this cabotage would be on the road transport market, etc. Here I would like to say a few words in English, knowing that I am in the minority and will be one of the few who will support your proposal, to say a few words at once in English, so that my colleagues perceive my idea well. We'll match it. We have rules here in this House for our local assistants. This is clearly social dumping. It is not admissible that local assistants from Bulgaria should be paid eleven times less than Danish local assistants! So what is this called? It is social dumping. We are pushing our local assistants into a lower quality of life; They are not sleeping very well, their beds are so bad, and they are not eating properly and so on – and they are giving advice to our MEPs! The only good thing is that we MEPs from eastern Europe are not creating a safety hazard for political decisions here. I am, of course, being sarcastic.

We will not achieve our road safety objectives and we will not be able to improve the reputation of the sector without taking into account the social aspects. The human factor is central to our fight for safer roads. Many accidents are due to a lack of attention and reaction from drivers due, in particular, to poor working conditions. The Commission had a real chance, a real opportunity to address the weaknesses in the implementation of the Union's social and labour legislation, as well as the mandate to prevent social dumping, according to Article 6 of Regulation 1071 establishing common rules on the conditions to be met in order to practise the profession of road carrier. The Commission has failed to include illegal coasting transport in its list, which, given its harmful effects on drivers, must undoubtedly be equated with a serious source of offences. I therefore regret that the Commission did not take these problems into account in the development of the list, which remains very vague and has many shortcomings and, as a result, remains unfinished. That is why I have rejected the list proposed in the Committee on Transport and Tourism and I call on my colleagues to vote in favour of our resolution. Nevertheless, we need this list because of the improvements it allows in terms of legal certainty. Transportation companies must take responsibility and, if necessary, ensure that their honour is maintained.

It's not my case; I am going to talk a lot, because the objective of this classification, drawn up by experts for two years, is to harmonise to give legal certainty to carriers crossing Europe from north to south and east to west, and which, because of the discretion of the Member States, do not know what sanctions they face in each country. Thus, there are countries that plan to incorporate and impose prison sentences for those carriers who decide to sleep in the truck's cabin – and not in a motel far from their truck – in uninsured car parks, as has been said recently, and there are other countries for which driving with excess alcohol is not yet a serious violation, with the consequent risk. I therefore find it serious that the non-adoption of this proposal will maintain this discretion and, therefore, the abuses that some authorities exercise against foreign carriers, which are almost always peripherals: those of the East, the West, the South or the North.

The classification of and only infringements of Union rules on road transport, which may lead to a withdrawal of the reliability of a haulier, is undoubtedly the responsibility of the European Commission. The objectives are to create a level playing field, to create legal certainty and to avoid serious road accidents involving fatal and serious injury. In order to make the list presented by the Commission a binding benchmark for assessing reliability, it is necessary, firstly, to remove any remaining ambiguities, secondly, to concentrate on genuinely serious infringements – that is, certain aspects could also be deleted – and, thirdly, missing aspects should be included in the list.

If I recommend today that I vote in favour of the motion for a resolution, which contains the rejection of the Commission's draft regulation, then I am not concerned with a show of strength with the Commission, nor is it about revising the rules on access to the profession of professional driver, nor about opening up cabotage.

As coordinator of the European Socialists in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very grateful that the Committee on Transport and The Commission, including my colleague Ismail Ertug, rejected this List of the Commission. I have been in close contact with lorry drivers, with trade unions, with small and medium-sized enterprises for many years, and what I am experiencing on European roads is a disaster for workers, but also for small and medium-sized enterprises. There are drivers who drive across Europe for EUR 300 a month and – as colleagues have said – sleep in the cabins, spend the day and night in the lorry, and that really borders on modern slavery.  This causes a great deal of anger among those affected and the companies that work legally, which also take the social security of their workers seriously, because they are not up to the pressure, the undercutting pressure. Increasing liberalisation is at the expense of workers, but also at the expense of companies that treat workers properly.  The logistics sector is also showing once again how freedom of competition has been placed above social rights in recent years – and that must change.

It is understandable, of course, that the main focus here has been on problems, because we want to improve the Commission's proposal. It is a serious matter, a catalogue of serious infringements. However, I would like to remind all of us that the objective of free movement of people, goods and services within the European Union is a very important objective in itself. It is worth striving for this together. However, this requires us to have common rules that can also be enforced.  Concerns about road safety have been raised very strongly here. Road safety is exactly what we certainly get the most feedback from entrepreneurs, drivers and also from ordinary citizens who see and experience many dangerous situations in traffic when the rules are ignored or not properly enforced. As far as road safety is concerned, it is important that we have common provisions that are strictly enforced throughout Europe. It is also justified that some countries may have their own regulations. For example, I come from northern Europe myself, and in winter conditions in freezing conditions, it is justified that the countries of northern Europe demand, for example, stricter tyre requirements for trucks. It's about road safety. It is equally important to ensure that we do not accept tax avoidance and the shadow economy. We know that it is easily related to transport, the transport of goods. In fact, transport entrepreneurs themselves strongly support increased controls.

Road transport is the cornerstone of freight transport within the European Union, responsible for more than 70% of all transport and generating nearly 2% of EU GDP. This shows that it is a kind of bloodstream of the single market, without it it would be difficult to talk about the free movement of goods. Despite the great importance for the European economy, numerous barriers to the functioning of companies in this sector remain. Numerous restrictions make it impossible to compete between companies and thus increase the cost of transporting goods. It is estimated that the existing legal situation has a consequence of losses amounting to almost EUR 50 million per year. It is therefore surprising that some governments are calling for further restrictions and the possibility for operators from other Member States to provide domestic transport. If we want to boost the European economy, to increase production and reindustrialise, then we must create the most favourable conditions for the transport of goods. No country will attract investors unless it allows the rapid transport of manufactured goods.  Today's new list of serious road transport regulations prepared by the European Commission must be carefully considered so as not to lead to the collapse of transport companies, and precise enough to prevent some Member States from overinterpreting it. The use of excessive controls for protectionist purposes will not only undermine the implementation of the internal road transport market and lead to a loss of its potential, but will also further create an antagonistic climate in the international provision of transport services.  We all want to improve the level of professional qualifications of carriers and thus to improve safety on EU roads. The common rules for the classification of serious infringements of Union rules, which may lead to a loss of good repute by the road transport operator, should therefore be very precise and constitute a reference for national control systems.

I can only be disappointed by the project presented today. Disappointed by this proposed regulation, which is both incomplete, vague and inconsistent. As an example, let me mention some of its shortcomings: it does not sanction illegal cabotage and, as a result, tolerates social dumping in the transport sector, which endangers the employment of employees and the existence of many companies which, in turn, work properly. This classification does not effectively combat social fraud, which we know leads to unacceptable working and safety conditions and genuine distortions of competition. Nowhere does this classification mention weekly rest in the vehicle. These serious deficiencies can lead to serious accidents or worse: fatal accidents. We cannot accept endangering the lives of workers and road users! These shortcomings are all the more regrettable because the social partners, the representatives of both employees and employers, had agreed on a common contribution. Unfortunately, despite the commission's direction, it seems that the importance that should be given to the opinion of the social partners has not been given due consideration. Today, it seems to me to be really important that the Commission should look again at this classification, with the help of the social partners.

Illegal cabotage is a serious infringement in the context of fair competition. Member States are obliged to penalise it and consider it when assessing good repute. However, it is not part of this classification, where seriousness of infringement is defined on the basis of risk of fatalities or serious injuries. Cabotage infringement is not linked to such a road-safety risk. I would also like to point out that, when assessing good repute, Member States should, however, also consider infringements against the national social rules, including those on pay and employment conditions.

The process has been going on for some time and during the Cypriot and Greek Presidencies, which have promoted Council discussions on this issue, they have paved the way for the result achieved during the Italian Presidency. But the process is not yet complete, i.e. it must start operationally now. This point has been discussed on several occasions. I believe that we can now say, Commissioner, that there is broad political consensus on the need to establish structured long-term cooperation in the field of research and innovation in the Mediterranean area. The ITRE Parliamentary Committee, which I represent here, has put an oral question on prima's proposal under Article 185, because it considers that the subject matter of this initiative is of strategic importance for the current situation and, above all, for the development of the Mediterranean area and relations between the European Union and the Mediterranean. We all understand that, if this issue was important in 2012, when he was born in Barcelona, today it is even more important, precisely because there have been historical passages in these regions that will mark history, both in the context of an evolution and an involution, sometimes, of the countries of that area. We therefore need an effort on the part of the European Union, an effort to invest more, in these regions, in these countries and to do so precisely in the field of research and innovation, because we all know – we all say this for Europe but it applies equally to the other regions – that research and innovation are powerful levers of development but also of social, cultural, as well as economic and productive transformation. These are key factors, in short, of the capacity for growth and growth in a qualified and socially and environmentally positive direction, as far as development is concerned. This is how the idea of PRIMA was born, a partnership for research and innovation in the Mediterranean, an initiative under Article 185 that provides for structuring and implementation within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean, which has borne little fruit in recent years but which could find here a very useful and very important field of application. Now, the proposal has been developed with the identification of a shared scientific programme, joint programming, which is based on two axes, two pillars, i.e. inextricably linked: water resources and food systems, combined in the sense of safety, health and sustainability, issues that are also at the heart of many European policies, themes that also recall the next Expo in Milan , a world event held in Europe. The effects on the economic and productive structure are obvious to everyone. This programme, clearly defined its objective, aims to develop innovative solutions and promote their application, therefore research and innovations to be applied immediately in production systems, by end users, first and foremost farmers, to improve the efficiency and sustainability of food production and water resources. The programme has gathered an impressive critical mass of accessions: 14 countries which have also committed themselves to financial support for the programme and, in essence, to hosting any organizational locations, etc. I would say that, to date, it is estimated that the financial commitment made by the countries concerned is already in the order of EUR 200 million. Therefore, a great commitment to which Europe should contribute with an equally significant effort. I would say that this is an important programme, which could be the foundation stone of a new partnership between Europe and the Mediterranean. There is a lot of talk about this need for cooperation when we deal with major issues that are also linked to stability throughout the region and to many security prospects. We ask you, Commissioner, what you intend to do, what your programme is, what your proposals are, reminding you of a few points. We are asking for this initiative on the basis of Article 185 because we want Parliament to have a role, a voice, a joint decision on this programme. But I come back to a few points that I would like to refer to: a structured programme means structured research, which has meaning, coordination and logic, not fragmented and fragmented, which are an organic programme, capable of having future results. We call for clear and effective governance: effective in the implementation and also in the results, in the application, therefore a very clear technical-institutional responsibility and finally an adequate and medium-term financial commitment, because programmes of this kind do not they can start and stop but they have to give stability and security.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 142, "date": "2014-12-15.json", "name": "Carlos Moedas", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "  Member of the Commission. - Mr President, honourable Members, I am very pleased to be here with you today for what is my first intervention in the plenary as the Commissioner for Research, Science and Innovation. In my statement during my hearing, I committed to engaging in an open dialogue and to maintaining close contact with the Members of this House in order to ensure that the channels of communication are always open. In this context, I welcome the opportunity to have an exchange of views with you on the issue raised in your oral question. Firstly, I would like to stress that the Commission fully recognises the crucial importance of Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in research and innovation. Research and innovation are key elements for developing a stronger partnership for democracy and shared prosperity with our southern neighbours. Secondly, I would like to acknowledge all the work performed over the last two and half years by the EU Member States and their Southern Mediterranean partners, which led to the Council conclusion of 5 September, which I supported on behalf of the Commission. Particular thanks go to the Italian Presidency for its strong engagement, and, in particular, to Minister Giannini. Thirdly, Parliament too has also shown strong interests in Euro-Mediterranean cooperation, and I personally remember very well the three questions I received during my hearing: one from Ms Toia, one from Mr Blanco López and the other from Mr Borrelli – three members of the ITRE Committee – on the importance of the PRIMA initiative.  More recently, I had the opportunity to address the PRIMA topic at the structured dialogue I had in the ITRE Committee on 4 December. I am therefore perfectly aware that those co-legislators attach great importance to Euro-Mediterranean cooperation – as does the Commission. The chosen approach of focusing on food systems and water resources has the potential to contribute to addressing key challenges in the region. In particular, addressing the water/food nexus in relation to the specificities of the Mediterranean context may have added value for existing research and innovation activities and networks.  Now that I have addressed the content aspect, which in my view prevails over the rest, I cannot conclude without a word on the procedure, due to the specific reference to Article 185. Concerning your specific questions, I would first of all like to reassure you and confirm to you that once the Commission formally receives the joint programme proposal from the PRIMA group, it will carefully assess it and evaluate the best way forward – including the Article 185 option. Firstly, it goes without saying that any initiative will necessarily be built on – and avoid overlaps with – other ongoing initiatives in order to integrate efforts in a coherent way, to pool resources in a sustainable way and to take account of the long-term perspective. These should be the primary concerns. It is necessary to have a deep knowledge of the work that has been done before or is currently in progress in that field so that we can build on it and deliver on a winning partnership. This is now even more the case due to the new approach announced by President Juncker regarding better and smarter regulation, the aim of which is to reduce the administrative burden, especially for businesses, to ensure that the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality are respected, and to ensure that that EU legislation is actually fit for purpose and creates favourable conditions for economic development. Secondly, a mature, well-focused proposal from the Member States is a prerequisite for the Commission in order to assess the participation of the Union in the programme and determine the way forward. We will therefore check whether the proposal, firstly, has clear objectives and is relevant to the objectives of Horizon 2020 and the broader Union policies; secondly, this proposal should be proven to have EU added value in a critical mass; thirdly, there should be a sound financial commitment from the participating countries. All the points that I have just mentioned mean that the Commission takes the initiative seriously and will analyse the joint programme proposal in an in-depth manner. It should not be understood as a way to rule out any possibility, or, in this case, Article 185. Let me be clear with you: I want to proceed, but in a way that would be most effective in helping us to achieve our shared objective of strengthening Euro-Mediterranean cooperation. For this reason, it is premature at this stage to provide a timeline for the process to be undertaken before we have made an initial assessment of the joint programme and before we have determined whether the Commission will launch a legislative proposal as a result. Let me finish by saying that the Commission recognises that the recent developments in the Southern Neighbourhood are challenging. These make it even more important to deploy all instruments at our disposal for cooperation in research and innovation.

The comments made by Mrs Toia on the agreement, on the programme, on the possibility of developing research and innovation through the PRIMA project in the Mediterranean basin, cannot but meet with my most convinced support and my request for effective and effective cooperation, including through the Commission's concrete presence in this programme. A presence which, as far as we are concerned, must obviously also be of an economic nature, and I refer entirely to the rigour and punctuality with which you referred just now to the way in which the Commission normally has to decide, how and how much to intervene in support of proposals such as this. Action is not taken for emotional reasons: action is taken for specific reasons and on the basis of a path that in the medium and long term provides genuine possibilities for development. Well, the case of the Mediterranean basin and the case of research and innovation are cases which, in my opinion, certainly meet these criteria, with particular reference to the particular arguments raised by Mr Beazley. Toia, in particular the subject of food and water. The issue of water is a central issue, it is an issue on which our people will have a great deal to work on in the future and it is a central point for concentrating development opportunities in those countries that need it. We, as Europeans, have developed entrepreneurial skills, development and research skills on these issues, and we cannot fail to transfer them. From this point of view, we cannot fail to have ad hoc programmes. It is right, I think it is right to recall the comment made by the Italian Minister Giannini, which you also mentioned, which, with regard to the PRIMA programme, spoke of a sort of Horizon 2020 located territorially, specifically oriented towards a specific area, as in this case.  These are eight countries in the European area bordering the Mediterranean, including my own country, Italy, and there are nine countries in the Asian and African area that are waiting to be able to be genuinely involved. Nothing better from a cultural, educational and economic point of view than to rebuild and implement the strength of this basin, of the Mediterranean basin, through the theme of research and innovation.

After two years of work, we can consider that this initiative is mature enough to make the leap towards a public-public partnership programme based on Article 185 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. And my group would like to stress the importance of strongly supporting this initiative, for a number of reasons. Firstly, because it recognizes the value of science as an instrument of dialogue, exchange and cooperation. Secondly, because it allows us to integrate efforts to find solutions to social challenges together such as those involved in this initiative: food systems and water resources, so important to the South. And thirdly, because investing together in research and innovation allows us to improve employment and living conditions in the Mediterranean and promote sustainable and inclusive growth in these regions. Commissioner, we must revalue the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership's agenda with our Mediterranean neighbours ready to participate and co-finance activities.

In addition, food security from land and marine resources is threatened by pollution, overexploitation and limited availability of fertile land. Demographic and urbanization trends also put pressure on natural resources, while changes in lifestyle and nutritional habits increasingly lead to eating disorders. The PRIMA initiative pursues innovative solutions to improve the efficiency and sustainability of food production, as well as water supply, avoiding food-related diseases. This ambitious objective responds to priority challenges for Mediterranean countries by promoting good social and individual health, access to food and water, and the well-being of people, while fostering sustainable socio-economic growth. In addition, the PRIMA initiative, inseparable from the great Mediterranean capital which is Barcelona, will be a valuable instrument in establishing long-term structured cooperation in the field of research and innovation in the European Union and the associated Mediterranean countries. There is already a political dialogue, as the initiative has involved partner countries from the outset, and several countries, on both sides of the Mediterranean, have already indicated what they want their financial contribution to be. This programme can play an important role in supporting European diplomacy and neighbourhood policy by reflecting the principles of reciprocity, solidarity and co-development, while promoting the stability of European borders.

In the light of the specificities of each country, cooperation in research and innovation should aim to address important social challenges to enhance social well-being. Projects focusing, as has been mentioned and the objective, on food and water systems should therefore be promoted, but we believe that energy sources, such as renewable energy sources, should also be used – and when we talk about the Mediterranean, this is important. It should also be ensured that Euro-Mediterranean cooperation in the field of research and innovation is beneficial and efficient, based on the principles of mutual interest, common benefit and respect for human rights.

We are therefore waiting for a complete proposal from the Commission on how to implement the PRIMA initiative, and we would like in this regard to make three specific recommendations.  Firstly, PRIMA should relate not only to the countries in the Mediterranean area but to the Mediterranean itself. I think PRIMA should also address the challenges of the blue economy, ensuring the sustainability of its actions. The objective of PRIMA should be to focus research and innovation towards sustainably exploiting aquatic living resources while at the same time protecting biodiversity, ecosystem services and the resource base. Secondly, PRIMA must focus on food production systems that foster sustainable production of safe and healthy food in vibrant local economies. The common research and initiative priorities must be focused towards a low energy, low external input, low emission and low waste economy, and support the creation of vibrant local economies and assure food production supply chains.  Thirdly and finally, support for an Article 185 initiative with a dedicated implementing structure. We believe that the PRIMA initiative has today all the prerequisites to be established as a public-public partnership under Article 185 of the Treaty.

In the meantime, the countries of southern Europe have suffered greatly from both the entry into force of the single currency and austerity policies. We will therefore give full support to the partnership for research and innovation in the Mediterranean area, but clarifications are needed. A Mediterranean New Deal cannot but be accompanied by extreme rigour: and rigour does not mean the inhuman and ineffective rigour of austerity but rigour over the legitimate and appropriate use of European funds, in many Member States where corruption is rampant, and strict compliance with the regulations on the real participation of stakeholders and NGOs.

The European Union can probably play a facilitator role and that is why I do not see any problem with the European Union participating in this partnership for research and innovation. My country, France, has already committed to participate in the PRIMA initiative to the tune of 4 million euros per year. If this money is used well, it can be useful to the South Mediterranean populations, who regularly face severe food and access difficulties due to a great dual, climatic and political instability. Nevertheless, I draw your attention to the fact that these cooperations must be beneficial to all parties, which is implied by the very idea of a partnership. Among the counterparties we are entitled to demand from our partners is the necessary control of migratory flows. This question, you will agree, is not incidental.

Over the past ten years, a number of cooperation networks have been established, both at the State/State level and at the regional level, and significant results have been achieved in the construction of a Common Euro-Mediterranean research and innovation area. In April 2012, the Euro-Mediterranean Conference on Research and Innovation, organized by the Commission in Barcelona, called for a renewed partnership in research and innovation. In addition, and mentioned here, the Cypriot, Greek and Italian Presidencies of the Council supported this initiative because of the potential for significant improvement of the European Union's scientific cooperation with the southern Mediterranean States. It is almost impossible — and surely we share it — to separate R&amp;D&amp;I from higher education, as it is in this area that it is possible to make faster progress in collaboration between different States, using, for example, joint studies, joint master's degrees, mobility programmes, students, master's degrees, phDs, mixed university centres, among others. The PRIMA initiative is based on the principles of co-ownership, common interest and shared benefit, all of which are necessary to ensure the sustainable management of common resources and shared regional responsibility within the framework of the Union for the Mediterranean. Concrete solutions must be provided to the common problems we face. It is good that the European Commission has recognised the potential of the partnership for research and innovation in the Mediterranean for all the States that make up it, as well as for the citizens of both sides of the Mediterranean. In order to achieve the success of this important partnership, it is important that the Commission has Article 185 of the Treaty on the table to provide high visibility, institutional stability and the long-term commitment of the participating countries. We believe that the Article 185 initiative is the most appropriate tool to address the overall challenges of the Mediterranean region in an integrated way, so it must be implemented — or should be implemented — as soon as possible. In any case, Commissioner, I share that the objective is important more than the process: it is more important what is how. But surely you share with me that it is also important that the search for how not to jeopardize what, does not jeopardize the objectives.

The Mediterranean is currently experiencing very important problems, and it is also in this House that we continue to discuss how to solve, for example, the problem of immigration but also that of unemployment. I am convinced that this instrument will make a great contribution. I therefore ask you to proceed without delay in the application of Article 185 of the Treaty, which will contribute to the internal stability of the area through dialogue and dialogue in the field of research and innovation. I will end by saying that, as responsible for the EPP on youth policies, I am also convinced that research and innovation are the element in giving positivity and optimism to young people, who also see their future as personal and country improvement. I am also thinking of Ispra, the European research centre that resides in my province and which I invite you to visit, if it has not already done so, because it can be a springboard for a Union and a Mediterranean partnership, which we are already playing at home and which we can strengthen.", "language": "en", "original_language": "it", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 156, "date": "2014-12-15.json", "name": "Monika BEŇOVÁ", "mepid": "23868", "text": "   Demographic, socio-economic challenges, but also environmental issues, are very closely linked to this subject.

I have had the opportunity to attend several meetings in recent months on the assessment of mediterranean fishing waters. All of them were unanimous in concluding that there is a lack of knowledge about the populations, biology and ecology of commercially exploited species. In my view, this is not due to the lack of research and innovation, but to the lack of coordination and transparency in international scientific cooperation with third countries. Mediterranean marine research institutes are excellent and research vessels are at the level of what we find in other major sea basins, but the functioning of international scientific management organisations such as the Barcelona Convention and the Commission for Mediterranean Science has shown that there are geographical-political barriers. In the Mediterranean context, we must focus on north-south cooperation based on dialogue and data transparency. The Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Region will fall far short if southern countries of this great basin are lacking. There are good examples of the application of Article 181 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, such as the BONUS project in the Baltic Sea. But the Baltic is very different from the Mediterranean, has a more diverse political geography. I take this opportunity to draw attention to enlargement, or the second suez canal. This process will result in increased maritime pollution, including many alien species. The expected impact goes far beyond the promoter country, having consequences throughout the Mediterranean, as it has, and has, the current Suez Canal.  For this reason, I call for a real environmental impact study that is holistic, comprehensive, profound, international and, more importantly, consequential.

Policy-making for the Mediterranean began immediately after the creation of the European Union, but more concrete changes were lacking until the early 1990s and the famous Barcelona process. The past two decades have passed in the sign of numerous activities, but with no visible results. Conflicts in the southern Mediterranean are multiplying, the problem of migration remains not uniquely regulated, and countries involved in Euro-Mediterranean programmes have not prospered excessively, as the most commonly changed form, but not the content of policies.  Given the approach so far, we inevitably wonder whether the European Union's policy towards the Mediterranean targets democratisation or is more similar to polarisation policies and what are the possible options for getting out of the current situation? One of them is certainly the PRIMA programme already supported by countries on both sides of the Mediterranean and the Competitiveness Council. Even an adequate legal framework has been found in the form of Article 185 of the European Commission. treaty on the functioning of the European Union.  Mediterranean policies so far have been based on a centralized top-down approach from the north to the south coast of the Mediterranean. Perhaps the solution lies in changing the approach and focusing on citizens, scientists, research centers, small and medium-sized entrepreneurs who would really connect both coasts. This would also create an opportunity for action for non-European Mediterranean countries and develop the potential for their joint scientific cooperation to achieve what previous approaches and policies have failed to do.

In many European countries, the way and amount of support for minority cultures is guaranteed by law. For example, it is defined as a fixed percentage of the respective state budget or national gross domestic product. The allocation of funds is left to the stakeholders themselves. This could be the solution throughout the European Union, because it would greatly improve the relationship between the majority and the minority, and minority NGOs and cultural institutions would not be subject to financial blackmail and could not be easily used as a political tool.
