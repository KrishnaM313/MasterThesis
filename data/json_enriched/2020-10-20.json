Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has  There is a time for discussion. There is also a right time for compromise, and there is also a right time for decisions. Right, the reform has been discussed for a long time. You could say that the reform was introduced by Phil Hogan in 2018. For information to our younger colleagues, that was our then Commissioner for Agriculture. Mrs Herranz accompanied the dossier until the election, and after the 2019 election, we started a wide-ranging debate. We wanted to reach a major compromise with our colleague from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Energy, but unfortunately the chairman of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Social Affairs cancelled these discussions. Now there is a package on the table, and honestly, I would have done the reform very differently. This is the same for my colleague, Mrs Noichl, Mr Lavlavsek, Häusling, Bert-Jan Ruissen and all the other rapporteurs. Everyone had their own ideas and would do much, much better. Of course, we need to formulate group positions, but we are here above all to find compromises. That requires courage. Meckering is always easier than helping, and that is why I would ask all the political groups to be courageous and agree to the compromise. On the substance, 30% are reserved for the so-called eco-schemes, 35% of the second pillar for environmental and climate measures. Flexibility between the two pillars is given for environmentally relevant measures. 30% of the investment is earmarked for investment in climate and environmental measures. We have increased conditionality, legumes in crop rotation, definitions of water protection margins, the land should be green all year round, every farmer must keep 5% of his agricultural area free of fertilisers and plant protection products. At Member State level, by the way, this figure should be 10%, and we have a completely new style. It is to be changed from a previously action-oriented model to a goal-oriented model, and this creates the necessary freedom for the Member States if the target is achieved. That is why we are once again appealing to all Members who are perhaps dissatisfied in detail: the really important thing will then be this national strategic plan, and there we must quite simply help to ensure that the Member States also seize the opportunity and that there is less bureaucracy for European farmers. That is why we are once again appealing – including to all the critics – to give the reform a chance in the interests of the environment, in the interests of climate protection, and above all in the interests of European farmers. They need planning certainty. We have decided on a two-year transition period to put this new Deliver model into practice.  This model must not only be adopted, it must not only be coordinated with Brussels, it must also be understood by practice.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has said. After two years of intensive work, we are finally coming to a vote on the common agricultural policy. We must take a clear position in this vote and refer to the ten million farmers we have within Europe. They need a future perspective and planning security.  Unfortunately, there has been and is a lot of negative sentiment about what farmers should do for society and what society's performance is worth. What is clear is that we need our farming families and strong economic areas in all regions of Europe – I stress farming families. 8.5 million holdings are smaller than seventeen hectares. These farmers rely on us and provide us with the highest quality food every day.  It is precisely in the period of the Corona pandemic that the population – especially in the wealthy Member States – has probably been thinking about security of supply for the first time in a long time. We are now setting a practical and workable framework for the common agricultural policy, and it needs pragmatic and sensible approaches and must not be seen as ideologically driven in the management of agriculture and food. The CAP has been an important brace of our region for decades and an important brace within Europe. 'Unity in diversity' is our motto and this is now also reflected in this new future common agricultural policy. For me, in my report, there were four important issues and large blocs: what should the future agricultural policy look like? Firstly, the people in the regions know best how to shape the framework in the national strategic plans. That is why the approach is right to enshrine more flexibility for the Member States and to abolish the 'one size fits all' principle. This means that agriculture and forestry as a profession and the rural population must be actively involved in the preparation of national strategic plans in European countries.  Secondly, to shift more responsibility to the Member States, but at the same time to maintain a genuine common agricultural policy, is an important step forward for me. The consistent implementation of the single audit principle – that is, the elimination of double auditing – relieves the burden on the Member States and thus also on farmers. At the same time, reporting actual results on the basis of europe-wide key figures results in a fair and transparent implementation of the objectives of the CAP.  Thirdly, our farmers are already doing a great deal to promote biodiversity, soil protection and water protection and climate protection in addition to the supply of food. This requires feasible, regionally tailored concepts plus training and further education with the latest scientific status. This is the great opportunity of the supply model and the eco-schemes and the common opportunity to create incentives to reward farmers who implement the best possible economic methods on their farms in their regions. In Bavaria, one in three hectares is in environmental programmes – and this must not be jeopardised in the second pillar.  Fourthly, in some Member States, the implementation and control of EU funding is difficult, either due to weak administrative structures or a lack of transparency. This complaint mechanism, which we are introducing for farmers, is an important step towards this.  I believe that the report I have presented on funding, administration and control will enable us to respond adequately to the challenges in society.

Mr President, Commissioner, there is much to be said about the way this reform of the common agricultural policy is presented, but I will of course only present and address the report for which I am responsible, which is the report on the common organisation of markets. The common organisation of the markets: these three words have never been so topical. The health crisis we are experiencing is a reminder, if needed, that the invisible hand of the market does not exist, Mr President, that markets cannot self-regulate, that all this is a decoy and that the regulation or regulations are there to improve the functioning of markets. Agricultural markets are structurally unstable, that is a fact. We must ensure a fairer and more stable income for our farmers in order to support them in the future green transition, and the common organisation of markets is there above all to better manage crises. We need to be effective. Yes, the markets are unstable: it is a fact, but it is not inevitable. It is for this reason, Commissioner, that we must put the Commission at the centre of the scheme. It is for this reason that the Commission must remain the guarantor of market integrity in the face of crises, that it must fully play its role as sector regulator - and this is our first proposal: sectoral regulator in agriculture. Like any management authority, it must establish an action strategy within a performance framework, based on monitoring indicators and results. It must therefore be assessed every year and be accountable to Parliament and the Council. In order for the Commission to play its role effectively as sector regulator, we propose to create a single European observatory for agricultural markets, which will have to collect more information, not just on milk and sugar, but on all sectors - this is the novelty. It should improve transparency and thus trigger early warnings in order to put in place appropriate management tools: assistance to private storage of course, public storage as a last resort, voluntary withdrawals that have been proposed unanimously by the groups involved. But also, Mr President, Commissioner, we are going to propose with my group - and I thank my President Iratxe Garcia Pérez - the mandatory withdrawal. The idea is to allow the Commission to decide on mandatory withdrawal in the event of a serious crisis. I will call on you to vote en masse on this amendment, because it will regulate production in the event of a serious crisis. By your vote, ladies and gentlemen, you will also be able to secure organic producers. If we are to reach 25% of the area in organic farming by 2030, we need to secure farmers and guarantee them a price level so that they can make their transition. That is what we are proposing in Amendment 274, also tabled by my group. In the event of a market crisis, the European Union will have to pay for the differential between the price of the organic product and the price of the product from conventional agriculture. Among other measures, it is imperative that import quotas for favourable duty products respect social and environmental conditions. Imported products that do not meet EU production standards will be banned outright. As for viticulture, as you know, this sector is hard hit by the health crisis: it had to be given opportunities. We also propose the extension of planting permits until 2050 and a simplification of the procedure to modify the specifications of protected appellations of origin. And to allow the sector to adapt to the evolution of consumption, we will allow wines below 8.5 degrees to be wines, so that this fringe of the market does not escape the sector of viticulture. This is an important issue. Finally, to enable consumers to fully understand what they are ingesting, particularly with regard to viticulture products, as for solid foods, we will propose a labeling indicating the calories and what is in the wine bottle, that is, the list of ingredients, either on the bottle or in a dematerialized way. This is also the case with the future of the wine industry, and I wanted to highlight that. Another step forward seems important to me: all products under protected origin will be able to collectively adapt their production to demand. What is possible today for wine, cheese and ham only can now be applied to all sectors. If I take the example of the county in France, we see how this sector can regulate production since it controls the whole sector from the upstream to the downstream, which is also important to do with force. Finally, we propose to improve the functioning of producer organisations and inter-professional organisations, and to strengthen them. This is imperative so that farmers can seek more value. It is through more collective action, not individualism and opportunism, that they will do better tomorrow. I would also like to say a few words about the name of meats. Commissioner, there is a gap in European legislation on this issue. It is necessary to properly inform the consumer, but also to allow vegetable proteins to develop as well as animal proteins. We will therefore have to complete the European legislation. That is the purpose of Amendment 275, which deals with section 78, and that we are proposing to you, again, with my group. It is important to maintain equity between plant and animal proteins. In conclusion, I would like, Mr President, Commissioner, to thank all the shadow rapporteurs and all the teams who participated in our work and have done an excellent job and, thus, the development of a report which will undoubtedly give economic prospects for the future of European agriculture.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Social democrats"}, {"id": 7, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Christophe HANSEN", "mepid": "193419", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety.

We are at a crucial moment in the process towards the new common agricultural policy. Both the Council, negotiating the general approach at this very moment in Luxembourg, and the European Parliament here in Brussels are finalising their respective mandates and preparing to enter the decisive stage of trilogues.  It is important for our farmers and our farming community to have clarity on the legal framework for the years to come. We need a strong common agricultural policy to ensure that European agriculture can continue to provide economic, environmental and social benefits for our farmers and citizens in the future. This includes the delivery of stronger environmental and climate ambitions, as set out in the Green Deal and the farm to fork strategy.  I welcome the fact that many honourable Members agree with this basic orientation for the future common agricultural policy. However, I note that some amendments do not share our ambition for a greener and fairer CAP. Let me briefly turn now to the individual proposals to mention a few key points about the Strategic Plan Regulation. If we want to achieve the objectives of the European Green Deal, it is essential that the key elements of its green architecture are maintained or further strengthened in the future CAP. This is especially essential if we want the CAP to contribute in a credible manner with 40% of its spending to the 30% overall climate objective of the EU budget.  Let me now highlight the main building blocks of our green architecture and where we stand in this respect. Regarding conditionality, the foundation of the future environmental ambition comes from the proposed enhanced conditionality, including the good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAEC) applicable to all farmers as a condition for receiving full direct payment. Strong GAECs are essential for reaching the climate and environmental goals established by the European Green Deal. This is particularly true for GAEC 9, which is key to the success of the biodiversity strategy. The proposal to reduce the scope of this GAEC to arable land only will not be sufficient to reach our targets. While I agree that the problem may be more acute on arable land, such an approach is counterproductive in halting the loss of biodiversity because other types of agricultural land should also contribute to the biodiversity targets. Allowing farmers to fulfil their obligation with respect to biodiversity by simply not spraying pesticides and fertiliser on 5% of their arable land, regardless of the crops, would be a step backwards compared with the current situation. This would not contribute to our biodiversity strategy. Regarding the eco-schemes, these are key and they are designed to make a difference and incentivise farmers to maintain and adopt the practices necessary for the green transition. The Commission strongly supports an ambitious and credible ring-fencing of eco-schemes and welcomes the amendment in this respect. The Commission is, at the same time, fully aware of the risk that some funding could be left unspent if farmers do not sign up to these measures in sufficient numbers, especially in the first years. We share these concerns and are ready to explore possible solutions, such as making ring-fencing in Pillar 1 more flexible or taking on board higher efforts made under Pillar 2 on the environmental objectives. Any flexibility must be compatible with the high environmental and climate ambition and the 40% spending target to which I referred previously.  In that sense, when considering eco-schemes, let’s keep in mind that it is not only about ambitious budget allocations. The quality of eco-schemes is equally essential to delivering our environmental and climate ambition.  During my recent exchange with the members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development (AGRI), we discussed a non-exhaustive list of possible eco-schemes. We are ready to continue working with the co-legislator in this area, while acknowledging that Member States should be able to design eco-schemes best adapted to their specific needs and circumstances.  Another layer in our environmental ambition concerns the ring-fencing of 30% of the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) budget for agro-environmental measures. We now see attempts to include payments to areas with natural constraints (ANCs) and with limited environmental contribution, as shown by recent evaluations, in this ring-fencing. This is not credible. The European Court of Auditors has rightly criticised this. We are aware of this. This would be backsliding from the current situation where at EU level we are spending 35% on the environment and climate under the Agricultural Fund for Rural Development without ANC payments. If the finally proposed ring-fencing of 35% were to include 40% of ANC payments, this would be a step backwards compared with today. We have to be serious about the new environmental ambition of the CAP and, therefore, we are determined to count under the ring-fencing only payments for farmers or other beneficiaries who do more for the environment than simply respecting baseline obligations. This is not the case of ANC payments.  Please allow me to make one final comment on the Strategic Plan Regulation and the performance review. To ensure the CAP delivers on its core objectives and the Green Deal objectives, we need the right performance indicators and a regular review. If it is to have a credible mechanism to defend publicly the added value of the CAP, the Commission needs the means to adequately monitor and, if necessary, take action against those Member States lagging behind. Ideally, we need a yearly review covering all results indicators included in the CAP plan. A strong monitoring system and the means to steer implementation will allow the Commission to report regularly and comprehensively to the European Parliament, ensuring transparency and enabling public scrutiny.  Regarding the new delivery model and the horizontal regulation proposed by Ms Müller, I note that the Commission proposal for the new common agricultural policy is based on the premise that it is working well. There is continuity from the current period in the structure and role of the governance bodies. The Commission proposal clearly states that the Member States must deliver on performance and have a robust governance system in place, such as paying agencies as part of the integrated administration and control system and the land parcel identification system. This will ensure sound financial management. Member States will check eligibility at beneficiary level. This does not mean that there will be no controls in the future. Moreover, the Commission can take appropriate measures if national control systems are not operational. We will still have a robust assurance model. However, detailed eligibility rules set at the level of the Union requirements would create a system where Member States would have to report on compliance on top of performance and the Commission would have to audit the detailed rules. This two-layer system – compliance and performance-based – would entail an unbearable administrative burden for the Member States. A two-layer system, together with the amendments proposed on the performance review and the performance clearance, may prevent the Member States from timely delivery on performance. Finally, on the Common Market Organisation (CMO) Regulation and Mr Andrieu’s report on the proposal, in its 2018 proposal, the Commission maintained the architecture and main features of the current CMO. It is my firm conviction that we should avoid reverting to the old CAP with permanent intervention in markets with automatic triggers of crisis measures that would blow market signals and annihilate the market orientation given to the policy since the 1990s. Market intervention instruments have been successfully triggered in a flexible and timely manner in previous years, together with the possibility for the Commission to adopt exceptional measures whenever needed. Introducing new compulsory procedural steps would weaken and slow down the ability of the European Union to respond to any agricultural market crises. Exceptional measures should respect the same principles of market orientation, avoiding the reintroduction of production quotas.  In relation to the wine package, we are open to discuss some of the amendments, but the duration of our current vine-planting authorisation scheme, introduced in 2016, should not be changed as it would be premature to extract any conclusions today. The regime is due to be reassessed in 2023. Panie Przewodniczący! Jeszcze raz dziękuję za wspólną pracę, za konstruktywną współpracę. Jestem przekonany, że tworzymy reformę, która uczyni rolnictwo europejskie bardziej przyjaznym dla środowiska, dla klimatu, dla dobrostanu zwierząt, ale również reformę, która uczyni rolnictwo europejskie bardziej odpornym na kryzysy.

It was huge. Dear colleagues, it is our great responsibility to adopt such a reform of the common agricultural policy, which will enable European farmers to continue to provide healthy, quality and affordable food for Europeans. We must provide farmers with decent income for their work and an equivalent position in the food chain.  We must further support small farms that are abandoning farming very quickly. The average age of European farmers is over 57 years, so I welcome the measures that support young takers. However, we must not forget the social situation of those who surrender the farm.  I support measures that promote knowledge transfer, digitisation of agricultural production and measures in support of the concept of smart villages. These are measures that will enable the settlement of Europe's rural areas.  Farmers have been the ones we should thank for the landscape and environmental protection.  In the future, more funding is foreseen under the green architecture of the common agricultural policy, for protecting the environment and combating climate change, the consequences of which are first felt by farmers.  In any case, the basic function of agriculture remains to produce enough food for farmers to have a decent income, and we must therefore support farmers who actually produce food through basic payment and production-linked payments.", "language": "en", "original_language": "sl", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 10, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Younous OMARJEE", "mepid": "30482", "text": "  rapporteur for the opinion of the Committee on Regional Development.

Mr President, Commissioner, the common agricultural policy allows an entire profession to carry out the noblest of tasks: to ensure a food supply of affordable and quality products for our citizens, but also to participate in the development of our rural areas. As a member of the EPP Group's negotiating team on this reform, I know how difficult and sometimes frustrating the negotiation process has been in recent months. Nevertheless, an agreement was reached. The gradual integration of environmental and climate issues into the common agricultural policy is one of the hallblys of its evolution. Nevertheless, let us not give in to the excess in this area by promoting political totems and big figures outside of any concrete reality. I prefer to rely on the ground and the truth is that farmers have not waited for us to engage in the transition of their practices and we must support them through incitement rather than coercion, through accompaniment rather than through sanctions. While the CAP's environmental and climate ambition is strengthened by this agreement, it also ensures a balance between these objectives and income support for farmers and the economic development of the sectors. Ladies and gentlemen, we have fought in recent months to ensure that the common agricultural policy remains a tool for agricultural economics, as this policy is essential to support European sectors in their development, their structuring but also to help them cope with the globalisation of trade. We have introduced new operational programmes, revised the rules on tools for cooperation between farmers, secured the missions of inter-professionals in relation to the application of competition law, strengthened supply management tools for quality products and, finally, permanently extended the system of planting permits until 2050.  Similarly, we have fought to reform the crisis reserve to make it more operational and to set up a European observatory to improve market transparency and enable the Union to intervene quickly in the event of a major crisis. Finally, an ecological barrier is introduced through the ban on entry into the European market of products that do not comply with our health and environmental standards. Colleagues, one of the main challenges of the reform is also the maintenance of the common character of the common agricultural policy. If the CAP is to be flexible in order to adapt to the realities of European territories, it is essential to maintain a strong common ground, otherwise we will go towards 27 divergent European agricultural policies and we will not be able to guarantee equal treatment between farmers.  Parliament has also committed itself against this deadly trend of the European idea.

They closed the companies, closed the offices, closed the schools. Europe stopped, but we were able, through the impetus of work and the commitment of our primary sector, our farmers and farmers, our farmers and livestock farmers, to ensure food security, to ensure food for our families. Undoubtedly this has been an essential moment to see the importance of the debate that brings us here today, that of a new reform of the common agricultural policy that advances the objective that we have clear from the European institutions: a more environmentally sustainable CAP, more socially sustainable, that is able to ensure food security so as not to depend on outside production and , too, that it is able to guarantee living wages to farmers and farmers. We have been trying for several decades to transform our agriculture to be more in line with our environmental policies and also to ensure that products have a higher quality and safety, with new traceability systems. With each reform we delve into these objectives, but, as we have said, we must try to adapt them to the great diversity that we have in Europe. This text puts environmental architecture at the heart of the reform. The first key is that direct payments will be subject to enhanced conditionality with a clear environmental seal. What until now was optional now becomes the norm. 30% of the pillar will first be reserved for new echoesquemas, a series of new interventions. This will take environmental ambition to unprecedented levels in terms of the budget: 30% in the first pillar of direct aid. In addition, we want to ensure at least 35% in rural development. We don't want it to be an environmental-only policy, we also want it to have a social dimension, and for that it is necessary to ensure that jobs are of quality and that there is a generational renewal. It is necessary to put an end to the generational stopper that exists on farms right now, and therefore the incorporation of young people is essential.  But let us not forget also the importance of women. Our rural environment is totally masculinized. We lose women in rural areas, and when a village loses the last woman living in that town, it's about to disappear. It is therefore essential that we incorporate the gender dimension so that there are policies aimed at women. 95% are small family businesses, and in each area of the European Union they face diverse challenges. That is why national plans must also be adapted to the regional realities we have in Europe at the moment. Agriculture in the European Union is the most diversified in the world, and we are adapting. The CAP is a key pillar of the European Green Pact. The CAP together with the farm-to-table strategy and biodiversity strategy must make our food industry healthier, fairer and more environmentally friendly. And that is why we will continue to work to provide the Union with a legislative framework that goes beyond this CAP, because we need to adapt it to a new reality.

Mr President, farmers should be much less dependent on direct income support. Direct income support is not a measure that structurally improves farmers' competitiveness. Instead, farmers should be given much more opportunity to earn their income from the market. I am therefore also pleased that a proposal of mine has been included in the final compromise text of the European Parliament. I am calling for European competition rules to leave more room for agricultural sustainability initiatives. Of course, agreements in the chain should not lead to prices getting high. This is not in the interests of the consumer, but it is in the interests of the consumer that the products are produced more sustainably. So I believe that the European Competition Authority should also look at this and leave more room in the chain to reach agreements on sustainability, and that the additional costs incurred for a better environment, better animal welfare and a better climate can actually be passed on in the price. A second aspect is greening policy within the common agricultural policy. The European Court of Auditors has been rather critical of this not working. I agree with that and I see that several things need to be adapted. At the moment, generic measures from Brussels are sending farmers to work more sustainably. Only, the differences in Europe are large: in Finland it is snowing at the moment and in Athens it is beautiful weather. The local conditions are not sufficiently considered. And perhaps a bigger problem is that it is only being looked at whether the measures from Brussels have actually been implemented by the farmer and that the effects of these measures on the farm have not been looked at at all.  So we have to do it the other way around. We need to start steering on performance. We need to steer on the results that the individual companies achieve.

The CAP is one of the few European programmes that has worked in recent years and has brought real money to our companies and territories.  I, who have been able to participate in the drafting of this CAP, can say that there have been positive aspects in this reform, but also negative aspects. Well what was done, but much more could have been done. Much more could have been done to cut red tape, which is the first real major problem facing our farmers every day; Much more could have been done not to put the weight of the environmental measures wanted by the European Commission on the shoulders of farmers. It is often forgotten in Brussels that the first guardians of the environment are precisely farmers and that we need agriculture that is environmentally sustainable, but above all economically sustainable. More could be done to defend PDO and PGI products and more could be done in the fight against unfair competition that steals 100 billion euros a year from Made in Italy.  The new CAP also puts new challenges on the table, such as the designation of meat that affects millions of farmers and consumers. There is no meat without meat. Synthetic meat, the one made in the laboratory, inside which there is not a single milligram of meat cannot be called meat. Our farmers and consumers must be protected, not cheated in order to please the interests of some multinationals.  We all know that the real game on the CAP is the one linked to the European budget. The future CAP will be positive or negative depending on how much money will be allocated to agriculture in the 2021-2027 budget and on this point there is still total darkness. But one thing must be clear to everyone, as we have already done in recent months, and we are ready to fight to reject any proposal for cuts in the CAP. Italian farmers must not be deprived of a euro.

No split votes, everything is only voted on, so to speak, if the grand coalition wants it, and we simply do not have the floor with amendments. This is a scandal. In the shadow of the Corona crisis, we now want to wave through something that really does not deserve the name 'reform'. What annoys me is that everyone here is talking about 30% eco-schemes. Talk about the fact that it is now to be stipulated that 60% of payments are still direct payments, per area! The big farmers benefit from this, but the small farmers we need do not benefit from it. This is where Mr Babi' and Mr Orban can rejoice, and 80% of the money still goes to 20% of the companies. That will remain the case, so this is not a reform!  To me, I have to say honestly that the Socialists are the fallers of the year. We have always worked well together in the central meetings, but now they are joining the EPP. I am only surprised by this, they have to explain it. Yesterday we received a report from the Environment Agency which presents very dramatic figures. 81% of natural areas are at risk, 63% of animal species are at risk, and we are pretending that we can continue with this agricultural policy. What about the farm-to-fork strategy that is not in the template? What about the biodiversity strategy that is not in it?  They do without specific goals, as in the farm-to-fork strategy. 50% fewer pesticides, 50% fewer antibiotics, less fertilisers, but also less cheap soya imports, water consumption, more protein production in Europe. We need 10% of the area that guarantees biodiversity. None of this is in the proposals at all. Instead, at the eco-schemes, you're talking about precision farming, a farmer who squirts more accurately doesn't automatically squirt less! So, the whole thing is a laughing stock, if you look at what is being proposed now. What surprises me, Commissioner, is that you remain so calm throughout the story. With this 'reform', the Commission will not be able to make the Green Deal or achieve its climate targets. That will not happen.

Mr President, the challenges we face in the common agricultural policy are large and diverse: ensuring adequate healthy and safe food, for healthy economic businesses and with sufficient attention to nature and the environment on and around businesses. The package of strategic plans before us today does disappoint in this respect. Not only because it is only submitted by three groups, but also because of the thinking in these plans. It is still too much assumed that everything must be arranged centrally from Brussels, with all the consequences for the regulatory burden. You can see it very clearly in the basic premium, which demands even more, whereas the challenges of the future require entrepreneurship and therefore freedom for the entrepreneur to make his own choices. Fortunately, the eco-scheme has succeeded in providing a piece of customization. We also find it very difficult to provide sufficient financial compensation. As has been said, higher requirements are being placed on the basic premium, but at the same time it is going down by 30% or more. That's not fair, of course. The farmer is also required to take 10 % of his land out of production, whereas because of the system chosen, he can only be compensated financially for half of it. That too is, of course, very debatable. We need a policy that leaves room for innovative power and contributes to a fair price.

It is a massively important reform of the common agricultural policy (CAP). It will decide how our food is produced, how our land is managed, how our environment is protected or indeed destroyed. My message to the EPP, the S&amp;D and the Renew Group is that if you are so sure that what you propose is good then leave it open to democratic scrutiny. However, the use of Rule 183 makes that impossible and you know that. The chairman of the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) Committee tells us that we torpedoed the process. This is totally untrue. I have tried to make this work, but the reality is that the EPP clearly don’t want it to work. They deliberately destroyed the process in the same way as a spoilt rich kid calls halt to a game of football because they own the ball and they can. I did not sign the rejection amendment because I had some little bit of faith in those that I have worked with for the last few years. Not anymore. I had some hope that her amendments would make the CAP reform in some way meaningful. Amendments that would have really ringfenced money for the environment. Amendments that would have excluded areas that have nothing to do with the environment. Amendments that would have led to more money for the family farm. Amendments that would have recognised the reality that without a just transition, there will be no transition at all. However, now I am forced to vote for Amendment 1147 to send back the CAP to the Commission in order for them to come up with a green deal that is compatible with what they should be doing. We have time to do this correctly. We have the two-year transition period where we can come up with a common agricultural policy that works for farmers, for consumers and for the planet.

The farmer and the worker must have the same interest in a regular agreement, with advantages for those who behave well by including social conditionality.

We need a balance between a policy that – yes – looks at sustainability, which looks at climate change, but which also looks at the needs for citizens' daily food. And, Commissioner, this food security is also important, and that is something you should have in mind as the responsible Commissioner for Agriculture.  I believe that it is precisely the sad moments of the COVID-19 crisis that have shown us how important it is to take care of ourselves. And I don't want us to be on the same terms as with the protective masks and ventilators, where we had to import every junk out of the world and they were then bought away from us in front of our noses.  But we also need agriculture that looks at the diverse consumer needs and has the needs in mind – good if there is more demand for organic goods, for local production, for short supply chains. But we must also feed those who cannot afford the delicatessen every day in a safe and dignified way – there are also those in Europe. In any case, I do not want European agriculture producing for the top ten thousand, and those who have to look at the purse when they go to the supermarket will then get cheap junk from abroad.  We should not forget one thing: at the end of the day, we are talking about the ten million or so farmers in Europe. Only if our policy also helps them to get an income will they continue to exist and then there will continue to be young people in agriculture. Being a farmer is not a hobby, as is sometimes portrayed here, it is a profession. And only if we create the conditions with which they can live for all farmers, even in the more difficult situations – in the mountains – will they continue to find young successors.

First of all, I would like to protest strongly that the votes of the CAP have been brought forward from Wednesday to Tuesday. This is an unagreed step, and another agenda was adopted on Monday.  This administrative action has caused very, very great unrest in Parliament. It has rightly been attacked, many citizens are upset, and NGOs and members of the press believe that cheating is taking place here. You read, it's tactics, you read, it's a self-aggrandism, and I would like to say once again, as shadow rapporteur for the S&amp;D: this decision must be reversed immediately, the old agenda must be adhered to.  But let me now move on to the substance: a long, very complicated way of voting towards the CAP is behind us. First of all, I would like to address my speech to Mrs Ursula von der Leyen. Ursula von der Leyen did not perform her duty of care. It has tacitly accepted that, although it has proclaimed the Green Deal, an old proposal in the Agriculture Commission remained on the table. It has tacitly accepted that there is no proper link to the Green Deal, farm-to-fork or biodiversity strategy. It has remained silent, although we have said time and again in many places that we need a new reform package. It has been negligent of her to do nothing, just to remain silent and not to act. Now we have the situation we are facing: is this old draft reform even green-deal-capable, can we even change it so that it fits into the world now? I think that is really a very, very difficult question. We have tried - it is our job as A Parliament to try to get the best out of it.\" We have tried to improve this really bad draft by Mr Hogan. We have many amendments from ENVI, and although I work in the Committee on Agriculture and Consumer Development, I hope that all the amendments from ENVI will then really be adopted and accepted in Parliament. We absolutely need 30% eco-schemes – that is the least for me. It is essential that we have clear objectives for the CAP. It is essential that we have a clear link with the farm-to-fork, biodiversity strategy and the Paris Agreement. We absolutely need good green architecture, we need good red architecture, social architecture in agriculture. We must make it clear that capping is a matter of justice. Capting means justice, and we need a clear anchoring of our agricultural policy in the region. The old proposal as it stands here still has a mathematical climate protection in it. We have managed to wipe this area absolutely off the table, we cannot say that there is a computational climate protection, we automatically count the area figures at 40%. And here I am grateful to my group, the S&amp;D Group, which has said from the outset that there will be no computational climate protection with us, but only a real, a truly science-based climate protection. I would also like to say a few words to Mrs Klöckner: Mrs Klöckner, you in the Council, if you dare to water down this result here from Parliament, then you will sin against the next generation. If you dare to talk about voluntary eco-schemes, if you dare to talk about climate money ending up with bis payments, then you are sining. Under no circumstances must they greenwash the results of Parliament's vote, whatever the outcome. This is not allowed.  I would like to thank my colleagues in Parliament for working so well together, and I would like to thank the NGO groups that are on the streets.

These plans will have the immense merit of allowing each state to adapt the CAP to its needs in accordance with the broad common guidelines. They are thus achieving a kind of partial renationalisation of the CAP, which can make the system more rigid and an alternative to an outright return to national agricultural policies. Unfortunately, three problems make me doubt the effectiveness of this new agricultural model. Firstly, the CAP budget will fall considerably and it is not the smokescreen of the EUR 8 billion promised by the stimulus package that will make me forget this reality. The amount of the right to basic payment, calculated per hectare and to which farmers are very attached, will decrease and plunge many farmers into intractable difficulties. Second, the amendments tabled in plenary risk increasing their environmental burden to an unreasonable extent. A proliferation of environmental indicators would lead to the generalization of a private certification system whose cost would weigh heavily on farmers. To avoid this drift, I would like to see a cap on the overall environmental budget at 30% and a focus on incentives rather than constraints. Finally, this forced greening of European agriculture would only make sense if globalised free trade, which promotes unfair competition from non-European agricultural powers, were simultaneously renounced. Unfortunately, we are not going down the road, since on 28 April the Union concluded an agreement with Mexico whereby it agreed to import 20,000 tonnes of Mexican beef per year. In reality, the Commission does not respect our farmers; it has just admitted its cynicism by having Parliament vote on 10 July to allocate EUR 653 million from farmers' funds to migrants from Turkey.

We know that, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this is the time for high ambitions. The challenges of our time, climate change, the strengthening of global competition do not contemplate the possibility of flying low. So the new CAP must contain clear objectives linked to the objectives we have set ourselves here in Parliament on the environment and the fight against climate change, as has also been mentioned here this morning.

We therefore believe, Mr President, that we have struck the right balance between the certainty of not creating inequalities and competition between European farmers, while maintaining the common character of this policy and the control of how the money from this policy is spent which, we must never forget, allows all European citizens to continue to have quality food on their tables.  The last issue I would like to mention briefly is social conditionality.

The volume of these payments depends on the production volume in a given country more than 20 years ago. This breaks the equality of the conditions of competition, it's time to end this historic method.  Dear! Following the implementation of the changes, European agriculture is expected to implement environmental and climate action to a greater extent than before, and that is very good, but in order to achieve this objective, it is necessary to eliminate the pathological situations in many countries that it is not farmers and farmers who are the beneficiaries of direct payments.  In Poland – as confirmed by the Polish Academy of Sciences – as many as 70% of the beneficiaries of payments do not carry out agricultural activities. They are most often the owners of several hectares, that is, they are treated as small farms as priorities, and they are also exempt from environmental measures.

There are more than two thousand amendments on the table. An eloquent testimony of the inability of the committees to draw up viable compromises. And so today my speech is not directed at Members in this sham debate, but at the citizens and farmers, if they are to listen to it by mistake, because, as always, there is hardly anyone here to debate.  If you want to know how successful the EU's agricultural mismanagement has been so far, you only have to look at the death of the farm. In the last twenty years, the number of holdings in Germany has halved. Many of them operate in ancillary business because it does not last for life, because it is not possible to cope with the investments of the ever-increasing number of requirements. Family farms, which are purifies to protect, will soon be a thing of the past.  The new CAP – you only have to look at the Commission's brief summary to understand where the journey is headed. Nineteen pages explain how the farmer should improve environmental and climate performance. The main priority is more ambitious targets for climate protection, the Commission says, and contrary to what has been said to the contrary, it wants to govern more and more in national agricultural policy and calls on the Member States to submit strategic plans that need to be approved. The farmer of the future: he is allowed to plant hedges, plant trees, see flowers and create nesting places. There is only one thing it is no longer intended to do: to produce food, because the Commission believes that this is responsible for species extinction and pollution. In the meantime, food is imported and consumer protection is undermined. For example, China: 27 000 pesticides are authorised there, which find their way to us via processed foods. By comparison, only a thousand are allowed in Germany.  And the German farmer, beaten with idle associations and a similar government, whose sole priority is the Presidency of the Council, pays the price for distortions of EU competition – the most recent victim is the German sugar beet farmers – and thus finances his own abolition with German tax money.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ID", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Far-right nationalists"}, {"id": 31, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Bas EICKHOUT", "mepid": "96725", "text": "   – Mr President, thank you very much, good morning and greetings from the Netherlands. We’re going to have a very important discussion today and in the coming weeks and months on the future of European agriculture. I think what is very important is that yesterday again it was once more confirmed by the European Environmental Agency how within Europe we are still losing biodiversity, and there is a direct link with our common agricultural policies and that loss of biodiversity.  So this is the chance to fix it, to really link the CAP reform to the Green Deal, and how that possibility has been missed by the deal of the Christian Democrats, Social Democrats and Liberals. Just to go through a couple of these measures. First of all, there is this voluntary way of dealing with eco-schemes. So it’s voluntary, but if you don’t look at how you can comply with it, we come to very vague terminology like ‘you need to have actions to improve the sustainable use of pesticides’. What does that mean? Almost any measure will comply with these eco-schemes; it’s not meaningful at all.  On the other hand, the price we pay for that is that we are weakening even the general conditions, weakening the proposal of the previous Commission that did not even link it to the Green Deal, so that’s another very clear example that we are just copy-pasting non-functioning conditions from the previous time to this time. And then on top of that, we are even stating that the direct payment should be at least 60%, with that capping the possibility of companies to go even further on greening, and on top of that no link at all with the Farm to Fork Strategy being made.  You know how weak this deal is, you know it very well. That’s why you do all the tricks now to influence the voting list and to make it as early as possible – because you know that the deal is weak and the more it will be scrutinised, the more people will doubt it.

In order to tackle this emergency effectively, we need a common and coordinated approach, so that our farmers can make a further qualitative leap forward in the provision of environmental services for the benefit of the whole community. On the contrary, the proposal for cap reform presented in 2018 delegates enormous responsibilities to the Member States, in fact a renationalisation of European intervention for the agricultural sector and rural areas. That is why, as the Socialist Group, we have demanded that the debate on all three dossiers be reopened, despite the vote of the Committee on Agriculture. This is a choice that we are calling for today as a success, given the crucial steps forward that we have achieved.  Let me therefore thank our entire negotiating team for the incredible work that has been done since the COM dossier, with the strengthening of market crisis management measures and greater transparency along the supply chain to this on the horizontal regulation, through which we want to safeguard the common dimension of the CAP up to the strategic plans. And precisely with regard to the strategic plans, I am surprised by the campaigns launched in recent days by some stakeholders against the results achieved thanks to the incessant work of our negotiating team, steps forward unimaginable until a few months ago, I want to mention just a few. We call for at least 30 % of the funds from the first pillar to be devoted to eco-schemes, the measure defined at European level that should accompany and guide our farmers towards increasingly sustainable production methods. We also want to increase expenditure on agri-environmental measures in the second pillar to 35 %, adding a minimum threshold of 30 % for sustainable investments, in line with the objectives of the Green Deal and precisely in order to bring the CAP into line with these objectives, we also call for a review by 2025 of the strategic plans, taking into account the regulations deriving from the implementation of the Green Deal , all without taking second place to the economic dimension of the CAP, which according to the Treaty must improve productivity and support farmers' incomes.  In fact, we want an even stronger and more competitive agriculture and we cannot forget what our farmers and agricultural workers did during the Covid emergency, endangering their health in order to guarantee the availability of food arrived every day on our tables.  That is why we have worked on an ambitious compromise that can safeguard the social, economic and environmental sustainability of the sector. We are, more than ever, ready to meet the challenges posed by the Farm2Fork and Biodiversity strategies, which must not replace the CAP, but must complement the CAP in guiding Europe's 11 million farmers towards achieving common objectives.

Any postponement of these changes now would mean delaying by 3-4 years an opportunity to give farmers the means to take an extra step in adapting to new realities. The approach we propose means a decisive evolution of agricultural practices towards more respect for natural resources. Farmers must be able to produce quality food at decent prices, aware that it is in their interest, but also in society, to maintain biodiversity, water quality, soil fertility and reduce carbon emissions. Agricultural practices called ecoschemes, investments in farms that produce without polluting or destroying, advice to connect agriculture to digital, innovation will become the basis of a model of agriculture, with nature and technology as allies to produce healthy food.

We need to have some concrete proposals on the table, fortunately the proposal for storing CO2 in the soil got a large majority. In the forthcoming agricultural reform, it is very important that we ensure flexibility and not one solution. There is a big difference between Cyprus in the east, Sicily in the south and Finland in the north.

We are working for a simpler rule in the common agricultural policy, our farmers need a simpler and more sensible framework. I hope you will all vote for a more sustainable future.

Experts say that changing the subsidy settings would be very helpful, and I see very clearly one instrument that would help us, it is the mandatory capping of subsidies. Mandatory capping of subsidies will help small businesses, family farms, those who, on the contrary, increase and promote diversity. I have therefore proposed a voting procedure that introduces mandatory capping and which would be very helpful to us.

But we need to make a change in green architecture.  It is true that greening has not worked, and that is why society has the feeling that we have to make important changes.

That farmers are increasingly being required to focus on broader climate goals. However, this means more rules and more restrictions to be eligible. However, tightening restrictions and rules can lead to a significant loss of competitiveness for many producers and that production is no longer possible. When imposing restrictions, we must proceed from the fact that we do not cut off the perspective of the future from farmers, because the preservation of agriculture and rural life is essential to europe's future. When imposing restrictions, more account needs to be taken of the specificities of the Member States.

However, we must not forget that sustainable agriculture can only succeed if the money also arrives at our farms, with farmers, and if our family farms have a fair income.  We must ensure and ensure that high-quality and regional food supplies are guaranteed. The new CAP must therefore be balanced and set environmental, economic and socio-economic priorities in equal measure. It is also about our quality of life.  In Austria, more than 80% of farms already participate in the voluntary agri-environmental programme ÖPUL – in the second pillar, in so-called rural development. For me, local agriculture is a model here. These services, which some countries are already providing today, must also be able to be taken into account in the first pillar in the new ÖPUL scheme. As a former mayor, however, i am also concerned about strengthening rural areas, the regions. For me, this is the socio-economic component. It's about investment – from education, LEADER programs to care for the elderly, let's not forget that. And I do not want anyone to mispronounce the CAP that we already have.

Oh, well. The case of naming vegetable copies for meat products is therefore intriguing. It can easily be used to make fun of the EU – again.

I refuse to give in to climate fundamentalism and, in fact, make life easier for lazy food business marketing companies, which want to secure new market share because we consumers are starting to question the carbon footprint of traditional products in the single market. I refuse to help make free citizens in a democracy dumber than they should be in the face of what is really in their shopping basket.

Mr President, I would like to thank the Thank you for the stimulating debate. I have written down four or five arguments from the sceptics. First, we need more time. I think we have discussed every problem in the last three, two or a year, depending on the situation, and I could say: the words have changed enough, we want to see decisions at last.  Secondly, eco-schemes. I believe that there is a mistake here. Eco-schemes are not voluntary for the Member States, they are mandatory. They are voluntary for farmers, and I do not understand why we have many sceptics about farmers. Farmers are the solution to the problem and, of course, if they have been implemented sensibly by the Member States, they will not give up 30% of their income. The use of environmental programmes so far gives us the courage, and I even expect the eco-schemes to be oversubscribed. Farmers will participate more than there is perhaps money available. Third ly, compromise. It is only a compromise between the three large groups. This is visually correct, but not quite true in reality, because the three have also tried to look left and right. And anyone who reads the compromises carefully will also find suggestions from the other groups in these compromises. The compromises are specially knitted in such a way that they could achieve a broad majority. Fourthly, it is an old system. First of all, we have made a significant improvement in the Commission's proposal and, secondly, the Deliver model, that is, the changeover from action-based to results-based. I could say that if you think through this and understand it properly, it is the biggest revolution since the McSherry reform, since 1992. So together we are taking the opportunity to finally make the common agricultural policy based on results. Keyword: Small businesses are not supported enough.

Mr President, I would like to thank the The common agricultural policy has been an important brace of our Union for decades. A brace that has brought our regions together in all its diversity. These diverse regions offer the citizens of our Europe home and quality of life.  'Unity in diversity', the EU's motto, is particularly true of agriculture and rural areas. Rural life and work have nurtured and shaped traditions and customs, and has given identity not only to rural areas, but to our entire diverse European society. Our group stands by the new delivery model and the compromises that have been reached, Commissioner. The new supply model is a real opportunity to strengthen the diversity of farms in the Member States. I firmly believe that this will protect the environment, improve the climate and preserve biodiversity. And the most important thing from my personal point of view is that it can continue to produce the highest quality foods. It also offers real opportunities for farmers and foresters, because they get planning certainty and appreciation back and can also generate an income. Three key words: Performance must be rewarded – that was our basic requirement. Flexibility for diversity in the regions – we have created through these strategic plans. Simplification in the Member States for the administrative process – this is also guaranteed. Perhaps it is not the best result we have on the table now, Peter, we agree on that, but I firmly believe that we are on the right track and that we can shape the future here. Moving from compliance to performance, and taking farmers with you.  Mr President, I have one more question on the vote on our horizontal list. Why, in accordance with Rule 183(3) of the Rules of Procedure, is not the first vote on the compromises supported by all the political groups and then on those of THE EPP, S&amp;D and ECR?

It is only from such a debate that good compromises and effective solutions are born. Thank you very much for that. Of course, for a short time, I will not be able to refer to all eighty-several speeches that have been made in this debate, but I will address a few in person: speeches on behalf of political groups and some other speeches, especially coordinators from the Committee on Agriculture. Mrs Sander. Maintaining the common character of the common agricultural policy. Others have also said the same thing, and Mr De Castro has repeatedly raised this in our debates. I think we have taken a big step to increase this community character, to strengthen it. Indeed, these commission's initial proposals for 2018 may have been of some concern. I thank the European Parliament, I thank you, members of the Committee on Agriculture in particular, for the discussions that have also been inspiring for the Commission. Eco-programs – 30% mandatory. We intend to put forward some proposals for specific eco-programmes inspired by Parliament. This is a step towards removing these doubts about the Community nature of agricultural policy. On the one hand, we need to take into account the great differences that are between Member States, between countries, regions and sectors, so the strategic plans offer great flexibility. But I think what we have worked out here together will serve to maintain the common character of agricultural policy. Mrs García Pérez. Food security. This, moreover, has been the case in many other speeches. I believe that this reform will strengthen Europe's food security. The fact that we will better protect our land is that, through ecological solutions, we will counteract the devastation of our land, the devastation of the environment, it will increase the food security of our citizens in the long term. Mr Huitema spoke of direct subsidies and, on the other hand, that it would be better for farmers to be able to sustain their income on the market. Well, this is a question at all about the foundations of the common agricultural policy system. However, this was a vision of the creators of the common agricultural policy, who 60 years ago recognised that agriculture is not like any other, only agriculture is an activity that requires support, and that European farmers are unable to compete without this support, especially globally. The difficulties of all kinds that exist in Europe require farmers to have support, and I think that is what we need to continue, there is no other solution here. You also talked about local conditions. I think that strategic plans are a very good place to take these local circumstances into account. This reform gives a lot of room for action in this area. Ms Bizzotto said such important words: \"A country without agriculture is a country with no future.\" I fully agree with this, and I think that what we are doing serves the future of agriculture, that the entire European Union and all the Member States do not become countries without agriculture. In particular, what we are doing for small and medium-sized farms, because this reform – I am firmly convinced and will do my best at this second stage, at the strategic plan stage, to make these farms more strongly integrated into the whole system of the common agricultural policy, so that they are at the heart of this system. This should ensure precisely that the countries of the European Union will not become countries without agriculture and without a future. Mr Häusling pointed out a problem that obviously worries us: 80% and 20%. 80% of farmers, the smaller ones, take only 20% of EU funds and up to 20% more go to 80% of all funds. However, I believe that, thanks to eco-programmes, these proportions will change, perhaps not to the satisfaction of it, but eco-programmes – mr Kuźmiuk, among others – this is a good solution for small farms. Here I want to express my deep conviction and also to declare some of the Commission's action in favour of small and medium-sized farms, but especially for those small ones that are very often out of this competition today, disappearing, losing them at a very rapid rate – four million farms in a decade. This process will be stopped by this reform and precisely by the inclusion of small farms in the system, above all in eco-programmes. Ladies and see, 30% of this will be more than EUR 80 billion for greening. And the smaller farms will find it easier to get involved in this system. I am convinced that there will be no problems with this in order to encourage these small farmers to enter into this system of eco-programmes. They will be at the heart of this system. I'm really calm about it. There are fears that there will be unused funds. Of course, we must anticipate this and be prepared to do so, so that there is no loss of these but these small farmers will certainly be interested in going into these activities. Mr Ruissen spoke of too much central management and too little budget. I think there will be less central governance. Strategic plans, a control system that transmits more of this direct control to the Member States – that is, less central management. Budget too small? That's true. We would always like to see more, but I would remind you that it is this Commission, the Commission of President von der Leyen, that has probably put forward new proposals for the first time ever, proposals increased by EUR 26 billion. The Council has slightly reduced this increase, but it is still over €21 billion more, so this is an ambitious budget.  There was also Ms Noichl's statement that, as if the Green Deal had been imposed on the old proposal for a common agricultural policy. Well, I wouldn't agree with that. Of course, in a formal sense, this is an old proposal, but a number of new solutions have been strengthened here in terms of the Green Deal. I would also point out that this will be the second stage – strategic plans and dialogue between the Member States and the Commission. There will be room for full implementation of the field-to-table strategy, biodiversity strategy or even the methane reduction strategy adopted a few days ago in agriculture. And Mr. Flanagan. To remove from agricultural policy what is unrelated to agriculture. So. I want to say that these are the intentions. For example, the second pillar has so far financed a number of actions that can be successfully financed from other funds: cohesion policy, the recovery fund, which has been adopted and will also be able to support this agricultural environment in particular. There is a need for some reflection here. Mr. Dorfmann. Agriculture is not a hobby, it is a profession. I would add more: agriculture is a mission. And we are trying, through this reform, through the proposed solutions, to protect and support this mission. Dear! Once again, I thank you for this debate, for the solutions presented, for the compromises proposed, which are largely going in the right direction, especially in this key element, which is eco-programmes and the allocation of an adequate share of the budget for these eco-programmes. This is crucial for this reform and these are very good proposals from Parliament. I want to say this: I grew up in an agricultural family, in an agricultural environment, in which the environment was such a principle (it was and I think it is still) that it is not about profit at all costs, \"at the least cost to gain as much as possible\", but above all to leave the farm in the best possible condition. To pass on to future generations in the best possible condition: better cultivated land, better protected animals – this has always been the goal of every good farmer. I firmly believe that through this reform we will be able to leave our agriculture in a better state for future generations, and that is the aim of this reform. I would like to thank you very much for working together precisely for this purpose, for such an action for a better future.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 90, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Commissioner, thank you very much for your positive summary.

Wrong road for farmers, consumers and the environment. And this is unfortunately the choice that has been made by the Common Agricultural Policy. Since you brought agriculture to market, let us think about the abolition of milk and sugar quotas, it has become impossible for many farmers to survive. In some countries, every day, a farmer commits suicide. A new common agricultural policy should take into account not only real agricultural activity, employment and the provision of services to society, but also contribute to the transition to agro-environmental and organic practices, the reduction of meat consumption in favour of plant proteins, organic farming and short circuits.

In order to achieve this, it is necessary to treat all EU farmers equally. This is necessary in order for all farmers to have equal opportunities. Unfortunately, this unequal treatment of farmers still occurs, especially in the direct payments system. Payments to all farmers should therefore be levelled as soon as possible, regardless of their region or country.

This is the third such programme in the past nine months, as we have had to react to the outbreak of the pandemic, but I hope that it will represent a return to our normal cycle of work.  As you know, in the first 100 days of this Commission’s mandate, we set out our vision for the future and our proposed actions, notably to prepare our societies and economies for socially fair, green and digital transitions. Not long after, Europe and the world were blindsided by the COVID-19 pandemic and, together with this House and the Member States in the Council, we have taken forceful action to limit the health-related, social and economic effects of the crisis. Now, with our continent tormented by a second wave of infections, we can see more clearly than ever the magnitude of the challenge we are facing. The pandemic has sharpened the need to strengthen Europe’s long-term resilience, while we remain fully committed to our overarching ambition to lead twin green and digital transitions. It is in this context that we have drawn up the 2021 work programme. It shows how we plan to move beyond the fragility caused by the crisis, to seize the opportunity in front of us and to revitalise the European Union.  This year’s action, as well as the preparation of this work, was a joint exercise. A key institutional step in the process was the meeting between the Conference of Committee Chairs of this House and the Vice-Presidents of the Commission. This exchange offered an excellent opportunity for an in-depth discussion of our priorities and expectations. Before that, the discussions of the Conference of Presidents with President von der Leyen contributed to defining the priority initiatives for 2021, which have already been announced in the letter of intent. Let me assure you that our priority is to maintain the special partnership throughout the entire policy cycle.  The 2021 work programme marks a clear shift from strategy to delivery, with an emphasis on new legislative initiatives in Annex 1 and revisions to existing legislation in Annex 2, which stem from commitments made in the strategies adopted in the first year of the mandate. The Commission aims to deliver not only on the recovery, but also on strengthening our long-term resilience. For this reason, the narrative refers to the first strategic foresight report, which focused on resilience, and underlines that the initiatives we will put on the table will be guided by strategic foresight. This means that we consider not only what is needed to recover today, but also what is required to build a better tomorrow. Let me give you a few examples of the key initiatives planned for 2021.  Thanks to Next Generation EU, the historic recovery plan we presented, together with the revamped long-term budget, Europe has a ready-made tool to seize this opportunity. To repay the funds raised under the Next Generation EU, the Commission will put forward proposals for new own resources, starting with a revised emissions trading system, a carbon border adjustment mechanism and the digital levy. To achieve a climate neutral Europe by 2050, we have set out many of the measures that we will table as a part of the ‘fit for 55’ package. You will see the different proposals, ranging from renewables to energy efficiency. We will follow this up with a host of initiatives to implement the EU circular economy action plan, the EU biodiversity strategy and the farm to fork strategy.  To make this Europe’s digital decade, we will come forward with a roadmap of clearly defined 2030 digital goals, related to connectivity, skills and digital public services. We will also ensure the follow-up to the white paper on artificial intelligence, and we will draw lessons from the pandemic with a new industrial strategy for Europe and a legislative proposal to improve the working conditions of platform workers.  In order to mitigate the social crisis, we will put forward an ambitious action plan to fully implement the European Pillar of Social Rights, making sure that no one is left behind in Europe’s recovery. Another important initiative will be the new European child guarantee scheme, notably ensuring access to basic services like health and education for all children. To support our economies and strengthen the economic and monetary union, we will revise the framework for handling EU bank failures, take measures to boost cross-border investment in the EU and step up the fight against money laundering. Throughout next year, our geopolitical Commission will ensure that Europe continues to play a vital role in our fragile world, including by leading the global efforts to secure a safe and accessible vaccine for all. In addition, we will propose, not only the trade policy review, but also a joint communication on strengthening the EU’s contribution to rules-based multilateralism, among other key initiatives designed to create a stronger Europe in the world. In the face of COVID-19, the Commission proposes building a stronger European health union, including through the creation of a new agency for biomedical advanced research and development. To preserve and improve its functioning, a new strategy for the future of Schengen will be tabled, together with a number of measures on legal migration. We will continue the implementation of the security union and will set out a comprehensive strategy on combating anti-Semitism.  Finally, many initiatives will fall under the push for European democracy, including new strategies on the rights of the child and for persons with disabilities, as well as a proposal to combat gender-based violence. The Commission will, among other things, propose clearer rules on the financing of European political parties and take action to protect journalists and civil society against abusive litigation. A long-term vision for rural areas will propose actions to harness the full potential of these regions. To make sure everyone can have their say, we also stress that it is now more important than ever that we launch the Conference on the Future of Europe.  It is clear that the coming year will be a busy one for policymaking in very difficult circumstances. Given that this work programme is focused on delivery, we must therefore be fully committed to our better regulation, better law-making agenda. In the coming weeks, we will put forward a new better regulation communication to offer a renewed focus on consultation, impact assessment, simplification and border reduction. In total, we are announcing 86 flagship initiatives this year, grouped under 44 policy objectives or packages. Under the regulatory fitness and performance programme (REFIT), we have proposed 43 significant pieces of legislation for evaluation or revision. To close, let me underline that bringing all our ambitions to life will require a team effort among all institutions. In this respect, let me highlight the importance of the joint declaration on legislative priorities to be endorsed by the presidents of the three institutions. It will serve as a concrete roadmap for our joint work and, in parallel, we will engage in the first ever multiannual programming to capture our common strategic priorities for Europe. Thank you very much for your attention and for your great cooperation in preparing the Commission’s work programme. I am really looking forward to your questions and comments.

Our clear strategies also need to be clearly communicated. The EPP Group welcomes the Commission’s work programme and we are ready to work together on the implementation of our priorities.  Now I would like to briefly walk you through the EPP’s priorities, aside from the multiannual financial framework (MFF) and the recovery package. First, the digital strategy. During this plenary, the European Parliament is to adopt six reports on the Digital Services Act and artificial intelligence. These files matter a lot and we are now opening up discussions on how we, as regulators, can strike the right balance between digital progress and the respect of fundamental rights and freedoms. It is up to us, as policymakers, to build a regulatory framework for where voluntary commitments from the private sector are not enough. We have to create an artificial intelligence ecosystem that serves the people first. Looking to the future, we have to make education and training systems fit for the digital age. The digital revolution also requires enhanced cross-border judiciary cooperation.  Second, the functions of the Schengen area. With the second wave of the pandemic sweeping through Europe, better coordination is necessary to avoid disruption of the internal market and preserve jobs. We welcome the intention of the Commission to present a new strategy for the future of Schengen. However, unfortunately, we see that Member States have once again adopted various national restrictions which undermine not only the right of EU citizens to free movement, but also the recovery of the EU economy. Our Group supports a healthy Union that enables innovation, invests in the health and well-being of its citizens, and increases our resilience and preparedness to tackle cross-border health threats. An aging population, the need to ensure better access to treatment for all, the high prevalence of chronic diseases or diseases with a high social burden, such as cancer, require a more coordinated response at European level.  We also believe that the EU must shape globalisation and use its trade policy to set standards internationally. Our ability to conclude win-win agreements is fundamental to economic growth and recovery. However, we must not be naive. We strongly support the Commission in ensuring that the interests of the EU are fully protected and that our companies do not suffer from unfair competition. This brings me to the industrial strategy, which has to remain competitive while taking into account the digital and environmental challenges of tomorrow.  Last but not least, the Green Deal. Our environmental ambitions cannot be only about defending targets. The EPP will focus on concrete means that will bring about a significant reduction in emissions. Innovation and research will be key in this field. We ask the Commission to keep this in mind when negotiating the MFF and specific programmes with the Council. Fighting against climate change and fighting for employment in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic are the top priorities of our citizens.

That’s why we commend the Commission Work Programme and your work, Mr Vice-President, in its preparation. But let me be clear on our priorities.  The Recovery Plan and the MFF cannot be stalled. They are crucial for the economic rebound. Also, the Health Union has to be delivered properly. And we must speed up on the digital and green transitions. But we will deceive ourselves if we think that they have no consequences for the people. They should not go forward without a red heart in them.  In that regard, we salute the Commission’s compromise to present an action plan to ensure the full implementation of the European Pillar of Social Rights, but we need more. We need to fight poverty and protect European workers. Many will be vulnerable to the digital transformation. Energy poverty must be addressed or it will be just worsened by the green transition.  The European Union has to do whatever it takes to assure that the recovery and the twin transitions are fair, effective and long lasting. That implies tax fairness across Europe, flexibility on the fiscal rules to be kept for several years, and also that previous rules must change, avoiding pressure over Member States to introduce austerity measures, as it happened 10 years ago with all the consequences we know. By opposite, measures providing a stabilisation function, such as the Unemployment Reinsurance Scheme, must be really implemented.  It is through solidarity that Europe will prevail. Solidarity amongst people, regions and Member States. Solidarity with migrants that need safe and legal paths. Solidarity and values. Fighting for real gender equality. Promoting the rule of law, our values, the SDGs in Europe and all over the world.

The truth is, we don’t know how long we have to live with this virus. We face the unknown, and as creatures of habit we don’t like uncertainty.  As once more, we ask people in Europe to work from home, to limit social contacts, to close businesses, it is our job as policymakers not just to ensure we ride out this storm together, we also need to give people perspective. We need to provide people with the certainty that we will pull Europe out of this health and economic crisis. How do we do this, Commissioner? By focusing on what we can do and on what we know, and by focusing on the silver linings. So what can we do? When a teacher is brutally murdered, we can stand up for free speech and fight against external illiberal threats! When journalists are threatened, we can defend the free press and bring the perpetrators to justice. When we see the rule of law undermined, we cannot stay quiet. Actions that undermine the rule of law need to have consequences.  Our values are the foundation on which we have built our European house and we cannot paint over the cracks. This is something we can do. This is something we should do. And what do we know? We know that we are facing bad economic weather. But we also know that we hold the keys to new economic growth – by finishing the single market, by eliminating barriers to trade for our SMEs, by investing in green innovation and technologies. But the biggest unlocked potential to new growth has come to light as a result of corona.  The silver lining of all of our many online meetings. We can all see that the future is digital. We see it in this House this week with the first online plenary session. To tap into this potential, we need to think globally. Because the internet has no borders and if we don’t make the rules, others will. We need a geopolitical digital strategy. The Commission is announcing its proposals for Europe’s digital decade in January, and Renew Europe wants to see a solid strategy to build that digital economy.

Let me just start by saying that I consider this multitude of shutdown and lockdown measures across Europe to be completely excessive. Here too, speaking more or less in front of an empty house, a ghost house, is the wrong signal if we want to give hope to the people of Europe and in our Member States.  The reproach I am making to the European Union here is that this crisis is being misused to implement more and more centralisation. This concerns the Multiannual Financial Framework, the Social Union, the Corona Bonds – a multitude of measures which, in the piggybacking process of this wave, are suddenly taking place here without the democratic involvement of the Member States. Another area is the Green Deal agreement, where excessive measures, with up to 55% of savings, are a death blow to the economy and industry. Especially at a time like now, we must give people confidence and react with a sense of proportion, which, in my view, is not the case. If you are doing nature conservation and environmental protection – which I am for – yes, please start with the large number of lorry journeys, completely superfluous across Europe.

I was part of a very vigorous discussion in the General Affairs Council as you know, this was also debated on the level of the European Council, and I know that you devote a lot of time to looking for the best ways on how to tackle the pandemic and I think that the answers you provided are the correct ones.  We need more coordination. We need to inform each other better. We need to listen more to the science and we need the stronger health union – where we will find the better ways for how to inform each other about border closures, where we would align the methodologies for testing for scientific data and where we, as we are doing right now, would be focusing for making sure that we will play this good role of Europe, for making sure that we will guarantee the high quality, tested, proven vaccines for all, not only in Europe but on the entire planet.  That’s, I think, one of the key missions: to show that Europe is doing its utmost to make sure that our world is a better place, and I’m sure that with your support we will build the stronger health union in the European Union and also we will equip Europe with the instruments we need, and thank you very much for that support.  The green and digital. There was a lot of discussion and I remember that we have been debating also together whether COVID-19 would in any way slow down our efforts in making sure that this twin transition will bring the transformative effects we expect from it to the benefit of the European economy.  I think we have seen the opposite. We have seen that the COVID—19 crisis has served as an accelerator of our efforts and that more and more people in Europe realised during this first lockdown how nature is important, how protection of the environment is crucial for the survival of the human species, and how important it is not to waiver in protecting our environment, and therefore we need to find the ways for how this twin transition could be mutually reinforced.  It will be part one of our foresight studies for the next year: what are the links and how can we reinforce these green and digital processes together? I would really like to thank you for the very good discussion and your legislative reports on artificial intelligence, on the digital services act and on digital policies. They will, for sure, help us dramatically in launching what is already happening, that this decade should be the decade of digital policies for Europe. Mr Marques and also Mr Papadimoulis but also Mr Azmani have rightly highlighted the importance of social policies. I think that if you look at our programme you will see that we are presenting a very ambitious action plan. It’s not a plan, it’s an action plan. Concretely, what we are going to do in making sure that nobody is left behind and that we are going to deliver on the very concrete elements, how to build the European pillar of social rights, and I think that we will be debating every single measure and I’m sure that together we will create a much stronger social network, much stronger social policies, which I hope would mitigate the dire consequences of not only the health but also the economic crisis through which we are going together. I would like to thank Mr Kovatchev, Mr Marques, and also Mr Lamberts, for on one side the strong calls for being more ambitious and also for reminding us that to achieve all these ambitious policies we need sources, we need instruments, and in our case this is the multiannual financial perspective, this is the Next Generation EU.  I can assure all of you that we will do our utmost to be an honest broker. You know where we stand in this very important institutional debate and discussions, I heard that the negotiators are working very hard, that they are optimistic, despite the very difficult discussions, that we will have this very important financial instrument at our disposal as of 1 January 2021.  I think the citizens would have a hard time forgiving us if we wouldn’t manage to get that, so I think we have to put all our minds, all our creativity, all our good political will, to making sure that we will have the budget and the Next Generation EU in place as of 1 January 2021 so we can implement all of the proposals which we discussed today ,because as you all underlined, this should be really the year where we will move from strategy to delivery. That’s our intention and I’m sure that thanks to your close cooperation and your support, we will achieve that.

Belarusian people are bravely facing unlawful arrests, humiliation, assaults, injuries or worse caused by the security forces that should be protecting them. Over 14 000 Belarusians were detained, more than 350 criminal cases initiated and the list of political prisoners is nearing up to 100. All of these brutalities is because of one person – Alexander Lukashenko – who puts his own interests over the future of the Belarusian people and the independence of Belarus.  The Belarusian people are fighting for their freedom and dignity, for their right to free and fair election and their right to have a say in the matters determining the future of their country. They seek to break free from Lukashenko’s 26 years-long dictatorship. Their brave and inspiring actions require three simple actions from our side: solidarity, support and sanctions. Together with colleagues, we have made sure that this recommendation report to the Council and Commission and the High Representative would guide the European Union’s policy towards Belarus accordingly.  We listened and heard Belarusian people, who are not like their former President, are forward looking. They want to live in a free, democratic and prosperous country. The main demand of the Belarusian people is to halt violence against peaceful protests, to organise new, free and fair elections and release all detained protesters and political prisoners. Our answer must be loud and clear. All violence must stop, everyone detained for political reasons must be immediately released and those responsible have to be brought to justice. The new election has to be held as soon as possible and in compliance with international standards and supervision of the OSCE. The Coordination Council initiated by Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, President-elect according to the Belarusian people, should be recognised as the legitimate representative of the Belarusian people and supported in its efforts to start a dialogue with the regime, for the sake of peaceful and democratic transition of power.  The EU-imposed sanctions against the main culprits must be extended. The sanctions list has to include Alexander Lukashenko and go beyond his closest environment. Our support, including the financial one, should go directly to the Belarusian people. The EU must also think about a comprehensive programme for Belarus to invigorate its economy after the new presidential elections are held. The EU-Eastern Partnership programme has all tools and expertise to help Belarus to modernise and diversify its economy and fight corruption, among other things. In addition to applying pressure to the Belarusian regime over human rights violations, the European Union has to be alert regarding the launch of the unsafe Astravets Nuclear Power Plant this November. Nuclear dictatorship of Lukashenko presents a major threat to the security of Europeans.  People on the streets of Belarus have spoken. Now it’s time for us to show our understanding, support and action.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 128, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Josep BORRELL FONTELLES", "mepid": "28267", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Auštrevičius for his report, and also all the other Members of this Parliament who have contributed to it. It’s clear that Parliament has demonstrated overwhelming support for the rights of the Belarusian people and have brought support to the actions taken by the European Union institutions at all levels so far.  I took note of Parliament’s September resolution on Belarus and your recommendations today are more than welcome as a further substantive contribution to our work. I agree with you; unfortunately, the situation on the ground in Belarus has not improved. There has been and continues to be a brutal crackdown against citizens, journalists, and against members of the Coordination Council itself. The Interior Minister recently authorised the use of lethal force – lethal force! – and the increasing levels of violence against protesters are extremely worrying. They are sending extremely worrying signs, but also signs of the desperation on the side of the authorities, aware as they are of the unwavering commitment of Belarusians to a democratic future for their country. This House knows very well that the European Union has firmly rejected the falsified results of the 9 August presidential elections. We did that at the Foreign Affairs Council. They did that at the European Union Council and the Commission had also joined its voice to this choir. Now we have clearly said that Alexander Lukashenko lacks any democratic legitimacy. We say about him the worst thing that one can say about someone who wants to govern a country: ‘you lack democratic legitimacy for doing so, we don’t recognise you as the legitimate President of Belarus’. I want to stress that and repeat it again, solemnly, at this sitting of European democracy.  We have now adopted sanctions against 40 Belarusian officials responsible for violence, repression and election falsification. We did that a couple of weeks ago, but since the situation in Minsk continues to deteriorate and there seem to be limited prospects for a dialogue – I’m saying ‘limited’ rather than saying ‘not at all’ – the Council gave its political green light to start the preparation of the next sanctions package. At that time, it will include also Alexander Lukashenko himself. The technical work started immediately after the Council and it will be finished soon. No Member State put any kind of obstacle forward to that. The comprehensive Council conclusions we adopted on 12 October 2020 sent a clear message that the conduct of these elections has had an adverse effect on European Union-Belarus relations and we have also stated that ‘business as usual’ is no longer possible. So our relations with Belarus are in the course of being re-examined.  At the same time, and in line with your recommendation, we have reiterated that the European Union stands in solidarity and will step up support to civil society. I also had the opportunity of conveying this message in a phone call I had with the Foreign Affairs Minister of Belarus.  We have also emphasised that the European Union stands ready to support a meaningful democratic transition in Belarus and we are working on a comprehensive economic support package that the European Union institutions would be ready to offer to a new democratic Belarus.  The European Union remains united in its assessment of the situation and the actions that have to be taken, as I made clear once again when I spoke to Foreign Minister Makei on 9 October, 10 days ago.  All Member States continue to call on the Belarusian authorities to end violence and repression, release all detainees and political prisoners, and respect media freedom. The attempts by the Belarusian authorities to target certain EU Member States by asking them to reduce their diplomatic representation in Minsk will not weaken our unity.  I share the views of Members of this House, as clearly expressed in the recommendation, that only an inclusive national dialogue with the broader society, in particular with the Coordination Council, can lead to a peaceful and sustainable solution of the crisis. We continue to support the proposal for an OSCE mission to facilitate this dialogue and we are promoting such an approach with all international actors, but I have to say that, to my regret, the Belarusian authorities have not responded at all. In French you would say ils sont aux abonnés absents, no answer.  The people’s patience is running out, as we have seen from the call by Ms Tsikhanouskaya for certain actions to be taken by 25 October. We admire the perseverance and the determination of the peaceful demonstrators facing threats, intimidation and violence, and call on them to remain peaceful and not to fall into provocations. I know this would be difficult but I think this is the best thing they can do.  In this difficult period for the Belarusian people we continue our full support for their democratic right to elect their president through new, free and fair elections under OSCE observation. I have to thank all of you again for your detailed recommendation on Belarus.

As we know, the people of Belarus have, for 10 weeks in a row, been continuing their protests. The European Parliament, along with all other EU institutions, has until now shown clear and very dynamic political leadership in support of the Belarusian people. Indeed, Parliament President David Sassoli was the first to invite Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya to visit Brussels. This was a very important visit, which was followed by other high-level meetings. Today, we need to ask ourselves: what else can we do, in practical terms, as Parliament, as Members of this House? I have three brief ideas. First, without further delay, by decision of the leadership of Parliament, let’s create a high-level Belarusian mission of former presidents and prime ministers, as was done with the Kwaśniewski-Cox mission to Ukraine. In this way, we can consolidate our position within the EU and increase pressure not only on Lukashenko, but also on Putin. Second, let’s join our efforts with Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya’s headquarters and let’s assist them in establishing information centres here in Brussels, and maybe later on in other capitals.  Third, together with proper pro-democracy foundations, let’s establish a special centre for the international investigation of OMON crimes, with a mandate to collect evidence and assist with legal expertise at the start of individual criminal cases.  Those are just a few ideas of what we can do. We, and the whole EU, can do much more!

Cooperation with the Belarusian authorities is no longer possible as long as the regime continues the brutal repression against the people and does not release all recent detainees and political prisoners. This is why the European Union must move from critical engagement to critical reassessment. To start with, European Union financial assistance must solely benefit civil society.

While we debate, Putin’s Russia has encroached Belarus’ sovereignty and the dictator in Minsk is ready to sell his country to save himself. Enough with debates, let’s take actions. First, the sanctions list has to be updated and extended by everyone who executes Lukashenko’s orders. We should also include those in the list who spread misinformation and propaganda from Russia. Second, those athletes, scientists, students, doctors, IT specialists, should immediately be given Schengen visas and get the opportunity to work here in the European Union.

The regime continues to engage in repressions and the number of political prisoners is growing, while brave Belarusians are defying the regime’s brutality and expressing their desire to live in a free, democratic and sovereign Belarus.

The only thing I can say is that you can be sure that we will continue our support to the Belarusian people, to civil society and the independent media, by all the means that we have – financially and politically, through international cooperation and coordination, as some Members have said, trying to support the media, trying to isolate the Lukashenko government, providing financial support to the people of Belarus, avoiding that these resources go through the hands of the government – because we are strongly convinced, as all of you have said, that the Belarusian people deserve better and their demand for new, free and fair elections should be answered positively.  The only way out of this situation is to hold free and fair elections. It means repeating the elections and the support of this Parliament would be vital for this effort. We have been witnessing on the streets of Belarus, in Minsk and other cities, unprecedented levels of repression for the last two months. We do not recognise the result of these elections but unhappily the Belarusian authorities have not accepted any kind of international offer of mediation. We would be very happy to send an observation mission to Belarus but for that we need to have the agreement of the government and for the time being, believe me, all of our efforts have been completely useless.  I am not negotiating or in touch with the Belarusian authorities. I have just made a couple of phone calls trying to express our concern and asking what would be the prospects for the Belarusian Government to accept an OSCE mission. The answer – keep in mind that the next president of the OSCE in office about activities of this kind will be my colleague the Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs – but unhappily, the answer was completely a negative one.  Finally, let me also stress that we are not going to do that as a geopolitical issue, as some Members were worried about. No, it’s not a matter of the Belarusian people having to choose between one side or another. It’s a matter of the Belarusian people being able to have a political regime that ensures their human rights and to behave and to live in a democratic system that respects their political will. This is what it is all about and I once again thank the rapporteur and the people who have been helping him with this work.  I know there are issues that Mr Auštrevičius mentioned on nuclear safety cooperation. I would like to answer precisely this specific question and inform you that in the Council conclusions of 12 October we already stressed the importance of this issue and we urged Belarus to comply with the standards and environmental safety of the European Union and to follow the European Union recommendations in this field without delay. In this regard, technical cooperation among the European Union Member States and Belarusian nuclear safety regulators remains of utmost importance for implementing, reviewing and monitoring an ordered implementation of our standards.

The European Union cannot be a passive observer. For many years, we have been supporting human rights defenders and democratic civil society in Belarus. Now that they have emerged from the sidelines, with tens of thousands of Belarusian people marching through the streets calling for democratic change, they should feel the solidarity and support of the EU and its citizens. As previously mentioned, the European Union’s policy towards Belarus should be led by the following three acts: solidarity, support and sanctions. The European Union should take active measures to prevent hybrid or direct Russian intervention in Belarus. I call upon the current German Presidency of the Council to lead the diplomatic efforts to prevent any interference and to support the democratic aspirations of the Belarusian people.

At the same time international journalists have been stripped of their media accreditation. In contrast to ongoing oppression of independent media, Russia’s “assistance” is welcomed. Russia is providing its so-called “media experts” to replace Belarussian journalists and is using financial funds to buy and take over the media outlets and widely used information channels on Telegram.

Despite physical and financial threats, independent Belarusian journalists continue to cover brutal oppressions of peaceful protests.

The Treaty consists of three mutually reinforcing pillars which deal respectively with the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, nuclear disarmament and the civilian use of nuclear energy. The Treaty has been joined by 191 nations, which is the overwhelming majority of the global community, including all five of the recognised nuclear weapons states. As such the Treaty represents the only binding commitment by the five permanent members of the UN Security Council to work towards global nuclear disarmament.  At the 1995 Review Conference the Treaty’s duration was extended indefinitely. A review conference of the Treaty is held every five years, but regrettably every other one of those review conferences in this century has ended without a consensus regarding the final document. Therefore I believe that it is of critical importance that the 50—year anniversary review conference, already postponed once because of the COVID pandemic, be a success.  Our 27 Member States joined the NPT as individual nations, but I believe that in order to contribute to the success of the upcoming review conference, it is necessary that a strong consensus position be forged among the EU Member States. The recommendations to the Council that we are going to vote on at this week’s plenary session are aimed at helping the Member States to agree on such a position.  I would argue that regarding its central objectives, the NPT has been relatively successful during the past half century. The nightmare scenarios painted during and after the Cold War regarding the proliferation of nuclear weapons to dozens of countries around the world have not materialised, and after the end of the Cold War the nuclear arsenals of Russia and the United States were brought down significantly from the peak numbers of warheads. Yet significant problems and challenges remain as many of the objectives of the Treaty have yet to be fulfilled and some important stones in the nuclear disarmament and non—proliferation architecture are still missing. The CTBT, or the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, negotiated in the 1990s is still awaiting ratification by a number of its Article 16 countries, and the proposed Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty is still under discussion at the UN Conference on Disarmament, with not much tangible progress to show during the past several years.  Moreover, even though a vast majority of the global community of nations have joined the NPT, there are still some outliers, including countries that are known or believed to be in possession of nuclear weapons or are believed to have pursued nuclear weapons programmes in the past. It must be noted that, with the exception of the five nuclear weapon states, all other countries are only able to accede to the NPT as non-nuclear weapon states. While the immediate accession of the remaining outliers is thus not likely, a question remains as to how to make sure that they would not contribute to global or regional proliferation of nuclear weapons materials and know-how. There are additional clouds on the horizon. Over the past several years, we have seen gradual erosion of important arms control regimes that have for decades been a critical element of European security. Following the consistent violations by Russia, the US has left the INF, the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, last year. The future of the JCPOA, the so-called Iran nuclear deal, remains uncertain. The US announcement that it would leave the Open Skies Treaty throws in doubt the future of an important transparency and confidence building instrument. As the New START Treaty is expected to expire next year it is inevitable that the growing level of tensions and mistrust do not contribute positively to the atmosphere of negotiating its successor. Yet when it comes to the future of nuclear disarmament, it is the two countries in possession of the bulk of global nuclear arsenals that bear the greatest responsibility.  Perhaps even more worrisome is the increasing reliance by some nuclear weapon states on those weapons in their military doctrines. With nuclear disarmament efforts having stalled significantly, a new delivery system is being designed and built, the danger of intentional or unintentional escalation involving the use or effective use of nuclear weapons is growing. All that is why the success of the NPT Review Conference is of utmost importance for global as well as European security.  But let me end with a word of caution. It is clear that our eventual goal must be a nuclear-free world and the elimination of nuclear weapons, but it is a goal that we must approach pragmatically, evaluating very carefully both the immediate and long-term security consequences and implications of each step along the way. A nuclear-free world cannot be negotiated and agreed upon without the participation of the five nuclear weapon states. No false parity must be created between the five nuclear weapon states and those actors that are pursuing nuclear weapons illegally.  While on the one hand every nuclear warhead less is a step towards a more secure world, it is also true that the world where the only remaining nuclear weapons are the illegal ones is not a safer place for us to live in. Therefore I strongly believe that while looking for all possible alternative avenues to reach our eventual goal, we should not choose the ones that risks bringing the time-tested NPT and its review process to a standstill.

This upcoming review conference is the next most important event on global non-proliferation and disarmament – at least what remains of it. Despite current uncertainty about when the conference will take place, it remains the most important event in the world on non-proliferation and disarmament. We are all concerned about the deteriorating security environment and the continued pressure on the nuclear non-proliferation architecture, as illustrated by the demise of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. We very much regretted it when it happened and we continue to regret it now.  It is essential that all state parties comply with their Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations and fully implement all commitments under the Treaty. Upholding and preserving the Non-Proliferation Treaty must remain a key priority for European Union foreign policy. The European Union strongly supports all three pillars of the Treaty – non-proliferation, nuclear disarmament and peaceful use of nuclear energy – and we will continue to promote a comprehensive, balanced and full implementation of the 2010 Review Conference Action Plan.  Through intensive diplomatic engagement, backed up by the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), under the Council decision we are promoting the ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the preparation of negotiations for a Fissile Material Cut-off Treaty. We are also proud to support the regional conference in preparation for the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference. We are also going to double our efforts to uphold international norms, to restore dialogue and trust, and to promote transparency and confidence-building measures. Together with Member States, we are preparing a strong and forward-looking common European Union position for the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, and I would like to stress some of the key elements of our position in the context of your report. First, we will continue to call strongly on the United States and Russia to extend the New START Treaty before February 2021, and we will encourage negotiations for a broader future agreement. Second, we welcome the various initiatives for nuclear disarmament, including the Stockholm Initiative. Third, we acknowledge the increased attention given to risk reduction and we hope discussions on this topic gain broad support.  The promotion of universal adherence and the entry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, as I have already mentioned, remain top priorities for the European Union and this conference will also provide an opportunity to address the non-proliferation crisis. We continue to call on the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to refrain from further provocations and to take concrete steps towards abandoning all its nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programmes.  We will also reaffirm our commitment and support for the Iran nuclear deal, the so-called Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). We deeply regret the United States’ 2018 withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal and the subsequent reimposition of UN sanctions on Iran. At the same time, we are gravely concerned by Iran’s activities that are inconsistent with the JCPOA and have severe proliferation implications. Finally, let me underline that we also take due note of your proposal to encourage talks on the possibility of a multilateral ballistic missile treaty. Thank you for all your comments, observations and proposals. Mr Mikser, Honourable Members, I look forward to listening to your views and I thank you for your attention.

We must remember the devastating destructive power of nuclear weapons. We must also ensure that it is not forgotten how unlike all other weapons are nuclear weapons. And we know that in the past there has often been talk of deterrence and of the fact that mutual deterrence would provide a certain degree of security. That is certainly true to some extent, but even better than deterrence, namely much better, is disarmament in the case of nuclear weapons.  I am therefore glad that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty exists. I am not glad that only three EU Member States, namely Ireland, Malta and my own country, Austria, have already ratified the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. I would also like to remind all of us that there is also a great danger that non-state actors can acquire nuclear weapons, and the devastating effects of acts of terrorism with nuclear weapons are almost unimaginable.  I think it is right that the United States and Russia are negotiating a successor agreement to the START agreement already mentioned by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs. I think it is good that this is taking place in the capital of my home country, Austria, in Vienna. I think it is bad that China is completely evasing itself. I think it is bad that China simply does not participate in such negotiations, but we should not shy away from reducing nuclear weapons, disarming them and – yes – also believing in a nuclear-weapon-free world one day.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "na"}, {"id": 148, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Andreas SCHIEDER", "mepid": "197670", "text": "  Mr President, I would like to make a mifful son, mr President, I would like to make a ido to the S&amp;D Group.

The Non-Proliferation Treaty is central, especially since the end of the INF Treaty. The US and Russia must quickly restore the dialogue on disarmament and arms control, including China.  And the goal of a nuclear-weapon-free world also includes creating a nuclear-weapon-free Europe. A Europe in which no nuclear weapons are possessed, but in which no nuclear weapons are stationed by other powers. And that includes a nuclear-weapon-free Middle East – that, too, is a very central concern for me. In addition, more effort and implementation is needed in ratifying the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, which was also initiated by my own country, Austria.

This Treaty is a great success. Of the 191 states that have signed up, only nine have nuclear weapons. This is a much smaller number than anyone could have predicted when the Treaty entered into force 50 years ago.  Our biggest challenge now is to make North Korea and Iran adhere to the Treaty. If not, why would any of the other signatory states do so. Saudi Arabia has already declared it will develop nuclear arms if Iran has access to a nuclear bomb, and Turkey might very well follow suit. In this environment, we should not blame Israel for having nuclear weapons. They are essential for its survival. The EU must continue its efforts to stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons, preferably via the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, but if Iran is not willing to honour its engagements, we will have to find other means. North Korea will not be persuaded by the West alone. For that, we need the Chinese on board. I am afraid that as long as China does not see a North Korean nuclear weapon as a problem, it will be difficult to make any substantial progress.  To conclude, the European Union must continue to promote the NPT and that its Members honour their commitments.

Except to share this deterrence with our neighbours, European sovereignty does not exist. Germany would of course like this, reinforced by the contradictions of Emmanuel Macron, but it is out of the question, for the defenders of a Europe of the nations that we are, whether this tool is shared or diluted. Only the nation-state with the inalienable right to defend itself is the legitimate framework for the use of this supreme force. The NPT, while a necessary guarantee of stability and balance, cannot prevent our sovereign nation, France, from possessing this tool. I also warn this House against the Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty that is now behind the NPT. This treaty will not serve the cause of disarmament. No state with nuclear weapons will sign it and does not displease the most naïve, the atom will never be deinvented.

The recommendations we are giving today to the Council and the High Representative of the Union are therefore of major importance. We can stand back, and wait for the harmful policies of the governments that hold these arsenals to produce disastrous effects, or we can be part of the historic approach and momentum of a disarmament initiative for our collective security. The 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty already had an obligation to negotiate disarmament. To fully support its implementation, this Parliament must give its clear support to the Nuclear Weapons Ban Treaty. When it was adopted in 2017, some said that the treaty, which angers those who believe in nuclear power and deterrence, would struggle to enter into force. Today, it is imminent to come into force. Within our Union, Austria, Ireland and Malta have already ratified it and new cities are supporting it. I hear some of the talk of realistic disarmament.

Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the commissioners for their excellent work and for the work they have When we exchanged views in this House in June of this year about the tragic events in Minneapolis, we were all united in grief and anger at the brutal murder of George Floyd. For many of us, this has only been the tip of the iceberg, because we experience such things in far too many places. Now anger and sorrow are required, but it is even more important that appropriate consequences be drawn from it. The Council expressly agrees with what you, honourable Members, have said in your resolution. Now it is always difficult to draw parallels between what is happening in the United States of America and developments in the European Union. Nevertheless, it is absolutely clear that all the Member States of the European Union must ensure that the use of force by law enforcement authorities must always be lawful, proportionate, necessary and last resort.  We have a number of instruments at EU level to put this important understanding of the work of our security authorities on a firm footing. I would like to mention just a few examples and, above all, to highlight the important work of the EU Agency for Law Enforcement Training – CEPOL. Respect for human rights in law enforcement activities is regularly placed at the heart of the relevant offers to the security authorities. Issues such as unlawful profiling, police ethics or the detection and combating of hate crimes have been a mainstream part of CEPOL's training for law enforcement professionals in recent years. I would like to highlight one more point, honourable Members. More recently, a great deal of emphasis has been placed on prevention, prevention instead of coercive measures. The European Crime Prevention Network has been formally affiliated to the Council's Law Enforcement Group and the Council adopted conclusions on certain aspects of European preventive policing in 2019.  We all know, of course, that the protection of national security remains the sole responsibility of the individual Member States. This is guaranteed in Article 4 of the Treaty on European Union and also in Article 72 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. Nevertheless, there are various EU legal instruments which, above all, help in cross-border police cooperation between our Member States, that what the security authorities do improves and is always consistently based on the principles of the rule of law.  In this respect, each Member State still decides for itself on the structure and organisation of its prosecution. Precisely because this is the case, it is so important to reach common agreement on the principles of the rule of law, which must be strictly observed by all Member States. We need sound systems for effective judicial review and effective remedies. This is particularly important in cases which you have also mentioned here as an example in your remarks. This is mainly about investigations by national authorities, it is about the work of parliamentary committees and, of course, it is also about the internal police investigation services.  Let me make it clear once again that all the Member States of the European Union are obliged, together with their national authorities, to prosecute any criminal offence found and to take all other appropriate measures. We are currently having some controversy in the European Union about this. I would like to highlight the debates we are having in my own country, Germany. There is a broad debate there about institutional racism. We have now decided on the part of my government that we also want to review the security authorities and, in particular, the police authorities, where there is a need for readjustment, where we need to improve and where there is also a lack of a common understanding of a clear commitment to democracy and against racism.  This commitment by all the Member States and this common commitment are also important, above all, to the policemen and women, who do an excellent job on a daily basis in order to protect our liberal democracy and our constitutional states from the enemies of democracy. It is precisely these police officers, the employees of the security authorities, who deserve respect and recognition.  This makes it all the more important that we emphasise once again that the commitment of the Member States to It is aimed at doing everything possible to correct such errors, to make a clear commitment to a strong rule of law committed to freedom and democracy, and to ensure that our security authorities fully respect and protect democratic values and fundamental rights, throughout the European Union and in its 27 Member States.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 158, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Heidi HAUTALA", "mepid": "2054", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Madam President, I wish to thank Members very much for this debate. I think it’s a very important topic to debate in this Parliament.  Let me start to tell you about Rissa. Rissa Seidou is a young policewoman in Sweden. She’s black. She says ‘the best part of this job is to build trust in the police. We are here for young people. If we succeed in getting someone to leave the criminal path, trust can spread’. That is so right, law enforcement is about trust. Trust in society. Trust in our ability to protect people. Trust that we protect all people regardless of nationality, their sex and their sexual orientation and the colour of their skin.  In Europe we trust the police. It’s normal to go up to a policewoman or policeman to ask for directions. It’s normal to not be afraid when you report a crime. But Black Lives Matter reminds us it’s not normal for everyone in our societies. And not just in America. Sadly, cases of illegal police violence are also reported in Europe.  I firmly condemn all forms of illegal or disproportionate use of violence and discriminatory practices by law enforcement authorities. That goes against the fundamental rights and values upon which our Union is founded. Any use of force by law enforcement authorities should be proportionate and justified, otherwise we’ll lose trust. To build trust takes a long time, but it can be lost in an instant.  So we must always work hard on trust because people should be able to trust law enforcement authorities and because European policing is based on trust. European policing is community policing. We can only police effectively if we have constant cooperation and the trust of the community. Policemen and policewomen have an important and difficult job. They keep people safe from terrorists and criminals. I admire the police officers who fight child sexual abuse, who face terrible crimes and trauma in the line of duty.  Police put their lives at risk just doing their job. Last week a police station was attacked in Paris and a gunman shot and wounded a police officer in Zagreb. People join the police because they want to help and protect people and protect fundamental rights. We owe it to these policemen and policewomen to strive for zero tolerance towards illegal and racial violence.  Of course, the European Union has limited competence in this area, but we are a community of values. Member States should promote and respect law enforcement rules in line with their national constitutions in full respect of human rights. Each incident of disproportionate or illegal use of violence brought to oversight bodies should be systematically subject to an in—depth administrative or judicial inquiry. National authorities should investigate individual cases and ensure that justice is served. They should publish the results of these investigations in order to build trust. But there is, of course, a lot that the European Union can do. This discussion is linked to the wider debate on institutional racism.  Our new EU anti—racist action plan includes action for fair policing and protection. For example, training and sharing our best practice at EU level to prevent discrimination, including racial or ethnic profiling, in law enforcement. Training is also key. The European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Training (CEPOL) can support Member States. CEPOL’s EU—level training could help create a common understanding of human rights and ethical conduct. What we lack is data. We will gather data on police attitudes towards minorities as part of our anti—racist action plan. What I also can and will do, is to put the topic on the agenda, coordinate and work with our agencies. I know Member States are already taking their responsibility. They already have, and still are, putting programmes in place to make sure that law enforcement upholds values and to prevent racism and xenophobia. But I want to make sure that we work together on this. Together with Europol and the German Presidency I am exploring an initiative to assess these existing programmes with European police chiefs, to share and promote the best practice and to identify possible common actions in the future.  I really look forward to listening to your contribution to this important debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "politicalGroup": "Verts/ALE", "partyIdeology": "Greens and regionalists"}, {"id": 159, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Vladimír BILČÍK", "mepid": "197771", "text": "  for the PPE Group. – Madam President, I would like us not to have this debate at all today. However, we must not remain silent. The reason we are here is the tragic story of Jozef Chovaovec. A Slovak citizen who died in police custody in Belgium following a dehonest intervention by police officers. Unfortunately, we are aware of several similar cases of police brutality from other European countries. Also in Slovakia, I have cases where police officers attack citizens just because they have a different skin color and the system subsequently protects these police officers.  The test of genuine Europeanity is therefore our ability to face up directly and in the face of all tragic cases of police brutality.  We need a sincere effort for truth, justice and redress in the case of the death of Jozef Chovaovec. In Europe, it must be the case that cases of police brutality are not concealed and obscured, they are dealt with immediately. Police officers on duty can never be the true guardians of the law in European democracy. Shocking footage in the case of Jozef Chovaovec shows that both civil and police training has failed in the Belgian security forces. We would not have discussed the death of Jozef Chovaovec today, had it not been for the mediated footage from the police cell and the pressure of diplomats and MPs. However, today's debate is neither a solution nor a patch on the problems that led to the death of a man who could and should have lived.  There's no problem if we refuse to admit it. This is true in many countries.

As to excessive police violence, incidents will always occur but what sets apart democratic rule of law from dictatorships, for example, is that there is a follow—up, that there is no impunity for excessive police violence. Here there is a big question mark over this case. The question is why was there no investigation? Why did we have to wait for the video to be published before the Belgian authorities started to move? And when are we actually going to get responses to these questions? This is not just a Belgian matter or a Slovak matter, because it concerns a Slovak citizen. It is very much a European matter because if one national system doesn’t function then the whole chain is broken. In the context of police and justice cooperation, we have to be able to rely on each other and to trust each other, and here there is clearly an issue and we need answers. That is also why the Democracy, Rule of Law and Fundamental Rights Monitoring Group is taking up the issue and this week we’re going to have a hearing. We will also be hearing Ms De Bolle, who is the head of Europol, but also the head of police in Belgium at the time. Finally, with regard to the broader issue of excess of police violence and racism, which has also been addressed by the Commissioner, I would like to repeat the call for a European police code of ethics, but also, I think, for training because in this case we are still waiting for the answers and the motives behind what happened, but I think many police people will also confirm that there are lots of police people who are just not adequately equipped for this kind of situation.

There are cases in France where police officers have been shot by drive-by attackers. Similar incidents have also been reported in the United States and other countries.

Of course it goes without saying that the behaviour of those police officers is deeply troubling, especially against the background of protests in the US against the killing of George Floyd. It need not be said that excessive, inappropriate use of force contravenes the European Convention on Human Rights, as well as the Belgian Constitution.  Now there was public outrage in Slovakia and Belgium and across Europe, and rightfully so, not least because the proper investigation only picked up steam after public pressure and after the video was released. And again, it goes without saying that there can be no discrimination when it comes to the treatment of EU citizens by the various police forces across Member States.

Above all, it is also painful for the state and its political representatives, because the security authorities, in a society in which the state has a monopoly on violence, also have a special responsibility, of course, for us to act decisively, resolutely against any inappropriate behaviour by the police and in our security authorities. Resolute action against racism, decisive action against homophobia, decisive action against anti-Gypsyism and nationalism.  And when we do that, we are protective of the many, many police officers who do an excellent job every day. They protect us as citizens, they protect our liberal democracies, they protect our rule of law, they protect what is important to us, what is valuable to us and what essentially makes us Europeans.

Such cases happen in many European countries, but they are surprisingly not accused of violating the rule of law. And yet it is then that we have a serious problem with it. In France, for example, 26 people were killed, including 11 during the yellow vest protests, and 2,000 injured as a result of police abuse. In addition, according to media reports, there have been 95 attacks by the French police on journalists. Recently, the European Court of Human Rights sentenced Spain in a trial for abuse of force by police officers who beat up participants in a legal protest. A tragic event has also occurred here in Belgium. Two years ago, Slovak national Józef Chovanec was detained at Charleroi Airport and fatally beaten by five police officers. One of the officers made a Nazi gesture and pretended to be Hitler. So far, no investigation has been carried out into this scandalous case. I therefore ask whether we will see a debate in the EP on violations of the rule of law in these countries?", "language": "en", "original_language": "pl", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "ECR", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}, "partyIdeology": "Christian democrats and conservatives"}, {"id": 183, "date": "2020-10-20.json", "name": "Sylwia SPUREK", "mepid": "197550", "text": "  I would like to write to the Commission. – On 7 August 2005, the European public witnessed the actions of the Polish Police, which raise great doubts as to respect for human rights and the proportionality of the measures used. As we have seen, a spontaneous gathering of activists and activists defending another activist, Margot, was broken up against the controversial arrest. As indicated by the participating respondents, as well as the Ombudsman and Polish parliamentarians, the actions of the Police and the way in which they are conducted raise doubts. In their opinion, the Police used inadequate coercive measures, both against those participating in the meeting and against bystanders, sometimes randomly detained, and the detainees did not subsequently have guaranteed the right of contact with a lawyer. The media also reported on the lack of safe conditions for detainees and possible sexual harassment of detainees at the command. Is the Police's action against LGBT+ people in 2020 the result of a hate policy pursued by the Law and Justice government and other right-wing parties that feel unpunished in the face of the indifference of the EU institutions, or already a systemic problem? Can citizens and citizens, especially the LGBT+ community, feel safe in their own country? Are these all standards in line with EU values?
