As is evident to everyone, we are still inside the COVID-19 emergency. We had hoped, with the summer break, to return to normality, but we found that our countries are still affected by the virus.  The progression of contagion has resumed in many of our territories and has prompted national governments to take containment measures.  That is why, on the basis of the information provided by the health services and the French authorities, I have taken the decision, with regret, not to hold the plenary session in Strasbourg in September.  I would like to thank the chairmen of the political groups for their support for this difficult decision and for expressing to the Conference of Presidents their full support for my decision to reinstate the Strasbourg session as soon as the health situation in the city and the security conditions allow us to return.  I am grateful to the French authorities for understanding the spirit of this decision and for their continued cooperation in these difficult months. On behalf of all Members, I would like to extend a warm greeting to the mayor and the citizens of Strasbourg, pending our return, which we hope will happen as soon as possible.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have received a report from many of you of a case of a Slovak citizen, Jozef Chovanec, who died after being held in custody at Charleroi airport in February 2018.  I would like to express my solidarity and solidarity with the family, with his loved ones, with his friends, and to emphasise once again that respect for human rights and the rule of law is a central value for the European Union.

Because they have expressed concern about a Poland, which we still remember in its recent accession to the European project, moving further and further away from European values. And, of course, that reason cannot have to do with the surreal explanation we've heard more than once that this is a leftist conspiracy. It's ridiculous.  The reason is serious. We are talking about an abrupt sequence of initiatives for institutional and legislative reforms, which have clearly raised the threatening news of a certain risk of serious violation of the founding values of the European Union enshrined in Article 2 of the Treaty on European Union. And that is the assumption on which the European Parliament launched the procedure referred to in Article 7, which is now at the Council table. And indeed, it is very worrying that sequence, which has been described more than once as constitutional breakdown, of constitutional collapse of the architecture of the rule of law, democracy and fundamental rights in Poland. Because to undermine the founding values of the European Union, democracy and rights in any Member State of the European Union — the case of Poland — is to do so throughout the European Union and is therefore an impact that undermines the credibility of the entire project of European construction, which goes directly against the project of coexistence governed by law — which is what this is all about and that is the rule of play— , with a court guaranteeing that legal order, which is the Court of Justice.  And we have found that this is resolution number ten which the European Parliament concentrates on Poland. There are seven specifically on Poland and three others on minority protection, equality and the state of fundamental rights in the European Union, which provide for very clear sections on the situation in Poland. And to be told that one more resolution might not make any difference in itself is an explanation of the extent to which this resolution is necessary and inevitable. Because Europe cannot allow neither the Resolutions of the European Parliament, nor the Commission's initiatives, nor the judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union to be systematically heard by any Member State of the European Union.  This resolution contains sixty-five paragraphs and, as chairman of the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, I have had the honour of being its rapporteur — the rapporteur of this European Parliament for this Resolution — and I have always tried to make it a precise, fact-in-law, factual resolution, and that it is also a resolution that flees from verbal excesses to tell exactly what are the main objects on which this sequence without precedents of abrupt institutional and legislative reforms, imposed by the majority holding the Government without anyone else in the Polish Sejm in the Polish Parliament, pose, yes, a certain risk of serious violation of the founding values of the European Union. They do so in matters of Constitutional Court, judiciary, judicial office and also disciplinary chamber, which has been classified as a Supreme Court within the Supreme Court.  These aspects relating to the separation of powers and the quality of the judiciary and the Public Prosecutor's Office in Poland — identified with the Ministry of Justice as in any other Member State of the European Union — have been hovered over as... occupation of the judiciary and abuse of the Public Prosecutor's Office. Four infringement proceedings in Article 158 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union have been initiated by the Commission. And four other judgments of the Court of Justice of the European Union have been systematically heard and ousted by the Polish authorities. Only one was partially received: that relating to the early retirement of a number of Supreme Court judges. The rest have been completely de-heard. But the Resolution also deals with other aspects, in addition to these aspects relating to the independence of the judiciary and the autonomy of the Public Prosecutor's Office in Poland. It also deals with restricted pluralism, with a serious restriction of political pluralism. It deals with rights and freedoms, which are increasingly agreed by these legislative reforms: freedom of assembly, freedom of protest, dissent and, above all, in the media; severe restriction of information pluralism. And a derogatory and threatening language towards minorities, anti-Semitic content in the last election campaign and, of course, those infamous LGBTI free zones, which have been declared by certain local administrations in Poland, which are radically incompatible with European law.  For all these reasons, this sixty-five-paragraph resolution is a resolution which seeks to be precise and contained and therefore launches a message: Commission, Council, do its job and carry out Article 7.  And I conclude by saying: this message is a message for Poland to return to the values of the Union to which it belongs, so that Poland may return to the European Union, to which it belongs. And this European Parliament is not an extraterrestrial spacecraft, nor is it any foreign power in Poland, but represents Polish citizenship, which, as it is, is European. And, therefore, Parliament defends European citizenship and Polish citizenship.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 9, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Dear colleague, I would inform you that you have now used your six minutes of speaking time, with speaking time at the end, so I cannot give you the floor at the end of the debate.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 10, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Marc ANGEL", "mepid": "202073", "text": "   author. – Mr President, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Juan Fernando López Aguilar, for underlining that Article 7 should encompass not only the rule of law but also fundamental rights and democracy. As the co-chair of the LGBTI Intergroup, I am particularly happy that LGBTI rights in Poland are strongly addressed. The amendments the Intergroup proposed and which were adopted by the S&amp;D rapporteur and supported by four other groups specifically target the fears and the realities that LGBTI persons are experiencing in Poland. This includes hate speech by high political officials and, more recently, police brutality during the mass arrests of LGBTI activists this summer during the Polish ‘Stonewall’. Apart from cutting EU funds under the city-twinning programmes, which we highly welcome, the Commission’s lack of action regarding LGBTI-free zones is worrying. Last April the Court of Justice of the European Union recognised in the Rete Lenford case that homophobic statements can constitute discrimination in employment. Therefore, the LGBTI Intergroup asks the Commission if it agrees that LGBTI free-zone declarations risk discriminating against LGBTI persons in employment and occupation. Will the Commission start an infringement procedure based on the EU Directive on Equal Treatment in Employment? The Polish LGBTI community needs the Commission to take stronger action. What concrete steps will the Commission take to protect it, especially when it comes to protecting human rights defenders, like the authors of the ‘Atlas of Hate’? We must keep in mind that attacks on the rights of LGBTI people are a serious threat to Fundamental Rights everywhere in our Union. Throughout the whole summer, thanks to the webinars of the LGBTI Intergroup and of Rainbow Rose, I listened to many testimonies from Polish LGBTI people.

Let me also thank the rapporteur, Mr López Aguilar, for his work on the report, and also the authors of the oral question. I would like to take this opportunity to present the key developments that have occurred since the last plenary debate on the situation in Poland.  Let me start with the new legislation on the judiciary of 20 December 2019, which entered into force in February this year. The Commission came to the conclusion that this law undermines the judicial independence of Polish judges and is incompatible with the primacy of EU law. In particular, it prevents Polish courts from directly applying certain provisions of EU law protecting judicial independence and from putting references for preliminary rulings on such questions to the Court of Justice. For this reason, on 28 April 2020, the Commission opened a new infringement proceeding against Poland by addressing to it a letter of formal notice. The Commission has received the reply from the Polish authorities and will soon decide on the next steps in this procedure.  As regards the new disciplinary regime for judges in Poland, upon the Commission’s request for interim measures, on 8 April 2020, the European Court of Justice ruled that Poland must immediately suspend the application of national provisions concerning the powers of the Disciplinary Chamber of the Supreme Court. The order applies until the Court has rendered its final judgment in the pending infringement procedure. Following this order, a judge of the Disciplinary Chamber referred a legal question to the Polish Constitutional Tribunal contesting the constitutionality of treaty provisions on which the order for interim measures is based. The referral is still pending with the Constitutional Tribunal.  I would like to underline that the order of the European Court of Justice is binding. It takes immediate effect and must be implemented by the Member State concerned. As made clear by the case-law of the European Court of Justice, the binding nature of the orders of the Court cannot be questioned on the basis of national laws or rulings of national courts, even on the basis of national constitutional provisions. Commissioner Reynders sent a letter to the Polish authorities regarding the implementation of the interim measures order, expressing concerns and asking for clarifications and further information. The Commission is currently analysing the reply from Poland and the situation on the ground as regards the arrangements put in place to comply with the order.  A further development is that the Disciplinary Chamber has been seized by the prosecution services in cases requesting the lifting of the judicial immunity of judges for the purpose of pursuing criminal investigations, including in cases which concern the contents of judicial decisions. On 6 June 2020, the Disciplinary Chamber rejected such a request and it is expected to re-examine this case in appeal in October. Other such cases have also been scheduled by the Disciplinary Chamber. The Commission is closely following these developments. As regards the situation in the Supreme Court, a number of further developments have taken place. On 20 April 2020, the Constitutional Tribunal held that the resolution of the Supreme Court of 23 January 2020, implementing the preliminary ruling of the European Court of Justice of 19 November 2019, was void. That resolution found that judges appointed at the request of the new National Council for the Judiciary are not permitted to adjudicate cases, and also invalidated all the rulings handed down by members of the Disciplinary Chamber. As regards the appointment of the new First President of the Supreme Court, the new law on the judiciary amended the procedure for appointment. Following the expiration of the mandate of the previous First President on 25 May 2020, the President of the Republic appointed a new First President of the Supreme Court.  There was also a relevant development relating to the execution of European Arrest Warrants with regard to Poland. In the course of this year, some Member State courts suspended the execution of the European Arrest Warrant due to further concerns regarding judicial independence in Poland. Most recently, the court of Amsterdam temporarily suspended the execution of two European Arrest Warrants to Poland submitted to it until the European Court of Justice has rendered its answers regarding two requests for a preliminary ruling. This shows that there is a real concern of mutual trust in the judiciary, which is very worrying. Finally, let me note that recently the Ministry of Justice announced that works are under way to prepare a second part of the justice reform. So far no legislative proposal is on the table. While justice reforms to improve its efficiency are always welcome, the manner in which the judiciary in Poland might be further reformed should not deepen the existing rule-of-law concerns. To conclude I regret to say that the recent developments show that the situation has not improved since the last plenary debate in February. Rule-of-law concerns still persist, and let me state clearly that the Commission will use all the instruments at its disposal to address them. This includes infringements in cases of breach of EU law, but infringements are only one tool and not all rule-of-law concerns can be addressed through infringements.  It is therefore essential also to have an open dialogue with the Polish authorities and stakeholders. Since the beginning of the mandate, the Commission has expressed its readiness for dialogue. We are open to having such a dialogue with the Polish authorities in an objective manner and with a mutual aim of solving existing problems. The upcoming first annual Rule of Law Report, covering all Member States, which the Commission will adopt soon, can be a further basis for such dialogue. This report has been prepared through a transparent process with the engagement of Member States, based on a common methodology and in an objective manner. A joint effort is needed to address the rule-of-law matters involving all the European institutions and the Commission appreciates the continuous support of the European Parliament in that respect. I also welcome the fact that the German Presidency has put on the agenda of the General Affairs Council on 22 September 2020 a state-of-play item concerning the situation of the rule of law in Poland. We also need to reinforce our rule-of-law toolbox by a mechanism in the framework of protecting the future EU budget, and the Commission made a proposal in this regard in 2018.  I am also grateful for the opportunity to react to your oral question on the situation of the LGBTI community in Poland. The Commission has received numerous petitions and letters about discriminatory language, false accusations and hate speech used in Poland. We are also fully aware of the fact that more than a hundred regions and municipalities have adopted charters, declarations and resolutions, several of which regrettably demonstrate the aim to deny fundamental rights and freedoms to LGBTI people. I want to stress the following: equality for all and equality in all of its senses is one of the major priorities of President von der Leyen. The Commission strongly condemns any form of discrimination, violence and hatred against LGBTI people and activists and is committed to fighting any form of discrimination in the EU. It has always made clear that discrimination against LGBTI people has no place in the European Union. All EU Member States and state authorities alike, without exception, must respect EU values and fundamental rights. As indicated by the honourable Members, the Court of Justice of the EU has recently clarified the interpretation of the Equal Treatment Directive with regard to public declarations expressing a discriminatory opinion or intention about the potential recruitment of LGBTI persons. The Court referred to several factors which have to be taken into consideration in assessing whether such declarations are covered by the directive. The Court pointed out that these issues are of a factual nature.  The declarations issued by Polish regional or municipal councils vary in their nature. Some seem mainly to focus on education or so—called ideology, whereas others also refer to the selection of employees, albeit in a rather vague way. The Commission has not yet received any specific complaint by any person alleging violation of his or her rights derived from EU law following the adoption of the above declarations. However, the Commission is thoroughly examining the situation in the light of the prohibition of discrimination enshrined in the EU acquis. It is assessing the precise purpose, scope and effects of the declarations at issue in view of a possible violation of EU law. Should there be a violation, the Commission, as guardian of the EU Treaties, will make use of its powers.  The Commission has already, on several occasions, encouraged the Polish authorities to revoke discriminatory resolutions, charters and similar statements. It has reminded the Polish authorities of the importance of promoting respect for fundamental rights and freedoms, social inclusion, gender equality and combating discrimination.  We stand ready to support the Polish authorities in combating discrimination, including on the basis of sexual orientation. The Commission – my colleague Helena Dalli – will present an LGBTI equality strategy in November this year. Within this framework, the Commission will continue to provide appropriate funding to foster a conducive and sustainable environment for LGBTI civil-society organisations. In addition, the Commission will maintain and encourage a structured and open dialogue and consultation with civil society. EU values and fundamental rights must be respected by Member States and state authorities alike. Discrimination against LGBTI people has no place in the EU and the Commission will continue to fight against all kinds of discrimination.

And since then we see Poland crossing red line after red line, and the strategy of the Member States is appeasement. But in the meantime, the situation has got worse, obviously. We see LGBTI-free zones in Poland, in Europe, the return of witch hunts in Europe – something I thought I would never see. Today several NGOs have lodged a legal complaint at the Commission regarding the LGBTI-free zones, and judges in other EU Member States are now refusing to cooperate with judges in Poland and to use the European Arrest Warrant. Such civic action is very welcome, but why are the Commission and the Council not doing their job on this? Because frankly, Madam Commissioner, after three years I don’t want to hear the word ‘dialogue’ anymore. We’ve been in dialogue with Mr Orbán for 10 years and look at where we are now. It is impunity: dialogue equals impunity by now. It is time for action. I understand that Commissioner Jourová and Commissioner Reynders are ready to take action and to pursue the two pending procedures which are in court, but you’re being blocked by Ms von der Leyen.

But Ms von der Leyen, it’s time to act, it’s time to deliver, and I do not want to hear her say anymore that nobody is perfect –because impunity is encouraging other governments inside and outside Europe.

One example among many: the report highlights the bias of the media in Poland. But, objectively, in which country in the world would the media be impartial? Let's be careful. Moreover, the stigmatization of LGBT people after the return to power of the conservative Law and Justice party in 2015 remains to be supported. The arrest of militants is not a generality.

If you think that I’m exaggerating the situation, or that I’m overstating something, I would like to give you one number, and maybe you are going to rethink that judgment. Currently 10% of all Polish judges, one in ten – in some districts, every single judge – is under urgent threat of being targeted with disciplinary measures.  What was their crime? They think that defending the rule of law and defending the independence of the judiciary is something that you can actually say out loud.  This is an unprecedented attack on EU values and the very foundation of the European Union, and probably not one, not two, and maybe not even five, Court of Justice of the Eureopan Union rulings are going to be enough when the ruling party is trying to take political control of the judiciary.

The silence of the Commission over this summer has been screaming into the faces of all of those people whose rights are under attack right now.

I say to Ms Reintke: there is only a left-wing activist who creates displays and illegal signs and sends you a picture and you believe it. So once again I call on you to maintain the seriousness of your office. But to get to the point: thank you very much for providing us, at last, with a definition of the rule of law. In your interpretation, the rule of law in Poland is being violated by, firstly, the adoption of the anti-terrorist law – even if you know there are similar laws in the other Member States. Secondly, by the appointment of the judges – which is done in the same way as in Spain. You know, in Poland the judicial council is appointed by parliament, like in Spain, by the same majority as in Spain, and you say: ‘In Spain everything is good but in Poland you harm the rule of law’. And this is equal treatment? Then in your definition, the existence of just one big Conservative television channel harms the rule of law. And merely holding a debate on abortion – not approving anything, only having a debate – harms the rule of law, in your definition. And the adoption of a solution in civil law to defend the good name of Poland, which is a fundamental right of every citizen and every country, you say that this is still harming the rule of law. Then the prohibition of the political activities of judges, which is a fundamental thing for the independence of judges – and we have this in the Constitution, by the way – in your opinion this is against the rule of law. The same thing when we don’t provide leftist organisations with more money out of public funds. And finally, the adoption of Regional Family Rights Law. Yes, it is true: in your interpretation, defending family law is harming the rule of law. So to conclude: everything which is not leftist is harming the rule of law in your interpretation. That’s why I need to ask you something: did you even understand what the rule of law is? Do you know what democracy is? The fundamental thing about democracy and European values is freedom of speech, freedom of expression, and the right to create a political group, a Christian political group, a Conservative political group, like Robert Schuman did. I need to tell you something: we in Poland know this kind of ideology. In the past, the Communists used the language of ‘I tell you...’. The Communists called censorship ‘the principles of freedom’: the restriction of religious practice, the freedom of conscience. And today you call a left-wing bandit beating a man a child who has been arrested for his beliefs, and supporting the traditional family you call an ‘attack on tolerance’. I tell you something, and I want to underline something: I am not surprised that the new monument in Germany of Lenin – a murderer, a tyrant – does not bother you.

Let me start with with a recollection of how we felt about the rule of law and values some years ago, maybe 10 years ago. We used to speak about the independent judges and about the freedom of speech and a vibrant civil society, free and fair elections. It was with a very relaxed voice, as if we had created some kind of perpetuum mobile for values in the EU. Now we see that we have to deploy all possible powers and measures to renew the importance of the values like rule of law, fundamental rights and democracy to the European Union, because these are the values the EU was thus founded on.  And speaking about measures, I indeed described what we do in the field of infringement procedures. We can only use them when there is a clear violation of EU law. It might sound legalistic. It is. It is a legal approach, as Ms Delbos-Corfield mentioned, but we, the Commission, are not activists.  We can only start infringement procedures when we have a very solid legal ground, and believe me, I want to win the cases. We cannot afford to lose the cases which relate to rule of law issues. It’s too important, and we need also to work on the credibility of the EU, and losing the cases would not be a good thing. That’s why I wanted to attract your attention also to the previous cases where they were all successful. And important cases relating to rule of law. Article 7: we obviously see that there was a lack of imagination in those who created the Lisbon Treaty, who foresaw the Article 7 as a functional measure. We see now that it’s toothless. We have lengthy procedures, we have the debate about Hungary and Poland, and it’s not only Hungary supporting Poland and vice versa. There are other Member States who are supporting States where we see obvious breach of the basic principle of the rule of law.  So we have to deploy further measures. Obviously, we have to accelerate more and more powers and to be also innovative in how to support the rule of law in the Member States. That’s why we proposed the rule of law conditionality, the linkage between the rule of law principle and the budget.  You know that there was a very difficult debate on the night of 21 June when the Council was adopting the new budget, and the talks will continue. I do believe that we need such an instrument. I sometimes say in a rather cynical way that whoever doesn’t understand the values usually understands the money. Let’s use this instrument. We need it. And also because the taxpayers of many Member States are fed up with funding projects in the countries where fundamental rights are violated. And here I come also to the issue of the breach of the rights of the LGBTI people. Where we are now with the budget is a very dangerous situation. The bigger the money, the lower the trust. I think that this is devastating. We need to promote the idea of linking the EU taxpayers’ money with the basic principles of the EU.  The second measure which we want to use is also a response to the criticism which I heard from this side of Parliament that that is double or triple standards, different treatments, that we are only focusing on Poland and Hungary. It was never my goal. I always wanted to make a very objective and fair comparison of the situation of the rule of law in the Member States and it cannot be done by comparing two laws or two articles in two different laws in Germany and Poland or in Hungary and Spain. We have to look at the broader picture in all the Member States. That’s why we are now finishing the work on the rule of law report where we will focus not only on the situation of the judiciary but also on media and on the anti-corruption fight, because we believe that these are interconnected features and factors and we should be able to make an objective assessment.  The way of assessing is very transparent. Also the authorities in Poland and all the other Member States had a possibility to comment on the findings and we will soon make the reports public and make further comments. Indeed, it was also said here, we need a better definition of what we mean by the rule of law. We will do that. We will always make better and better explanations because we also simply have to explain on a continuous basis to the citizens of the EU why we need the rule of law principle in place, why we need an independent judge. There is a lack of awareness of how important the principle is for every single citizen.  So I believe that these two new instruments will help to increase our ability. Now it will be a quote in many of your speeches to do ‘something;. We need to do something more.  My objective is also – and it is the reaction of Sophia in ‘t Veld – that there has been enough dialogue. My objective is to continue the dialogue because Poland is an EU Member State, and I really want to invite Poland back to Europe where we esteem and respect values. Sorry I am long. On the LGBTI issue, I am in permanent contact with the Polish Ombudsman. We have strengthened the competences of equality bodies which are available for LGBTI people. We need to be clearer that the financial resources of the EU will not be paid in case there is such a violation of the fundamental rights of people. And it was a good thing that we stopped the funding of the six projects because there was no clarification of what’s happening there.  I was happy to see also the peer pressure of other municipalities which didn’t want to cooperate, because what we see in some of the municipalities is a big worry that the LGBTI people are under big threat. Moreover, when we hear the aggressive rhetoric against LGBTI people from the political circles, it is a kind of authorisation to do the same thing for the whole society. I find this intolerable. The Commission will continue working on this issue. You said that you don’t want to hear anything about monitoring and analysing. Well we are now analysing how to react to the declarations elaborated by the municipalities because the legal issue is that they are not laws or sub-laws which could be addressed by the infringement procedure, but we are trying to find a way. And from this place I would like to send a lot of encouragement to LGBTI people because Europe is standing behind them.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 39, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Juan Fernando LÓPEZ AGUILAR", "mepid": "96812", "text": "  Rapporteur. – Mr President, thank you for your generosity in granting me one last minute simply to thank you for the livelyness of this debate.

Mr Aguilar, whose report we are debating, has effectively erased the fact that in Spain the Council for the Judiciary is elected in the same way as in Poland, that is, through parliament, but it is in Poland that the rule of law is being violated and in Spain it is not.  He also forgot about the Dantej scenes in his country, where the police brutally pacified demonstrations in Catalonia without sparing women and the elderly. How does this have to do with the right to organize assemblies and peacefully manifest their views? Similar situations have been observed in France during protests by workers and trade unions. In Poland, for five years, since Law and Justice was in power, opposition demonstrations have been protected, not dispersed by the police.

Mr President, representatives of the Council and the Commission. I should like to begin by apologising to my colleague, Mr Buoi, who cannot be here today, and I should therefore like to put this question to the Council and the Commission on behalf of the Committee on the Environment. On 11 March 2019, the Commission adopted its Communication entitled 'The European Union's strategic approach to medicinal products in the environment'. Article 8c of the Priority Substances Directive provides that the present strategic approach should, where appropriate, be followed by proposals for measures to be taken at Union and/or Member State level to address the possible environmental impact of pharmaceutical substances, thereby reducing discharges, emissions and losses of these substances into water, taking into account the needs of public health and the cost-effectiveness of the proposed measures. The Communication identifies six areas of action and several specific activities related to possible measures: increased education and promotion of prudent use of medicinal products, support for the development of medicines that are less harmful to the environment, and promotion of more environmentally friendly production, improvement of environmental impact assessment and its review, reduction of waste and improvement of waste management, evaluation of environmental monitoring and closing other knowledge gaps.  I would therefore like to turn to the questions, firstly on the Council: in its conclusions of June 2019, the Council calls on the Commission to assess and identify the joint measures, including initiatives, to reduce the environmental impact of medicines and to combat the development of resistance to antimicrobial agents and, in this respect, to strengthen the introduction to the health sector. Hence the two questions: what is the Council's position on the strategic approach and the measures set out by the Commission? Secondly, what legislative and non-legislative measures does the Council intend to support in order to reduce the risk of medicines in the environment?  The second question to the Commission is that there is sufficient evidence that rapid action should be taken to reduce the risk of medicinal products in the environment. The two questions: what legislative and non-legislative measures does the Commission intend to take to reduce the risk of medicines in the environment?  Secondly, what is the timetable for these measures?", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 2, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 46, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  Thank you very much, Mr President, ladies and for inquiries.

Mr President, honourable Members, I sometimes take the right to be here if you have not invited me decisively. However, I am particularly honoured to be able to convey the Council's position on this important issue, honourable Members, because you are quite right: there is growing evidence that residues of certain medicines in the soil and water pose a major risk to animal and human health, and, furthermore, these residues can also cause environmental damage. What seems to be particularly dangerous are the residues of antimicrobials used in humans and also in livestock farming; they are a particularly big problem. Antimicrobial resistance is a serious and global threat to public health. Their effects go beyond the serious consequences for human and animal health. It also affects agriculture and food production, and thus trade and economic growth. Antimicrobial resistance significantly limits the ability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. The Council is aware of the environmental risks associated with the manufacture, use and disposal of medicinal products. It stresses that measures must be in line with the concept of 'health', which takes into account the interaction between human and animal health and the environment. Efforts in just one sector alone are not enough.  For this reason, Ministers in both the Environment And Health Councils welcomed the Commission's communication on the EU's strategic approach to medicines in the environment. In its strategic approach, the Commission has identified six areas where improvements can be made. These improvements, which can be achieved at all stages of the life cycle of medicines, contribute to the achievement of the goal of sustainable development of Europe by 2030. In addition, the Commission is right to take the view that, for the purpose of their effectiveness, the measures should not only include controls at the end of the pipeline, i.e. improved waste water treatment. They should also consider the original sources of emissions, such as production, disposal and use.  The EU is a strong global player, particularly on environmental issues, and that is why we all have a duty to strengthen cooperation on this important issue at international level. This, too, is part of the proposed strategy.  The Council looks forward to the new Pharmaceutical Strategy for Europe, which the Commission intends to present this autumn. In this light, we will certainly have to consult. Finally, I would like to point out once again that the Commission's communication on medicinal products in the environment focuses on measures that will start, be initiated and, in some cases, finalised. The Commission has stated that it will take stock of the progress made and decide on further steps. In the light of this proposal, the Council is ready to review all the results and, if necessary, to change its position again in the interests of the environment and in the interests of the protection of animals and human beings.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 48, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Virginijus Sinkevičius", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, I would like to thank you and the Members for tabling the oral questions and for including this important issue on the agenda of this week’s plenary session. There is overwhelming evidence that traces of pharmaceuticals in water and soil endanger wildlife such as fish, birds and insects, and have an adverse impact on the environment. Pharmaceuticals are now found across Europe’s surface water, and have even reached our drinking water, even if not in quantities that cause immediate concern. Effective medication must remain fully available to citizens. We all agree on this – in the light of the ongoing sanitary crisis probably more than ever. At the same time, we must avoid that there is an undue impact of pharmaceuticals on the environment, because this is the other aspect of which the pandemic has reminded us so strongly: that our health and well—being depends so heavily on a healthy environment. In 2019, the Commission put forward the European strategic approach to pharmaceuticals in the environment. My colleague Stella Kyriakides and I, together, we are leading work within the Commission on this important matter. We are pleased that the Council and Parliament have shown support for the approach, focusing on the entire life cycle of pharmaceuticals. Today, and in reply to the points you raised in your oral questions, I am glad to report that we have made good progress in implementing the different actions we announced and proposed last year. For example, additional pharmaceuticals were included in the revised watch—list under the Water Framework Directive in August this year. For example, additional pharmaceuticals were included for veterinary and medical products, and implementing and delegated acts are currently being drafted under the regulation on veterinary medical products. They also aim to promote more prudent use of antimicrobials and implement new rules on oral medication. The Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation already reduces emissions during manufacturing of pharmaceuticals through authorisation of used substances. But an effective reduction of the impact of pharmaceuticals on the environment cannot be achieved at EU level without strong engagement also at the level of national health authorities, the pharmaceutical industry and health professionals. In the medicines area, we have started working with Member States’ health ministries, for instance to make sure health professionals are aware of environmental impacts, and we encourage initiatives taken in some Nordic countries to use public procurement as a tool to promote pharmaceuticals that are produced in a green manner. The European Medicines Agency is currently working on updated guidelines on environmental risk assessment for human medical products, and in the waste sector, new guidelines will be developed on collecting schemes for unused medicines. In the area of research, the ongoing Horizon 2020 programme is co—founding solution—oriented research, as illustrated, for example, by a wide—ranging study on contaminants of emerging concern, pathogens and antimicrobial resistance in the water cycle. All EU actions are closely aligned with World Health Organisation (WHO) guidance, and dialogues are established at political and technical level with manufacturing countries outside the EU, offering opportunities to raise concerns regarding the impact associated with the production of pharmaceuticals, especially antibiotics. We will, of course, continue to address pharmaceuticals in the environment in very concrete actions and the various upcoming deliverables under the European Green Deal, like the chemicals strategy and the zero—pollution action plan, and also under the upcoming pharmaceutical strategy, which my colleague Stella Kyriakides is preparing for the end of the year. Also, the farm—to—fork strategy, presented earlier this year, includes an important target. To reduce by 50% by 2030 the overall EU sales of antimicrobials for farmed animals and in aquaculture. Furthermore, in the follow-up to the evaluation of the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, we are looking at ways to tackle micropollutants, including pharmaceuticals, which still pass through our waste water treatment plants. All these are concrete examples that illustrate the progress we are making to alleviate the impact of pharmaceuticals in the environment. The issue will remain high on our political agenda, and I can reassure you that we will continue to pursue our efforts together with you, with Member States and with the industry, and, of course, with the professionals, to stay on track and make the necessary progress using both legislative and non—legislative means. I look forward to working very closely with you on this crucial topic.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 5, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 49, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "  A motion for a resolution has been tabled in accordance with Rule 136(5) of the Rules of Procedure*.

Today we give the green light, with the approval that will take place this week, not only for the introduction of the new own resource but above all for the implementation of the Recovery Fund. With our decision, with our opinion, the Council can immediately proceed with the approval decision-making process, which must be unanimously in the Council, and then ratification by national parliaments in the light of the Constitution of each Member State. We are working very quickly because we want the Recovery Fund ready and available in January 2021 - as early as 1 January - and my question now to the Council, and to the Council representative, the Minister, is: when will the Council adopt this decision? It is that we have called on the Council to immediately adopt this decision on new own resources because we know that ratification usually takes between a year and a half to two years, and it is urgent for the citizens of the European Union who expect this Recovery Fund, it is essential for the economy, for competitiveness, and it is also essential for territorial cohesion , economic and social. This Recovery Fund also brings a new challenge: we have after paying interest and amortization and new own resources are a solution.  We do not want to burden the citizens of the European Union. We also do not want to penalise future generations and cut programmes and cut European Union policies, and so we advocate new own resources on a simple principle: they should be enough to at least pay interest and pay the repayments. We know well that in this Recovery Fund from 2021 to 2027, we will only have 12.9 billion euros for interest, but then by 2058 we will have to pay interest and we will have to pay the repayments, and I hope that the Council will agree with this principle: it takes new own resources to pay the interest and to pay the repayments , because we do not want to ask the Member States for more money, because that would mean asking citizens for more taxes. On the other hand, we cannot penalise future generations, we cannot have policy cuts, and our proposal is simple and based on principles that everyone should also agree with. For example, those who do not pay must pay, and so we ask that the giants of digital be taxed. In addition, we want to strengthen the competitiveness of the European Union and therefore the carbon border mechanism is a possibility for us to strengthen competitiveness, to have revenues and to invite other countries that do not have the same environmental standards to contribute to the objective of combating climate change as well. And therefore, the new own resources, in addition to not penalising the citizens of the European Union, must be in line with the Union's objectives and policies, combating climate change, or enhancing competitiveness. And something that we also consider very important is that, in addition to linking the new own resources to interest and amortisation, it was very important that interest and repayments were counted above the rules of the multiannual financial framework.", "language": "en", "original_language": "pt", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "PPE", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 54, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Valérie HAYER", "mepid": "135511", "text": "  Rapporteur. Mr President, Commissioner, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, our report answers a legitimate question that everyone is asking. This loan of 750 billion euros is good, it's fabulous, it's historic, really. But who's going to pay it back? Three possibilities. The first possibility is that we are taking money from European programmes to pay off this debt, which we would be pulling out like a ball in our feet until 2058. We should then explain to young people that they can no longer go to Erasmus, to farmers that food sovereignty depends on a reduction in the CAP, to the unemployed that the European Social Fund can no longer finance their reintegration. Who to understand and explain this? The second possibility is that states are repaying this debt through an increase in national contributions, i.e. higher taxes on European citizens. I will be very clear: these two solutions are absolutely unacceptable. Those who have lost their jobs or incomes as a result of the crisis do not have to pay for the recovery, either through additional taxes or through fewer opportunities. For us MEPs, there is a third option, the only viable one for us. To do this, we will have to cross the Rubicon, assume the obvious: that of the creation of new own resources. For all the pro-Europeans, of which I am a member, this is obvious: the evidence that the Union is the optimal level to ensure fiscal justice on a continent-wide scale. It should be noted that we are not reinventing the wheel. What we are defending is only the legal translation of what the Heads of State and Government decided at this summit on 21 July in their politically binding conclusions. So I can already hear, here and there, the proponents of Europe shouting at an imaginary tax on European households. Well, I look you straight in the eye, you who are on the extreme right of this Chamber. Will you be able to explain to your countrymen tomorrow that by dogmatism you refuse to protect their wallets? What an irony for those who self-establish themselves as protectors of the little people against the greats of this world. Do you think it is normal that today the digital giants, which have emerged strengthened from this crisis, still do not contribute to the right level of their profits even though many Europeans have to go and eat away at their savings? Do you think it is normal that large Chinese companies, which export massively to Europe products with a staggering carbon footprint and ultra-aggressive prices, without being subject to the same standards, do not compensate for their environmental impact? Do you still think it is normal for multinationals to practice tax optimisation, financial institutions to speculate excessively or to maintain tax dumping in Europe? Well, I don't think it's normal. It is these players who have to pay for the recovery. I do not want the Europeans to be involved. Of course, this will require political will and courage. Commissioner, Minister, you will understand that this report, which we are debating today, is not just a somewhat complex budget report, a bit 'techno', a bit repulsive. No, what we are discussing today goes much further. What we are defending today is a Europe in which states no longer run out every seven years, during long summits of several days, in order to determine what their rate of return is or how to buy rich but stingy states with indecent discounts. The choice that is about to be made between the States and the European parliamentarians is absolutely crucial. It will determine whether the Union is heading irretrievably towards an international organisation status, such as WHO, whose survival depends solely on the goodwill of its Member States, or whether the Union will finally be armed with its own means to uphold its standards and values, to ensure the next generation of Europeans a prosperous and green future, free of all debt. , if not recognition.", "language": "en", "original_language": "fr", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 55, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Michael Roth", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   President-in-Office of the Council. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin by thanking the rapporteur for her excellent report, which is a very The year 2020 will go down in the history of a united Europe.  The planned reform of the own resources system is a paradigm shift for the European Union. I hope that we are all aware of this particular responsibility in these extraordinary times. Because we all know that the own resources system, as long as it exists, has been highly controversial in all the institutions of the European Union. Not only with you, honourable Members, but also in the Council and the Commission. What we have now achieved, of course, has something to do with crisis – a serious crisis and an extraordinary crisis that has claimed many lives. Once again, the European Union has managed to send out a proper signal of capacity for action and solidarity. The Next Generation EU programme plays a prominent role in this. A large amount of EUR 750 billion is available to the states, the regions and the people who have suffered the most from the pandemic. But – and Here I can only agree with the honourable rapporteur – the money must, of course, flow quickly so that it arrives where it is really needed.  This requires a new decision on the own resources system. Only this own resources decision gives the Commission the opportunity to borrow the appropriate financial resources on the capital markets. It provides a basis for rapid and comprehensive action in this exceptional crisis. I can assure you, honourable Members, that the Council is aware of its particular responsibility at this difficult time, and you can guess that the decision on this far-reaching reform in the European Council was not easy. But we have achieved this with courage and foresight and solidarity. I would like to introduce you once again to the most important elements of the draft decision. Firstly, the EUR 750 billion in funding under the 'Next Generation EU' programme. However, it is also a question of opening the door to new own resources. There has also been a long and controversial debate on this, the rapporteur. The European Council has taken this wish into account. We will start in 2021 with a new tax, the plastic levy, based on the amount of plastic packaging waste that is not recycled. The draft decision of the European Council goes even further, because other own resources are also outlined. The proposal is on the table for new levies to be launched during the 2021-2027 Multiannual Financial Framework. We are talking about a CO2 limit equalisation levy and also about the digital levy, which you are well aware of. It is also a question of a revised proposal for the emissions trading scheme. In its conclusions, the European Council also identified a possible path for the financial transaction tax to be introduced across the EU. It is precisely this path that shows the opportunity associated with this own resources decision.  I can therefore assure you that we all have a great interest in getting a decision as soon as possible so that the Multiannual Financial Framework, but also the Next Generation EU instrument, can be financed. Once again, I would like to express my thanks to the chairman of the committee, Mr Van Overtveldt, but also to the rapporteur, Mrs Hayer, and to the rapporteur, Mr Fernandes. It was only through their efforts that it was possible for the plenary of the European Parliament to deal with this important decision so quickly. I can assure you – and this was also Mr Fernandes's question – that the Council also wants to bring about a decision as soon as possible, and of course also in the light of your deliberations. However, I would also like to use this debate once again as an opportunity to bring you something that we should not underestimate. We cannot look at and debate the own resources decision in isolation from the overall package, that is, the MFF, the 'Next Generation EU' and also other matters, such as the conditionality of the rule of law. That is why we must keep this package together. I therefore ask you to work hard and constructively with us over the next few days and weeks to ensure that we reach a comprehensive agreement on this overall package as quickly as possible.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 56, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Othmar KARAS", "mepid": "4246", "text": "   Ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has I am sorry that I have to interrupt you briefly shortly before the speech by the Budget Commissioner, Johannes Hahn, because I have to open today's voting round.

First, it has taken a pivotal decision to borrow on financial markets to support the post-COVID-19 recovery in the Member States. This will be enabled through the Own Resources Decision. Next Generation EU, together with the core multiannual financial framework, is the largest package ever financed through the European Union budget. It will give an unprecedented, ambitious answer to an unprecedented crisis. Second, the European Council has opened the door for modernisation of the own-resources system, which has not been reformed since 1988. This marks the first modernisation for more than half of our Member States – 16 out of 27.   The European Council endorsed the simplification of the value-added-tax-based own resource, and agreed upon a new own resource based on non-recycled plastic packaging waste as of 2021, and these are only the first steps, as it has also agreed that additional new own resources should be introduced during the next multiannual financial framework period – from 2021-2027 – to finance the repayment of the Next Generation EU borrowing and enable early repayments.  The European Parliament and the Commission have for a long time worked towards reform of the revenue side of the EU budget. It’s very encouraging that the Member States have begun to see what we have been advocating for so long. We have clearly managed to give a new drive to the Own Resource Decision, and I would like to thank the European Parliament for its support, and, may I say, stubbornness.  Let me go more into detail on the report you are set to adopt during this plenary. You foresee an ambitious timeline for the introduction of additional new own resources in your report. We see eye to eye. The Commission concurs with the need to introduce additional new own resources which are closely aligned with our policy priorities and can support the repayment of funds on the Next Generation EU. I am happy to see that there are points of convergence with the European Council conclusions of last July. This makes me hopeful that it will be feasible to introduce new own resources in the short term. In fact, preparatory work has already begun. We spare no efforts to match ambitions with the reality of the political and legal process. As you know, this is also one of the main issues of the trilateral political dialogue meetings on the MFF. Compared to the financial crisis of 2008-2009, Europe’s response to this crisis was exceptional in both strength and speed. You are set to adopt your report less than two months after the European Council at unprecedented pace. It is indeed commendable and thank you for that.  I am confident that the Council and national parliaments will follow your lead, thus facilitating the beginning of borrowing on the Next Generation EU already in January. To conclude, let me just underline that we would want to see the negotiations on the entire package, including the core MFF, progressing with the same impressive pace. Only in this way can we kick-start a recovery phase as of 1 January next year, with an ambitious and comprehensive recovery plan for Europe, so we need it now and not next year.

Firstly, I would like to express on behalf of the Group of the European People’s Party our full support for the report and for the positions expressed by the two rapporteurs, Ms Valerie Hayer and Mr José Manuel Fernandes. Why do we support this report? We support it because the introduction of own resources makes the European Union stronger, it makes it more capable to provide answers and solutions to the problems of the people, because one of the essential tools of the European Union to fulfil the expectations of the people is the budget. And own resources into the budget means a more predictable budget, which means a robust budget in the longer term, capable of financing what the people expect the European Union to finance. This reform of the own resources system and the introduction of new own resources is a position long advocated for by the European Parliament and it is an achievement of the European Parliament and I would like to thank Members of the European Parliament, who over the course of many years have fought for this. Why do we need to introduce own resources exactly now? Because we have indeed made the historic decision to launch the Recovery and Resilience Facility and the whole Next Generation EU package. And the introduction of own resources is the only way to pay for the Recovery and Resilience Facility without negatively affecting the EU budget in the future, because we do not want to see payments to farmers, payments to communes, to villages, to researchers, to Erasmus students, to be affected in the future. Neither do we want to see the security of our borders or our ambitions in the area of greening be affected. This is why we have to act now on own resources and this is why we, as the European Parliament, demand a binding calendar for the introduction of own resources, legally binding. And this should finance at least the repayment of interest and of the whole Next Generation EU over the course of the next years. We did our work. The ball is now in the field of the Council.

I think in these years we have given them endless reasons to get it going, but we haven't just moved forward yet.  In 2003, negotiating the current financial framework, we reached an agreement to launch this high-level group chaired by Mario Monti. We already have the study and we can't delay it anymore. It is a matter of fiscal justice, because it is not possible that it is the usual ones who keep public policies with their taxes, and that it is the usual ones who escape to contribute.  It is a matter of efficiency, because the establishment of certain taxes only makes sense at European level under the umbrella of the single market; it is a matter of climate policy, because those who pollute the most must pay more and must also contribute to the financing of the fair transition. And I would say that it is almost a matter of survival of the European project, because in this crisis, at last, a strong economic response has been given with that great agreement on the Recovery Plan at the July European Council.

The satisfaction is due to the fact that, thanks to this Decision, we are going to allow the European Union to borrow EUR 750 billion which will finance the joint fight against the economic consequences of the pandemic. But this satisfaction is coupled with a deep concern, which I share with the colleagues who have just spoke, and is that we do not have the resources to pay off the debt we are issuing. The European Union does not have the European resources to repay this European debt at the moment. Like the United States after the War of Independence, every seven years here, member states have to contribute unanimously and voluntarily to our request for money to continue to exist. That's not acceptable. This form of funding creates unacceptable tensions between Member States and it is time to change it. It is time for European debt to be paid with taxes, not with contributions from European citizens — from Dutch, French, etc. citizens — but with taxes that they pollute and do not pay and those who do not face the taxes they should face.

The European Commission ignores the fact that the average consumer will bear the consequences in terms of unemployment and inflation on prices. The border carbon tax will mean that Chinese or American multinationals will pass on their higher costs to their prices. Unchanged since 1988 in its operation, the own resources system had initially been the subject of a laudable reform which compensated for the benefit of the Member States the dumpings we suffer in ecological or fiscal matters. A discussion paper had been issued in 2017 in this direction, advocating the creation of new own resources, as the funding of the budget was mainly based on gross national income and therefore on the Member States. But under the cover of the economic crisis following the current pandemic, the Commission has succeeded in getting a mutualised loan repaid by self-sustaining revenues accepted, to be created, and which will turn into a sustainable tax for its own benefit. The picture of the Europeanisation of national public finances that the European Union has been preparing in petto for several years is now complete, with the creation of European taxes that do not say their names. But the fight is not over because, admittedly, Germany is reticent about the carbon tax and Ireland is reticent about the digital tax, unless the qualified majority replaces the rule of unanimity, yet engraved in the marble of the Brussels Treaties.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, we are in a particular moment, what is called momentum, - we have even heard of a Hamiltonian moment. It is true that today, with this report, it is a form of culmination of a long-running struggle that many and many MePs have long seen that not controlling our revenues is a democratic anomaly that needs to be repaired. It is during this crisis that we measure how essential it is that we are no longer dependent on the goodwill of the Council and the States in order to be in control of our revenues and therefore in control of our expenditure. This report says that it is time for Parliament and the European Union to have its own resources, but above all it says that it is time for us to have fair resources. Because today, in our various states, taxes are too often, precisely, on ordinary citizens. What is now being proposed to the Council is to finally have this fair taxation, one that attacks those who are now exempt from tax. It is the financial transaction tax, it is the GAFAM tax and it is also a tax at our borders, precisely to protect the companies in our territories who make the effort to be better known in social and environmental matters. My dear friends, if we are to be able to get out of this crisis, we must implement this fair taxation. The work of the co-speakers, both Mrs Hayer and Mr Fernandes, reflects parliament's will and I say this very quietly: there will be no blackmail. We will not accept that the Council will put us in front of the fait accompli, we want this fair taxation.

Firstly, it concerns the Council's decision to launch the procedure to create an opportunity to build a new Next Generation EU fund.  Secondly, what this entails is the question of building new own revenues in the future. This must be borne in mind, because this second debate obviously requires a different type of decision and agreement between Parliament and the Council, and the former actually takes time. It also takes time because, when we were working and discussing the 2021-2027 budget, when we had not yet talked about this fund at all, we were planning certain expenditures. Then the budget was sort of frozen or reduced and we were informed that it would be compensated with the help of the fund. At the moment, it appears that if ratification does not go according to plan, the fund could be seriously threatened.  I would therefore like to make it very clear that, since the Minister and the Commissioner are saying that we are talking about one package, which we agree with, then in this package everything must be interconnected and everything is dependent on each other, which means that Parliament's consent to the multiannual budget must be linked to creating an opportunity for a new fund.

The council's levy on unprocessed plastic has reached consensus only because it has been proposed at a relatively low level and a mechanism has been put in place to limit its regressivity. Thirdly, the Council rejected the introduction of an ETS-based own resource, as it is the revenue of national budgets from which the funds are allocated to actions related to the implementation of the Union's climate and energy policy.

In that sense, the Commission will continue to carry out its role and duty as an honest broker, and stands ready to offer all the necessary assistance.

Let me recall that the Multiannual Financial Framework and Next Generation EU legislation is a package. Only quick approval of all – and may I stress all – legal texts would allow the launching of the EU recovery plan.

We don't leave anyone behind! What do young people get from being unemployed now, but we may be taking on less debt in the next 20 years? We must make this decision now. In our decisions, we have placed the interests of the young generation in the focus of our decisions. Yes, raising taxes, introducing taxes is probably the most controversial thing in a democracy. We must justify this to the citizens. It takes majorities to do this. That is a little easier for you, but we need unanimity in the Council. We need the approval of all the Member States, of all the national parliaments, where ratification via national parliaments is necessary. Nor do we act anywhere in a vacuum, but we act on the basis of Article 311 of the EU Treaty. It lays down exactly what a reform of own resources should look like. This is by no means a coup or an attack on democracy, as certain circles, not only here in the European Parliament, but also in some national parliaments, are constantly trying to persuade the citizens, that is democracy. I do not know how we should make the bond of democracy in the European Union even stronger than to impose a special responsibility on the national parliaments – and not just on the European Parliament or the Commission or the Council.  However, it is not just a question of new levies and new revenue. Yes, that is important, honourable Members. But we also want to take forward the socio-ecological transformation of Europe. We want to do more for social justice, because if we really introduce the plastic tax, it will also have a steering effect. We want to help recycle even more plastic in the future.  Of course, there is also a consequence: then revenue may fall again. But that depends on how you, how we work together to design these taxes in detail. What these levies, these taxes, should look like exactly, what the roadmap that the Commission intends to present will also be at the heart of the negotiations between the three institutions, Parliament, the Council and the Commission. We press the Tube, we take our responsibilities seriously. I am pleased with the many, many signals of constructive support and that in the end there is a little argument about this, which should be self-evident in the importance of these issues.  Thank you very much for this important debate. I have learned a great deal, and we are taking this into the negotiations between the Council, the Commission and Parliament, and I look forward to a positive conclusion soon.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 89, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "José Manuel FERNANDES", "mepid": "96899", "text": "  Rapporteur. – All States are net beneficiaries of the European Union, even those who contribute the most and this pedagogy, this truth, should be told to all citizens of the European Union and the Council does not always do so and, usually, when there are those lengthy Councils, hide from their citizens that even those who are so-called \"net contributors\" receive much more than they put in the Budget of the European Union and it is to see , the benefits of the internal market.

The European Parliament has been calling for a change in the way the EU budget is financed for many years by reducing the contributions of The Member States, which are now the lion's share of the Union budget (around 70%). This would change the dynamics of budgetary negotiations, in which Member States' representatives attach less importance to the shape of Community policies and focus mainly on obtaining a favourable balance of their own commitments to the EU budget and the resources they receive from it. The EU's additional own resources, including the proceeds of the new taxes, should make it possible to repay loans taken out by the Commission.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Union's civil protection mechanism is a practical expression of solidarity. It supports states in need of high-risk emergencies: natural disasters, health crises and even possible biological, chemical or nuclear accidents. Until now, its action has focused on tackling forest fires. After all, rescEU was born as an idea after the deadly fires in Portugal in 2017. At the time, Europe seemed powerless to help one of its members. But also in the tragedy in Mati, in 2018, where over a hundred people died within minutes. Even the most sceptical at the time understood that we needed greater European intervention, both in terms of prevention and in terms of response. In 2020 we experienced a gigantic historical reversal, one that marks entire generations and changes attitudes and attitudes: the COVID-19 pandemic. Who expected that after a century of rapid scientific and technological development, history would not repeat itself as a farce but as a tragedy? Hundreds of thousands of people around the world, including over 140,000 fellow citizens, have killed us. The economic and social costs are still undetermined. We must therefore act proactively, even for the unforeseeable.  The changes we voted on a year and a half ago strengthened the mechanism, which became visible during the pandemic. His action saved our credibility when, at the beginning of the crisis, governments were making disappointingly unpleasant decisions. At that time we transported over 75,000 European citizens, who managed to return home from every corner of the world, thanks to the coordination and funding of the mechanism. In March, and while the pandemic was already spreading, rescEU created for the first time pan-European medical reserves, with protective equipment such as masks, essential machines such as respirators, and with the provision to integrate vaccines or treatments when available. Enough has been done, but we can certainly do a lot more together.  The pandemic has also highlighted weaknesses that we must immediately correct. Last February, President Michel proposed reducing the budget for the mechanism to EUR 1 billion for the period 2021-2027. But the events that followed showed how wrong his proposal was. For 2020 alone, the treaties forced the Commission to add an additional EUR 400 million to the mechanism.  Italy also first activated the mechanism, asking for help in early March. However, the material was delivered to her at the end of April, when the pandemic was already gradually receding. In 2017, following the fires in Portugal, President Juncker, effectively heralding the creation of the rescEU, called for a Europe that can effectively protect human life, not just send condolences to the families of the victims. Unfortunately, because of the Council's insistence at the time, the effort was incomplete. With the report we are debating today, the aim is to complete this work. We are substantially strengthening prevention by creating pan-European resilience targets for cross-border risks, linking them to national response plans. We are increasing funding to one hundred per cent for all instruments included in the rescEU, even for firefighting planes. We give the European Commission the right to buy instruments itself, when necessary, so that aid arrives on time, so that what happened in Italy, i.e. the two-month delay, does not happen again. Finally, we are tripling the budget of the mechanism for the next period, with an additional EUR 2 billion from the European Recovery Fund, exceeding a total of EUR 3 billion. We want the mechanism to be able to directly and effectively address not only a possible second wave of pandemic or forest fires, but also any other gray or black swan that occurs, threatening to change our lives in a dramatic and unexpected way.", "language": "en", "original_language": "el", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 4, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 97, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Johannes Hahn", "mepid": "n/a", "text": "   Member of the Commission. – Mr President, honourable Members, on behalf of my friend and colleague Janez Lenarčič, who can’t make it tonight, I am really pleased to discuss with you the report prepared by Mr Androulakis on the Commission’s proposal to amend the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. As Europe continues to struggle with the COVID—19 pandemic, we must recognise this as one of the worst health crises the continent has experienced in over 100 years. The statistics are harsh. Within the European Union alone, almost 4 million confirmed cases and over 210 000 deaths have been recorded to date. At the beginning of the crisis, unfortunately the response to requests for assistance was often too slow, or failed to materialise. The honourable Member of Parliament, Mr Androulakis, has already referred to this, and once again I have to say that the EU Member States were not in a position to provide assistance through the Union Civil Protection Mechanism from their own resources. 25 out of 52 requests to the Mechanism remained unanswered and 27 were answered only partially. The current system of civil protection relies on solidarity among Member States. This means that it depends largely on voluntary offers from Member States. This works very well in most types of emergencies. An example is the recent explosion in Lebanon, where more than a dozen Member States offered assistance through the Union Mechanism. But the limits of the current system were quickly reached during the early stages of the COVID—19 crisis, when virtually all EU Member States were affected at the same time. The European Council recognised these limitations in its joint statement of 26 March. It gave the Commission a clear task to propose a more ambitious Crisis Management System within the European Union. The voice of the European Parliament to strengthen the Union’s mechanism was equally strong, and the Commission has reacted. The revised proposal adopted in early June aims to strengthen European response capacities by expanding the scope of rescue, drawing lessons from the COVID—19 pandemic. It would make our system more flexible, faster and more comprehensive, and ultimately more effective in the case of large—scale complex emergencies. The Commission welcomes the report by the Committee on the Environment, which recognises the impact of strengthening the Mechanism’s response capability through direct procurement of specific items by the European Commission, so that we can better support the Member States in case of need. Second, strengthening the European Response Coordination Centre, serving as a hub for the national civil protection centres to help strengthen our coordination, and thirdly putting a strong focus on prevention and preparedness, including through the establishment of Union—wide resilience goals. These are key aspects of our proposal. We also have the opportunity now to put in place an ambitious budget to support this enhanced EU Civil Protection Mechanism. As you know, the Commission has proposed to allocate EUR 3.1 billion for Civil Protection over the next seven years. The COVID—19 pandemic has shown that nature rolls the dice. This is our wake—up call. The next large scale emergency will strike again. it is only a matter of time. The way we choose to act now will determine how prepared we will be in the future.

This will also contribute to visibility.  And that is my second point: it must never happen again that foreign powers are visible in a crisis and the European Union is not.

Extreme temperatures, forest fires, floods, storms, earthquakes and even diseases are part of our reality and we always need to be able to respond effectively. Taught by the experience of the coronavirus pandemic, I believe that we need to strengthen the three pillars of the Civil Protection Mechanism: prevention, preparedness and response.

Croatia was also among the first countries to receive protective equipment through rescEU during the first wave of the pandemic.

I welcome the announced significant increase in funding for the Civil Protection Mechanism as this ensures the strengthening of the Union’s capacity and action in the field of health and civil protection.

I welcome today’s discussion and the report of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) on the changes to the Union Civil Protection Mechanism. It goes without saying that these changes are timely and very necessary. Both the text of the report and the almost unanimous support of the members of the ENVI Committee show that Parliament univocally supports enhanced cooperation between the States as well as the strengthening of the Union Mechanism. In my first discussion in the European Parliament last September, I spoke about the importance of mechanisms such as the Crisis Management Coordination Centre and the European capacity reserve of the rescEU for crisis response. Such disasters and crises cannot be resolved without cooperation and relying solely on national capacities. Member States, especially smaller ones, cannot afford to maintain high preparedness and large reserves in times of crises. In many Member States, including Slovenia, protection against natural and other disasters is still strongly dependent on volunteers. Solidarity and volunteering are values that I, as a social democrat and human being, strongly support. I honestly thank and extend my gratitude to everyone who selflessly helps fellow people and the communities. But volunteers cannot, and must not, bear the burden of major global crises. One of the biggest disappointments in this crisis is still the uncoordinated – sometimes also very selfish – behaviour of the Member States. In this chaos, the European Commission, within its competences, has quickly responded in the framework of the crisis and civil protection mechanisms in the EU and worldwide. So, even greater coordination, together with increased jurisdiction in the fields of health, crisis response mechanisms and civil protection, joint acquisition and maintenance of a commitment and vaccine reserves are essential for preserving the lives and health of the people.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 1, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 102, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Nicolae ŞTEFĂNUȚĂ", "mepid": "58766", "text": "  on behalf of the Renew Group. – Mr President, in the age of climate change, we must prepare now, in 2020, for the world of 2030, a world that doesn’t look simple at all. ‘Protection is not a principle, but an expedient’.

I have seen this time and again in my various responsibilities as Commissioner over the last ten years. Now we are faced with a disaster that affects virtually all Member States, and therefore their ability to help others is limited.  We have seen on a modest scale how the situation has simply improved in some countries, for example by transferring patients who needed intensive treatment to other countries where different beds were still available. But this was all very limited, and we also known to have had problems deploying a certain number of devices. All this is to be addressed and eliminated appropriately by this new mechanism.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to present to you today my report on maritime emissions. Maritime transport is so far the only sector in which the 'polluter pays' principle does not apply. There is no priceing of greenhouse gases or emission reduction targets. Shipping is not explicitly mentioned in either the Kyoto Protocol or the Paris climate agreement, although emissions from the sector are expected to increase by fifty percent compared to 2018 to 2050. Maritime transport already emits 138 megatonnes of CO2 a year from European Union ports. That is 3.7% of climate-related emissions in the EU. That is as much as is being ejected throughout Belgium. We know this very well because the EU adopted the MRV Regulation in 2015; since 2018, all ships over 5000 gross registered tonnes – no matter who they own, under which flag they fly, for whom they are sailing – have to report their CO2 emissions when using EU ports. These reports are verified, reported, the public has transparent access to them. After the EU adopted this regulation, the international shipping organisation, the IMO, finally moved and set up its own system. Last year, the Commission put forward a proposal to bring the reporting systems into line, but unfortunately it has missed the opportunity to move from counting to reducing emissions. And we can still do so much statistics, so we don't save a single gram of CO2.  This House declared a climate emergency in November last year. We must live up to our responsibility for the planet and for future generations.  That is why we are proposing two essential additions to the Commission's proposal: firstly, maritime transport will be included in the ETS emissions trading scheme by January 2022. This will be the first time that an incentive has been created to reduce the CO2 emissions of ships. There is already a comprehensive impact assessment for this, and it shows that this would reduce emissions from the sector by more than twenty per cent.  Madam President von der Leyen and Vice-President Timmermans have repeatedly promised, as part of the Green Deal, that shipping will be included in the ETS. We are now presenting a proposal here that will not only generate own resources for the EU budget – and Mr Hahn should be particularly pleased about this – but will also create a fund for research and development of climate-friendly vessels and the financing of marine protected areas.  Secondly, we want ships to be forty per cent more efficient on average by 2030 compared to 2018/2019 – for which we have very valid data. In this way, this sector can play its part in helping to increase the climate targets by 2030, which we are currently negotiating in the Climate Act. If the volume of transport remains the same, this measure alone would fill ten per cent of the gap we have if we increase the climate targets by 2030.  We also want a few things, such as the extension of the coverage of greenhouse gas emissions to the extremely climate-damaging methane, which is increasingly being used in LNG vessels and where studies are already taking place showing that emissions of methane have increased massively from maritime transport. We call on the Commission to take measures to ensure that we have zero emissions in ports. This is about protecting the health of our citizens, who can no longer be expected to be polluted.  Honourable Members, new reports are coming every day about the effects of climate change: East Africa is sinking into rains, the west coast of the USA is burning, the Alpine glaciers are dwindling. I believe that we must shoulder our responsibilities and reduce emissions as quickly as possible in all areas.

The EU system to monitor, report and verify these emissions is an important step to integrating emissions into EU climate policy; but it is just a first step, because we aim to come up with plans to reduce overall emissions in the maritime sector. The key goal of our reporting system is to collect robust and verified CO2 emissions data, to make those data publicly available, to stimulate the uptake of energy-efficient technologies and behaviours, and to inform our policymaking.  Since the entry into force of the data collection system of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) in 2019, all large ships calling at ports in the European Economic Area have to report their full consumption and other information under two systems: the European and the international one. In accordance with the Monitoring, Reporting and Verification (MRV) Regulation, the European Commission has now proposed to align, where appropriate, the EU MRV system with the IMO data collection system. The aim is to preserve the objectives of the current MRV Regulation by keeping its governance and ambition, while including technical adjustments to align the two regimes, simplifying compliance. The Commission proposal does not affect the main thrust of the European system, which is to maintain the robustness and transparency of our rules. The report of the Environment Committee before you has received the Commission’s full attention. As you know, some proposed amendments go significantly beyond the Commission’s proposal to align the European global data collection systems, namely the amendment to extend the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) to maritime transport and the amendment for large shipping companies to reduce their annual average CO2 emissions by at least 40% by 2030. While the European Commission fully agrees with the European Parliament that the shipping sector needs to duly contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement and must achieve the Union-wide climate neutrality objective, we don’t consider the review of the EU reporting rules to be the appropriate vehicle to include shipping in the ETS or to introduce operational component density requirements. There is also no impact assessment for these two elements. There is a difference of opinion on the instrument, but our political goals are shared. As you know, the Commission has already announced, as part of the European Green Deal, its intention to extend the ETS to maritime emissions, and the impact assessment is being prepared. Work on this is in full swing and the Commission will come forward with the relevant legislative proposals to reduce the climate impact of shipping activities.  Let me stress, the Commission will duly take into account the elements proposed by this Parliament when developing its initiatives under the European Green Deal. For these reasons – and as we are still awaiting the Council’s position on these elements – the Commission has to reserve its position on the amendments concerning the extension of the Emissions Trading System and the carbon density requirements for ships. Of course, the same applies to other amendments that were not in the original Commission proposal. The Commission looks forward to continuing discussions on other important aspects of its proposal. These include possible improvements to the scope of the regulation in terms of ship size, rules when there is a change of company, the reporting of cargo carried, and the review clause within the remit of the reporting system. Let me assure you that the Commission remains committed to reducing emissions in the maritime sector. Let me also assure you that the upcoming 2030 Climate Target Plan will show not only this commitment but also the ambition to get it done. We will work hand in hand with this Parliament on our pathway to climate neutrality in shipping and beyond.

And what is now being proposed could actually result in a reduction of at least 40% by 2030.  Perhaps we could even have reached the higher level, but where we are now, we are already where we have taken some long strong nautical miles, respecting the fact that shipping is an international industry in which the European Union does not decide everything, but has an important role in dragging the entire planet's shipping into the right course for the climate of all of us.  The EU thus has an important first mover role for the planet's green transition. But the first movers, indeed it is also the companies in the EU shipping industry, which have been making great efforts for several years to decarbonise their activities. They have done so with the effective use of the MRV regulation's CO2 reporting system, which now needs to be revised to make it an even better tool.  That is why the EPP – and I above all – is pleased that we in the European Parliament this week are hopefully coming up with a good negotiating mandate for the forthcoming trialogue between us and the Council, a mandate that combines high ambitions with respect for those who draw the heaviest load. First movers in all the EU industries, which are also at the centre of the green transition, they are watching from the sidelines and must, of course, see that the European Parliament both recognises and continues to support that it always pays to do its best.  What we are not happy with – and therefore do not support in the EPP – is to use the specific case, a revision of the MRV regulation, to throw the entire EU transit into the CO2 quota system, the ETS, without a proper impact assessment and without an independent and thoroughly drafted legislative proposal. It is simply sloppy haste, which is neither good legislative practice nor serves the purpose that the EU really has the opportunity to emerge as the planet's carbon-reducing beacon.

Everyone needs to contribute in that transition and today the shipping sector is not part of it. They sail away and do their own thing. It’s not acceptable. We need to make sure that everyone is part of this transition if we are to deliver what it is our right to do, as politicians. We know that the shipping sector also has a very negative impact on the climate and it risks to have even more so in the future. It’s extremely worrying that it, in fact, has proceeded to raise its contribution to emissions between 50 or 250% to 2050, when we are supposed to be climate neutral. We in the Group of the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats (S&amp;D) refuse to stand passive and therefore we are very happy that in this monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) system is a good piece of legislation for reporting emissions, but now we finally have an Emissions Trading System (ETS) proposed on the table and we believe this will be very important to take this sector under its, rightly, demand to contribute. We also demand that every ship will reduce its emissions by at least 40% by the year 2030.

Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, behind this technical subject the collection of data on CO2 emissions from maritime transport is in fact a major issue of the Green Pact for Europe, but also of the European recovery plan. Major in particular on two subjects. The first is the decarbonisation of the sector. For several years, the International Maritime Organization has been engaged in the ecological and energy transition of maritime transport, but at an insufficient pace in relation to the issues and in particular the expected increase, as has been said, of emissions of 50 to 250% by 2050. It is all the more important to send a strong signal to the Commission and, beyond that, to the International Maritime Organization. Indeed, in this first world market, which represents Europe, 90% of goods pass through the sea. I can attest to this: when you sail, especially in the English Channel, the procession of cargo ships is impressive! I welcome the fact that the text sets numerical emission reduction targets (40% by 2030) and I call on the Commission to set a reference year that takes into account the data collected, i.e. 2018. I also urge him not to forget the maritime sector in the recovery plan. Pan-European projects are emerging and will give a competitive advantage over the construction of green vessels. The second major issue is the inclusion of shipping in the carbon market. Major, because the fruit of this enlarged market will feed the own resources, essential to the European recovery plan. It is also important because the Ocean Fund we are proposing to create will not only support the decarbonisation of the sector, but also finance the restoration of marine and coastal ecosystems, which contribute massively to the absorption of carbon.

Market-based solutions for the climate crisis, such as ETS, have generally failed. However, in this instance we are proposing to frame shipping’s inclusion in the ETS with a binding regulatory target of 40% emission reductions per transport work by 2030. The rapporteur’s report is mainly concerned with emissions efficiency. Shipping emissions are directly related to global trade and consumption. Therefore, in order to reduce absolute greenhouse gas emissions from maritime transport, in addition to emissions per transport work, the EU must promote and pursue a global de-growth strategy rather than the new growth strategy proposed in the European Green Deal. In Amendment 71, I also propose to delete the exemption for warships. Militaries are massive polluters.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioner, I would like to thank the rapporteur for her excellent work and for the work she has Thank you for the very detailed and very lively debate. I would just like to comment briefly on a few things, because it may not have reached everywhere. Just as the MRV regulation already applies to all ships entering EU ports, no matter what flag they fly under, no matter who they belong to, no matter who they are sailing for, our proposals to extend this regulation now are, of course, coined to the entire scope, to the full scope of the MRV. In other words, there are no disadvantages for EU shipping companies or shipping companies or charterers, but it affects everyone equally. Those who do not want to enter the EU because they no longer want to sell goods here are, of course, free to do so. But I don't think that's going to happen anytime soon. I would like to clarify one more thing, because this is always confused. With the efficiency target, we are talking about the fact that by 2030, fleet emissions must be 40% below the fleet average – the average fleet today. In other words, the first movers, who have already done something, whose ships are already much more efficient, have only a much smaller way to go. In other words, their efforts are automatically rewarded because, of course, they have already made their investment, while everyone else has it ahead of them. This means that they already have a competitive advantage, because of course they also consume much less fuel.  As far as openness to technology is concerned, I would also like to say this briefly: if you do not want to make an investment, you can simply slow down. If you reduce the speed by 20%, you can save 40% of fuel. This means that you can also achieve this efficiency goal simply by driving slowly. My final point is that I've been on a lot of panels now. There are many possibilities, whether methanol, whether ammonia, they are actually just waiting for them to get a signal that the maritime sector will be held to account, because then such investments will also be worthwhile.", "language": "en", "original_language": "de", "translation_provider": "azure", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 124, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Ewa KOPACZ", "mepid": "197525", "text": "  I close the debate.

At the same time, it is a necessary contribution by the maritime sector to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the European economy, which aims to achieve full climate neutrality for Europe by 2050. However, it should be borne in mind that, in order for these solutions to be implemented, a comprehensive assessment of the impact of the proposed regulations on issues such as the competitiveness of European maritime transport or employment in the maritime sector is needed.  Equally important is the availability of advanced technologies to effectively reduce emissions.

And that is why it’s so important that once a year we discuss EU arms exports in this Parliament, and that’s also why it’s so important that we use this report to improve our way to control where arms end up in this world. And that’s why I decided to use my report to focus on two things: on transparency and on convergence. In our report we all together reached quite a lot. For example, we are calling on the European External Action Service to actually translate these 500 pages of numbers and columns into an online-searchable database so that public oversight is actually possible. We also ask the European External Action Service to build up a joint EU-level end-user control, rather than forcing 27 Member States to do like a semi-functional system, and we have a number of other suggestions on which we reached broad consensus in our negotiations. And I think we can be very proud, because they help us to better scrutinise and regulate EU arms exports. But as proud as we all can be, this doesn’t solve the main problem, and the main problem is that we have one common position on arms export of the EU, but we have 27 national interpretations, 27 export systems, and an increasing divergence in actual exports of Member States. And the more we work together in arms production, the more this will be a problem ˗ the more this will be a problem for democratic control and oversight, because if Member States produce arms together, who actually decides over the exports? Is it the Member State that puts in the most parts? Is it the Member State that puts in the last screw? Can one block all? Do you need to vouch your rights for democratic control before you can join? This is not very clear. And the conflict between France and Germany last year over arms exports to Saudi Arabia clearly showed how easily this can create tensions. But this divergence is also a problem for a common EU foreign and security policy. We were also happy about the good results of the Berlin Conference earlier this year. We even set up an EU mission in the Mediterranean to enforce the arms embargo against Libya, and this very same mission reported a violation of the arms embargo by Turkey and the UAE, yet EU Member States still supply Turkey, the UAE and all the other countries breaking this arms embargo with weapons, and some of these weapons end up with Sarraj, others end up with Haftar, all fuelling the violence. And Mr Borrell, I really wouldn’t want to be in your shoes trying to build a consistent EU foreign policy on that mess. And then, my dear colleagues from EPP, there’s the arms industry: the arms industry that already today complains that all these national regulations make cooperation super difficult, that arms export decisions are not reliable and that they cannot do business that way. And to be frank, I totally get their point. And dear colleagues, all these examples clearly show that if we want to do joint arms production, we need to do joint arms export control as one EU. What I really don’t understand is why the Commission, the Member States and parts of this Parliament are pushing so much for an internal defence market for joint arms production ˗ even putting money into it ˗ and at the same time, the very same people refuse to even discuss an EU-level involvement in democratic oversight and export control and thereby undermine what they want to reach: a European defence union and strategic autonomy of the European Union. I want to thank all my shadows for the very fierce and fair debates we had in the negotiations. We’ve reached a lot, but on this point we didn’t reach consensus, and that’s why I decided to bring it to the parliamentary debate today.

I think it includes many useful suggestions that will help me to deal with a difficult subject like this in a more convergent, transparent and responsible way.  You are right that decisions on arms exports receive great attention and are politically sensitive because indeed trade in arms may potentially carry the risk of serious breaches for human rights, humanitarian law and regional stability, and most of the time the three things together. A strict implementation by Member States of the agreed common positions on arms exports is therefore essential to uphold the European Union’s values and its strategic objective. As you state in your report, this is also crucial for our credibility as a geopolitical player. A high level of convergence with regard to its full application will indeed more effectively ensure respect for human rights and international law by all parties involved. I think we can say that we, the European Union, are moving fast in the field of defence. The European Defence Fund and the European Peace Facility will serve to strengthen internal collaboration on defence matters to make the European Union a more capable security provider at the global level. Our defence industries will become ever more closely intertwined. They will strengthen our strategic autonomy and the protection of our citizens, fostering innovation and saving cost. All that is right, but, at the same time, in this context, further convergence of arms export policies becomes still more important.  As mentioned in your motion for a resolution, maintaining a vibrant and innovative defence industry in the European Union is a key component of our strategic autonomy and our European defence. It serves to ensure our capabilities and reduce dependency, while the defence industry is also a major source of technological innovation. I will give you some examples. In 2018, it generated more than EUR 100 billion in revenue and supported more than 400 000 jobs in Europe – 400 000 jobs! To ensure a thriving defence industry, exports are essential, but of course the defence industry is different from other industrial sectors and deserves special consideration, taking into account its obvious links to national and international security, human rights and humanitarian values. That’s why the European Union Member States have also exported control rules in place for military equipment since 2008. Under the common position on arms export, Member States assess arms export license applications against a number of criteria established to ensure our strategic interests and also our values. A review of this text was finalised last year. The Council agreed that the common position will serve this purpose but introduce some changes to bring the text into line with the adopted Arms Trade Treaty and other recent developments. In your own statement on the common position on arms export control, you stress three key objectives: the need for increased control, convergency and transparency. First, your support for an increase control. Let me start by saying that I am grateful the report welcomes operations within these objectives to implement a United Nations arms embargo on Libya. This is a concrete example of what the European Union does to prevent arms ending up in the wrong hands. Further, as a global actor, the EU supports outreach activities to assist countries in the European neighbourhood and beyond in setting up arms export control mechanisms and implementing the Arms Trade Treaty.  Second, on transparency, European Union Member States are already among the most transparent countries, including in arms exports. Still, in order to increase the possibility to further scrutinise accountability, I am glad to say that this year the European External Action Service will launch a public, searchable database on its website to allow all stakeholders to consult and analyse Member States’ arms exports in a user-friendly way. So everybody will be able to know what the Member States’ arms exports are about – everybody will be able to find out whatever data they want to know about it.   Third, and lastly, increased convergence. Member States are holding regular exchanges to share information on policies, denial of licences and possible measures. As a concrete result, a new initiative has been launched and the working party on arms exports is currently preparing a Council decision to set rules on end-user certificates for the export of small arms and light weapons and their ammunition.  Let me conclude by anticipating that the next annual European Union arms export report on 2019 will become available shortly, probably in October, two months earlier than in previous years, and it will bring a lot of precious information about these developments. I would like to thank you for your attention. I am looking forward to hearing your points or views.

Madam President, thank you to the rapporteur and to all the colleagues who have been involved in this difficult text. Difficult, because this subject mixes industrial, legal and moral considerations, it was well understood in the introductory presentation, on a sensitive subject. And it is also difficult because it must be admitted that this Parliament has no prerogatives on the subject. I understand that this is distressing many colleagues who would like to be able to take control of arms exports, but it is not, it is a national prerogative. Where I disagree with what was said in the introduction to this debate is that just because this European Parliament does not have control over a subject does not mean that there is no such thing as democratic control. Democratic control exists in our national parliaments on this very specific subject of arms export controls. This is one of the strong enough reservations that my group has about this report, namely that these national prerogatives should not lead to systematic suspicion on the part of our Parliament. The other point of reservation concerns a point addressed by the rapporteur, which is the production of armaments at European level. However, ladies and gentlemen, the European Union as such does not produce armaments and the instruments you are talking about, the European Defence Fund for example, are still virtual instruments. I would remind you that this fund does not have a budget at this time, nor the same regulation of application, and that when it comes into force, it is likely to be $1 billion a year. Everyone knows that weapons programs are much broader than that. So we'll talk about it in due course. When these Genuinely European, European weapons programmes are in place, we may be able to talk about the modalities of control. For now, it's virtual. So I understand the impatience of some colleagues to make this chamber play a more active role, but we are not there yet.

But increased arms cooperation, whether within the EU or between individual Member States, also requires European arms export control, especially in view of the fact that the EU states together are the second largest arms exporter in the world behind the US. After all, strict arms export control is undoubtedly linked to greater European cooperation and can no longer be regarded merely as a national matter.  As early as 2008, the EU adopted criteria to be examined and respected by Member States in the case of arms exports. However, the criteria are still not always respected. This is true even with arms exports to countries participating in the wars in Yemen and Libya.  Arms exports sometimes allow for or prolong military conflicts. They often make it possible to break international law. In other words, it is not enough just to express noble intentions and to call on Member States without consequences to act in accordance with the common criteria. We also need a sanction mechanism in case individual Member States ignore the agreed common criteria, because European cooperation also requires European enforcement.  And another thing that has just been added: we need an immediate halt to all arms exports to Turkey. Turkey is threatening us with war. It would be absurd if we also supply Turkey with the weapons to kill EU citizens.

This report is a political compromise that reflects the complex nature of the topic. It spans from the basic right of every state to self-defence, enshrined in the UN Charter, to the eternal aspiration of human kind for universal peace and security. Arms export and related technologies are inevitably subject to fierce ideological discussion.  The report reflects the steps forward made by Member States towards respecting the EU Common Position on arms export, and more and more Member States are following the Common Position and its eight criteria on arms export and related technologies. Although greater progress is needed, it is important to recognise all efforts made in this report. And we must bear in mind that arms export is still a Member State competence, which is why the progress made in respecting the Common Position is even more important. The future development of the Union and of the international environment will require greater convergence among Member States on arms export. A growing number of joint development programmes in the field of defence production will expose the need for a common approach to arms export among Member States as well as at EU-level. Defence production is destined to become more European and arms export control mechanisms will need to reflect this new reality. This new reality, in turn, will need to be reflected in EU legislation as well.  But despite great ambitions, we are not yet at that point. This is why we are not in favour of an ad hoc sanction mechanism in this field and prefer a future European solution instead. This can be achieved through a gradual approach, in parallel with the development and strengthening of the common security and defence policy. Regardless of all differences, the report reiterates that the Common Position and its necessary mechanisms must ensure that exported arms and related technologies are not used in a wrong way and above all, are not in the possession of the wrong actors.

I heard some interesting points for sure. Let me summarise some of your points. First, criticism on exports from Member States to sensitive destinations. Yemen, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have been mentioned, but as one of the members that participated in the debate rightly remembered, decisions when issuing export licences are taken at the national level. So there is very little we can do from the European Commission. This is something that is taken at the national level, but we can call for more conversions in arms export policies as the Member States implement it. And on that, I agree completely. Here we are together, because we think that we can behave together in accordance with general rules which reflect our values. So it’s a Member State competence, but we need more convergence on the way each Member State implements these competences. There are also calls for arms embargoes for specific destinations. I could also agree, but an arms embargo to a specific destination requires unanimity in the Council. You should be aware of that, and you know how difficult it is to get unanimity today. But for sure, we can try to agree an arms embargo, but then you have to implement them and experience shows how difficult it is to do so, as we tried to do with the Irini operation in Libya. First unanimity, and second the willingness to really implement the decision. Military weapons have an indispensable role in the preservation of security, freedom and peace, provided that they are used in accordance with international law, human rights law and international humanitarian law. You cannot pretend to have security, and to protect freedom and peace, without having military resources. But you have to use them according to the law, and weapons of war are, by definition, capable of inflicting death and destruction. This ambivalence means that governments that export the weapons must ensure that they are traded and used in a responsible and accountable way, and prevent their diversion to terrorists, criminals and other unauthorised users. This must remain our ambition: to control the use of these weapons in order that they are not being misused. But by definition weapons inflict death and destruction, and our role is to try to be sure that they are used in accordance with the rules of war, and with the rules that protect human rights. Accountability for arms export decisions can only take place when authorities are transparent, and the European Union does all it can to ensure that utmost transparency is being upheld. This enables national parliaments, civil society and also the European Parliament to hold informed debate, and the Council and the Parliament clearly agree that the strengthening of the European defence technologies and industrial base should be accompanied by closer cooperation and conversions in the control of exports of military technology and equipment.  I will continue working in the process of increased convergence, and promoting more transparency in arms exports in the framework of the competences of the Commission and of the High Representative.

So allow me to give you his statement. As we are discussing a report focusing on the implementation of the Association Agreement between the EU and Georgia, I would like to recall that the Association Agreement is a comprehensive framework that covers a wide range of policy areas from political dialogue, rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, all the way to economic and trade relations. The report points out that enhanced cooperation and EU assistance to Georgia are based on the more-for-more principle and are conditional on continued reform processes across all policy areas. Georgia has undertaken ambitious reforms and achieved a lot. It deserves to be underscored that Georgia’s European aspirations enjoy broad support among almost all the political parties as well as among the Georgian people. The report also recalls that the EU-Georgia Association Agreement and ECFTA aims to gradually integrate the country with the EU single market and calls on the Commission to be more vocal in promoting and advancing this goal. Political life in Georgia, as we all know, is lively and dynamic. A worrying trend is the increased polarisation of the political scene. This report underscores the need to de-escalate the political discourse and continue reforms in order to guarantee media freedom and independence of the judiciary. Recently, Georgia has experienced a period of tensions between the government and the political opposition over changes to the electoral system. At the end of June the Georgian parliament passed a constitutional amendment that is designed to provide for more proportional representation and, hopefully, for more pluralistic political discourse after the parliamentary elections in 2020. With those elections approaching, the report emphasises the need to uphold and protect media freedom and guarantee equal access to the media for all political parties during this important election campaign. The elections will take place on 31 October, and I believe that if the COVID-19 situation allows for it, the European Parliament should also dispatch an election observation mission to Georgia. The report commends Georgia’s internationally-acclaimed response to the COVID-19 outbreak, and I would also like to highlight the exemplary cooperation between the EU and Georgia in responding to this crisis. And while assessing the progress Georgia has made, we cannot forget that one fifth of the territory of the country continues to be occupied. Hundreds of thousands of people are unable to return to their homes or face restrictions to their fundamental rights and freedom. And in addition, Georgia continues to be a target of Russian hybrid activities. The report strongly condemns the ongoing provocations and the borderisation activities that continue along the administrative boundary line. Finally, the report received the almost unanimous support of the Foreign Affairs Committee in this House, and the rapporteur, Sven Mikser, would like to thank all the political parties and the Groups who expressed their support to the legitimate aspirations of the Georgian people as well as to the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Georgia.", "language": "en", "original_language": "en", "translation_provider": "none", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 0, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 145, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Josep BORRELL FONTELLES", "mepid": "28267", "text": "   Vice-President of the Commission / High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy. – Madam President, as you know very well, Georgia is a very close partner in our neighbourhood and subscribes to an ambitious Association Agreement with a deep and comprehensive free-trade area underpinned by common values, shared ownership and responsibility. Our relations have been maturing from the human rights agenda to connectivity, security, cooperation and academic exchanges under Erasmus+. Our norms on standards are gradually aligning, making real improvements in the lives of Georgian citizens.  We are looking forward to continuing to cooperate with Georgia, to agree joint priorities in an Association Agenda for post-2020, strengthening our cooperation, for instance to fight abuses in the visa-free regime, and I am also confident that our Eastern Partnership in March 2020 will devise a compelling vision for our multilateral relations. Our solidarity to support Georgia in mitigating the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19 is steadfast. I think more than EUR 180 million in bilateral funds and EUR 150 million in macro-financial assistance remains conditional on progress made. Let me have a look at the domestic challenges and opportunities of this country, and let me make reference to three important issues: the electoral context; the justice reform; and the conflicts. This is a crucial month ahead of the October parliamentary elections in Georgia. In March, the political parties reached a historic agreement, co-facilitated by the European Union delegation. It created a new electoral system more conducive to inclusive gradual and transparent elections. And now we expect effective implementation of these laws and respect for the highest democratic standards. In the justice sector it is important for the Georgian parliament to revisit the selection procedure for Supreme Court judges, which undermines a transparent, genuine, merit-based nomination process, as you mentioned in the report. It is critical to uphold the highest standards of ethics and integrity in the judiciary.  Finally, let me also reaffirm our unwavering commitment to Georgia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognised borders. I agree with you that the continuing borderisation is completely unacceptable, since we have seen a deterioration of security along the administrative boundary line with the breakaway region of South Ossetia, such as in the Chorchana-Tsnelisi area. I am also very concerned about the continuous closure of crossing points, complicating medical treatment, contacts and access to livelihood. We are constantly reiterating our concerns to Russia in bilateral and multilateral fora and we will continue doing so on behalf of the stability of Georgia that deserves peaceful borders with all its neighbours.

This is a milestone in the normalization of Georgia's domestic political environment, which we are all looking forward to, and we hope to see fair and fair elections.

I welcome the recent electoral reform in line with the recommendations of the Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) and hope that it will contribute to ease the polarisation in Georgia’s political and media landscape. I would also like to recognise the promotion of women’s representation. I urge all political parties, especially and including the opposition, to do their utmost to guarantee peaceful, fair and free elections on 21 October. These elections will be crucial in determining Georgia’s future for years to come.  Georgia has an impressive reform record. Of course, further approximation is still needed in some areas like environmental protection and the fight against discrimination of vulnerable groups. It is also true that Georgia is a young democracy where the rule of law must be further consolidated.

The agreement reached by the political parties earlier this year on electoral reforms is the right step and must be fully implemented in order to be able to move forward and to overcome the political polarisation that has long been hampering progress in Georgia. The Georgian authorities should refrain from pursuing any politically motivated judicial cases and harassing opposition politicians. It is also imperative to guarantee media freedom, editorial independence and to take steps to prevent disinformation campaigns. Also, the people must be guaranteed freedom of thought and assembly. There are still many areas that need to be improved, like consolidating the rule of law, the fight against corruption and strengthening human rights and fundamental freedoms.

We welcome Georgia's return to the path of reform which has made it, as some of the honourable Members have said, one of the countries in the area that is most close to European standards, after overcoming a double crisis, which has been overcome by dialogue and negotiation and, at this point, I also recognise the work of the European External Action Service and Ambassador Hartzell to manage this agreement with the opposition.  We regret that the opposition did not support constitutional reform and electoral reform in Parliament, despite its commitments and despite the pardons that took place, which were one of its requests. We were very demanding with the Government and very demanding with the majority party and believe that the opposition should have supported these reforms, that they were the continuation of the political agreement to which the European Union contributed and which, moreover, benefit, by losing the majority bias, those minor parties in the system.  In any case, with this new framework the elections move forward. And the concern now, Mr Borrell, is how we are going to observe an election in a pandemic situation, with difficulties on the part of Parliament and with difficulty in articulating a mission of the usual ones. I just heard that the OSCE is sending a normal electoral mission. I believe that the European Union, the European External Action Service and Parliament must do the same and we must in any case support domestic observation, because there are large NGOs working very professionally in that country. Because it is necessary to reassure the period immediately after the election, in a climate as polarized as it is traditional in Georgia and, for that, an international observation has always been essential. So that Georgia can continue on that path that we have all praised, in the direction of European values.", "language": "en", "original_language": "es", "translation_provider": "azure", "politicalGroup": "S&D", "keywordAnalysis": {"health": {"malaria": 0, "diarrhoea": 0, "infection": 0, "disease": 0, "sars": 0, "measles": 0, "pneumonia": 0, "epidemic": 0, "pandemic": 1, "public health": 0, "healthcare": 0, "epidemiology": 0, "health care": 0, "health": 0, "mortality": 0, "morbidity": 0, "nutrition": 0, "illness": 0, "infectious": 0, "NCD": 0, "non-communicable disease": 0, "noncommunicable disease": 0, "communicable disease": 0, "air pollution": 0, "malnutrition": 0, "mental disorder": 0, "stunting": 0}, "climate": {"climate change": 0, "global warming": 0, "green house": 0, "temperature": 0, "extreme weather": 0, "global environmental change": 0, "climate variability": 0, "greenhouse": 0, "low carbon": 0, "ghge": 0, "renewable energy": 0, "carbon emission": 0, "co2 emission": 0, "climate pollutant": 0}}}, {"id": 154, "date": "2020-09-14.json", "name": "Helmut GEUKING", "mepid": "197436", "text": "   Madam President, I would like to thank the president for her Last year, I was able to travel to Georgia with the delegation. I was amazed at how quickly the state reacted: I got the list handed over with the 85 detainees, within 24 hours that was settled – 81 were free, and four were indicted, but also rightly indicted for attempting to overthrow by force of arms. So Georgia, I mean, was very flexible.  We had mentioned the right to vote. It should be changed in 2024. It was amended, as we all know, in March. So these are all signs that Georgia desperately wants to go to Europe, and rather yesterday than today. In other words, it is in our hands that we bring Georgia into our House of Europe as soon as possible. Because we are all aware of the situation with Russia, we see it in Crimea, with Ukraine, with Russia, in part, and we know about the occupied territories also in Georgia. Europe now has a duty here. We should now bring Georgia to Europe as soon as possible and really make it a full member. Georgia is ready. That is why it is up to us to take action here after the elections in October and to say that Georgia will become a full member of the European Union.

I have also been in Georgia in difficult times, much more difficult than now. The country is demonstrating democratic strength and economic development, and I think that we have to welcome that this Parliament will be stepping up its cooperation with the Georgian Parliament after the next elections and will also not shy away from reminding Georgia of the need to deliver on the full reform agenda. The problems at their borders should not be an excuse for not solving the problems in the interior of the country that only the Georgian people can solve. The European Union, through our Association Agreement, will continue supporting Georgia in this endeavour.

This debate clearly demonstrates that Georgia has made substantial progress on its European path. This Parliament acknowledges the reforms on the part of the Georgian Government which strengthen democracy, the rule of law, human rights and fundamental freedoms, and of course, we also know work is still to be done.  Let me just highlight two items that require Georgia’s continued commitment. First and absolutely core in the implementation of the Association Agreement is the need for the Georgian Government to consolidate the rule of law and to continue its pursuit of justice reform. Second, and crucial to Georgia’s adherence to the terms in the Association Agreement, is guaranteeing media freedom. We all know that Georgia’s media landscape is highly politicised and as we are here speaking on Georgia ahead of the national elections, we also know the great responsibility that lies on the shoulders of all the political parties in Georgia to ensure a free and fair election.  Let me conclude with some positive words, with some words of support. Georgia is a country close to my heart. Some of my best friends live in that country and the country has come a long way in its aspirations for democracy, freedom and prosperity, and that in a very difficult geopolitical environment. The EU must recognise this and continue to be a key motivator for reforms to continue. I think we all agree that the Georgian people deserve no less.
